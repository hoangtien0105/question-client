It uses plain, standard SQL so it should work in any brand of RDBMS.\nSELECT t1.*\nFROM mytable t1\n  LEFT OUTER JOIN mytable t2\n    ON (t1.UserId = t2.UserId AND t1.&quot;Date&quot; &lt; t2.&quot;Date&quot;)\nWHERE t2.UserId IS NULL;\n\nIn other words: fetch the row from t1 where no other row exists with the same UserId and a greater Date.\n(I put the identifier &quot;Date&quot; in delimiters because it&apos;s an SQL reserved word.)\nIn case if t1.&quot;Date&quot; = t2.&quot;Date&quot;, doubling appears. Usually tables has auto_inc(seq) key, e.g. id.\nTo avoid doubling can be used follows:\nSELECT t1.*\nFROM mytable t1\n  LEFT OUTER JOIN mytable t2\n    ON t1.UserId = t2.UserId AND ((t1.&quot;Date&quot; &lt; t2.&quot;Date&quot;) \n         OR (t1.&quot;Date&quot; = t2.&quot;Date&quot; AND t1.id &lt; t2.id))\nWHERE t2.UserId IS NULL;\n\n\nRe comment from @Farhan:\nHere&apos;s a more detailed explanation:\nAn outer join attempts to join t1 with t2.  By default, all results of t1 are returned, and if there is a match in t2, it is also returned.  If there is no match in t2 for a given row of t1, then the query still returns the row of t1, and uses NULL as a placeholder for all of t2&apos;s columns.  That&apos;s just how outer joins work in general.\nThe trick in this query is to design the join&apos;s matching condition such that t2 must match the same userid, and a greater date.  The idea being if a row exists in t2 that has a greater date, then the row in t1 it&apos;s compared against can&apos;t be the greatest date for that userid.  But if there is no match -- i.e. if no row exists in t2 with a greater date than the row in t1 -- we know that the row in t1 was the row with the greatest date for the given userid.\nIn those cases (when there&apos;s no match), the columns of t2 will be NULL -- even the columns specified in the join condition.  So that&apos;s why we use WHERE t2.UserId IS NULL, because we&apos;re searching for the cases where no row was found with a greater date for the given userid.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"This will retrieve all rows for which the my_date column value is equal to the maximum value of my_date for that userid.

In the meantime I know this one works.\n\nIf you want to learn about analytic queries, I&apos;d suggest reading http://www.orafaq.com/node/55 and http://www.akadia.com/services/ora_analytic_functions.html.  Here is the short summary.\n\nUnder the hood analytic queries sort the whole dataset, then process it sequentially.  As you process it you partition the dataset according to certain criteria, and then for each row looks at some window (defaults to the first value in the partition to the current row - that default is also the most efficient) and can compute values using a number of analytic functions (the list of which is very similar to the aggregate functions).\n\nIn this case here is what the inner query does.  The whole dataset is sorted by UserId then Date DESC.  Then it processes it in one pass.  For each row you return the UserId and the first Date seen for that UserId (since dates are sorted DESC, that&apos;s the max date).  This gives you your answer with duplicated rows.  Then the outer DISTINCT squashes duplicates.\n\nThis is not a particularly spectacular example of analytic queries.  For a much bigger win consider taking a table of financial receipts and calculating for each user and receipt, a running total of what they paid.  Analytic queries solve that efficiently.  Other solutions are less efficient.  Which is why they are part of the 2003 SQL standard.  (Unfortunately Postgres doesn&apos;t have them yet.

<p>I want to get the UserId, Value for the max(Date) for each UserId. That is, the Value for each UserId that has the latest date. Is there a way to do this simply in SQL? (Preferably Oracle)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Apologies for any ambiguity: I need to get ALL the UserIds. But for each UserId, only that row where that user has the latest date.</p>

<p>I see many people use subqueries or else window functions to do this, but I often do this kind of query without subqueries in the following way.  It uses plain, standard SQL so it should work in any brand of RDBMS.</p>

<p>In other words: fetch the row from <code>t1</code> where no other row exists with the same <code>UserId</code> and a greater Date.</p>
<p>(I put the identifier "Date" in delimiters because it's an SQL reserved word.)</p>
<p>In case if <code>t1."Date" = t2."Date"</code>, doubling appears. Usually tables has <code>auto_inc(seq)</code> key, e.g. <code>id</code>.
To avoid doubling can be used follows:</p>

<p>Re comment from @Farhan:</p>
<p>Here's a more detailed explanation:</p>
<p>An outer join attempts to join <code>t1</code> with <code>t2</code>.  By default, all results of <code>t1</code> are returned, and <em>if</em> there is a match in <code>t2</code>, it is also returned.  If there is no match in <code>t2</code> for a given row of <code>t1</code>, then the query still returns the row of <code>t1</code>, and uses <code>NULL</code> as a placeholder for all of <code>t2</code>'s columns.  That's just how outer joins work in general.</p>
<p>The trick in this query is to design the join's matching condition such that <code>t2</code> must match the <em>same</em> <code>userid</code>, and a <em>greater</em> <code>date</code>.  The idea being if a row exists in <code>t2</code> that has a greater <code>date</code>, then the row in <code>t1</code> it's compared against <em>can't</em> be the greatest <code>date</code> for that <code>userid</code>.  But if there is no match -- i.e. if no row exists in <code>t2</code> with a greater <code>date</code> than the row in <code>t1</code> -- we know that the row in <code>t1</code> was the row with the greatest <code>date</code> for the given <code>userid</code>.</p>
<p>In those cases (when there's no match), the columns of <code>t2</code> will be <code>NULL</code> -- even the columns specified in the join condition.  So that's why we use <code>WHERE t2.UserId IS NULL</code>, because we're searching for the cases where no row was found with a greater <code>date</code> for the given <code>userid</code>.</p>

<p>This will retrieve all rows for which the my_date column value is equal to the maximum value of my_date for that userid. This may retrieve multiple rows for the userid where the maximum date is on multiple rows.</p>

<p>"Analytic functions rock"</p>

<p>Edit: With regard to the first comment ...</p>

<p>"using analytic queries and a self-join defeats the purpose of analytic queries"</p>

<p>There is no self-join in this code. There is instead a predicate placed on the result of the inline view that contains the analytic function -- a very different matter, and completely standard practice.</p>

<p>"The default window in Oracle is from the first row in the partition to the current one"</p>

<p>The windowing clause is only applicable in the presence of the order by clause. With no order by clause, no windowing clause is applied by default and none can be explicitly specified.</p>

<p>The code works.</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">DISTINCT</span>
    UserId
  , MaxValue
<span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> (
    <span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> UserId
      , <span class="hljs-keyword">FIRST</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">Value</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">Over</span> (
          <span class="hljs-keyword">PARTITION</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">BY</span> UserId
          <span class="hljs-keyword">ORDER</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">BY</span> <span class="hljs-type">Date</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">DESC</span>
        ) MaxValue
    <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> SomeTable
  )
</code></pre>

<p>I suspect that you can get rid of the outer query and put distinct on the inner, but I'm not sure.  In the meantime I know this one works.</p>

<p>If you want to learn about analytic queries, I'd suggest reading <a href="http://www.orafaq.com/node/55" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.orafaq.com/node/55</a> and <strike><a href="http://www.akadia.com/services/ora_analytic_functions.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.akadia.com/services/ora_analytic_functions.html</a></strike>.  Here is the short summary.</p>

<p>Under the hood analytic queries sort the whole dataset, then process it sequentially.  As you process it you partition the dataset according to certain criteria, and then for each row looks at some window (defaults to the first value in the partition to the current row - that default is also the most efficient) and can compute values using a number of analytic functions (the list of which is very similar to the aggregate functions).</p>

<p>In this case here is what the inner query does.  The whole dataset is sorted by UserId then Date DESC.  Then it processes it in one pass.  For each row you return the UserId and the first Date seen for that UserId (since dates are sorted DESC, that's the max date).  This gives you your answer with duplicated rows.  Then the outer DISTINCT squashes duplicates.</p>

<p>This is not a particularly spectacular example of analytic queries.  For a much bigger win consider taking a table of financial receipts and calculating for each user and receipt, a running total of what they paid.  Analytic queries solve that efficiently.  Other solutions are less efficient.  Which is why they are part of the 2003 SQL standard.  (Unfortunately Postgres doesn't have them yet.  Grrr...)</p>

<p>In <strong><code>Oracle 12c+</code></strong>, you can use <em>Top n</em> queries along with analytic function <code>rank</code> to achieve this very concisely <em>without</em> subqueries:</p>

<p>You can use FIRST_VALUE instead of MAX and look it up in the explain plan. I didn't have the time to play with it.</p>

<p>Of course, if searching through huge tables, it's probably better if you use FULL hints in your query.</p>

<p>I'm quite late to the party but the following hack will outperform both correlated subqueries and any analytics function but has one restriction: values must convert to strings.

<p>The reason why this code works so well is that it only needs to scan the table once. It does not require any indexes and most importantly it does not need to sort the table, which most analytics functions do. Indexes will help though if you need to filter the result for a single userid.</p>

In the meantime I know this one works.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If you want to learn about analytic queries, I\u0026apos;d suggest reading \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://www.orafaq.com/node/55\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;nofollow noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;http://www.orafaq.com/node/55\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;strike\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://www.akadia.com/services/ora_analytic_functions.html\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;nofollow noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;http://www.akadia.com/services/ora_analytic_functions.html\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strike\u0026gt;.  Here is the short summary.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Under the hood analytic queries sort the whole dataset, then process it sequentially.  As you process it you partition the dataset according to certain criteria, and then for each row looks at some window (defaults to the first value in the partition to the current row - that default is also the most efficient) and can compute values using a number of analytic functions (the list of which is very similar to the aggregate functions).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In this case here is what the inner query does.  The whole dataset is sorted by UserId then Date DESC.  Then it processes it in one pass.  For each row you return the UserId and the first Date seen for that UserId (since dates are sorted DESC, that\u0026apos;s the max date).  This gives you your answer with duplicated rows.
