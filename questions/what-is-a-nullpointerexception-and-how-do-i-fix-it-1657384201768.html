If you want to manipulate the data in a primitive variable you can manipulate that variable directly. By convention primitive types start with a lowercase letter. For example variables of type int or char are primitives.\n\nReferences: variables that contain the memory address of an Object i.e. variables that refer to an Object. If you want to manipulate the Object that a reference variable refers to you must dereference it. Dereferencing usually entails using . to access a method or field, or using [ to index an array. By convention reference types are usually denoted with a type that starts in uppercase. For example variables of type Object are references.\n\n\nConsider the following code where you declare a variable of primitive type int and don&apos;t initialize it:\nint x;\nint y = x+x;\n\nThese two lines will crash the program because no value is specified for x and we are trying to use x&apos;s value to specify y. All primitives have to be initialized to a usable value before they are manipulated.\nNow here is where things get interesting. Reference variables can be set to null which means &quot;I am referencing nothing&quot;. You can get a null value in a reference variable if you explicitly set it that way, or a reference variable is uninitialized and the compiler does not catch it (Java will automatically set the variable to null).\nIf a reference variable is set to null either explicitly by you or through Java automatically, and you attempt to dereference it you get a NullPointerException.\nThe NullPointerException (NPE) typically occurs when you declare a variable but did not create an object and assign it to the variable before trying to use the contents of the variable. So you have a reference to something that does not actually exist.\nTake the following code:\nInteger num;\nnum = new Integer(10);\n\nThe first line declares a variable named num, but it does not actually contain a reference value yet. Since you have not yet said what to point to, Java sets it to null.\nIn the second line, the new keyword is used to instantiate (or create) an object of type Integer, and the reference variable num is assigned to that Integer object.\nIf you attempt to dereference num before creating the object you get a NullPointerException. In the most trivial cases, the compiler will catch the problem and let you know that &quot;num may not have been initialized,&quot; but sometimes you may write code that does not directly create the object.\nFor instance, you may have a method as follows:\npublic void doSomething(SomeObject obj) {\n   // Do something to obj, assumes obj is not null\n   obj.myMethod();\n}\n\nIn which case, you are not creating the object obj, but rather assuming that it was created before the doSomething() method was called. Note, it is possible to call the method like this:\ndoSomething(null);\n\nIn which case, obj is null, and the statement obj.myMethod() will throw a NullPointerException.\nIf the method is intended to do something to the passed-in object as the above method does, it is appropriate to throw the NullPointerException because it&apos;s a programmer error and the programmer will need that information for debugging purposes.\nIn addition to NullPointerExceptions thrown as a result of the method&apos;s logic, you can also check the method arguments for null values and throw NPEs explicitly by adding something like the following near the beginning of a method:\n// Throws an NPE with a custom error message if obj is null\nObjects.requireNonNull(obj, &quot;obj must not be null&quot;);\n\nNote that it&apos;s helpful to say in your error message clearly which object cannot be null. The advantage of validating this is that 1) you can return your own clearer error messages and 2) for the rest of the method you know that unless obj is reassigned, it is not null and can be dereferenced safely.\nAlternatively, there may be cases where the purpose of the method is not solely to operate on the passed in object, and therefore a null parameter may be acceptable. In this case, you would need to check for a null parameter and behave differently. You should also explain this in the documentation. For example, doSomething() could be written as:\n/**\n  * @param obj An optional foo for ____. May be null, in which case\n  *  the result will be ____.\n  */\npublic void doSomething(SomeObject obj) {\n    if(obj == null) {\n       // Do something\n    } else {\n       // Do something else\n    }\n}\n\nFinally, How to pinpoint the exception &amp; cause using Stack Trace\n\nWhat methods/tools can be used to determine the cause so that you stop\nthe exception from causing the program to terminate prematurely?\n\nSonar with find bugs can detect NPE.\nCan sonar catch null pointer exceptions caused by JVM Dynamically\nNow Java 14 has added a new language feature to show the root cause of NullPointerException. This language feature has been part of SAP commercial JVM since 2006.\nIn Java 14, the following is a sample NullPointerException Exception message:\n\nin thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke &quot;java.util.List.size()&quot; because &quot;list&quot; is null\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"NullPointerExceptions are exceptions that occur when you try to use a reference that points to no location in memory (null) as though it were referencing an object.  Calling a method on a null reference or trying to access a field of a null reference will trigger a NullPointerException.  These are the most common, but other ways are listed on the NullPointerException javadoc page.\nProbably the quickest example code I could come up with to illustrate a NullPointerException would be:\npublic class Example {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Object obj = null;\n        obj.hashCode();\n    }\n\n}\n\nOn the first line inside main, I&apos;m explicitly setting the Object reference obj equal to null.  This means I have a reference, but it isn&apos;t pointing to any object.  After that, I try to treat the reference as though it points to an object by calling a method on it.  This results in a NullPointerException because there is no code to execute in the location that the reference is pointing.\n(This is a technicality, but I think it bears mentioning: A reference that points to null isn&apos;t the same as a C pointer that points to an invalid memory location.  A null pointer is literally not pointing anywhere, which is subtly different than pointing to a location that happens to be invalid.)\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"What is a NullPointerException?\n\nA good place to start is the JavaDocs. They have this covered:\n\n\n  Thrown when an application attempts to use null in a case where an\n  object is required. These include:\n  \n  \n  Calling the instance method of a null object.\n  Accessing or modifying the field of a null object.\n  Taking the length of null as if it were an array.\n  Accessing or modifying the slots of null as if it were an array.\n  Throwing null as if it were a Throwable value.\n  \n  \n  Applications should throw instances of this class to indicate other\n  illegal uses of the null object.\n\n\nIt is also the case that if you attempt to use a null reference with synchronized, that will also throw this exception, per the JLS:\n\n\nSynchronizedStatement:\n    synchronized ( Expression ) Block\n\n  \n  \n  Otherwise, if the value of the Expression is null, a NullPointerException is thrown.\n  \n\n\nHow do I fix it?\n\nSo you have a NullPointerException. How do you fix it? Let&apos;s take a simple example which throws a NullPointerException:\n\npublic class Printer {\n    private String name;\n\n    public void setName(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public void print() {\n        printString(name);\n    }\n\n    private void printString(String s) {\n        System.out.println(s + &quot; (&quot; + s.length() + &quot;)&quot;);\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Printer printer = new Printer();\n        printer.print();\n    }\n}\n\n\nIdentify the null values\n\nThe first step is identifying exactly which values are causing the exception. For this, we need to do some debugging. It&apos;s important to learn to read a stacktrace. This will show you where the exception was thrown:\n\nException in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NullPointerException\n    at Printer.printString(Printer.java:13)\n    at Printer.print(Printer.java:9)\n    at Printer.main(Printer.java:19)\n\n\nHere, we see that the exception is thrown on line 13 (in the printString method). Look at the line and check which values are null by\nadding logging statements or using a debugger. We find out that s is null, and calling the length method on it throws the exception. We can see that the program stops throwing the exception when s.length() is removed from the method.\n\nTrace where these values come from\n\nNext check where this value comes from. By following the callers of the method, we see that s is passed in with printString(name) in the print() method, and this.name is null.\n\nTrace where these values should be set\n\nWhere is this.name set? In the setName(String) method. With some more debugging, we can see that this method isn&apos;t called at all. If the method was called, make sure to check the order that these methods are called, and the set method isn&apos;t called after the print method.\n\nThis is enough to give us a solution: add a call to printer.setName() before calling printer.print().\n\nOther fixes\n\nThe variable can have a default value (and setName can prevent it being set to null):\n\nprivate String name = &quot;&quot;;\n\n\nEither the print or printString method can check for null, for example:\n\nprintString((name == null) ? &quot;&quot; : name);\n\n\nOr you can design the class so that name always has a non-null value:\n\npublic class Printer {\n    private final String name;\n\n    public Printer(String name) {\n        this.name = Objects.requireNonNull(name);\n    }\n\n    public void print() {\n        printString(name);\n    }\n\n    private void printString(String s) {\n        System.out.println(s + &quot; (&quot; + s.length() + &quot;)&quot;);\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Printer printer = new Printer(&quot;123&quot;);\n        printer.print();\n    }\n}\n\n\nSee also:\n\n\nAvoiding != null statements in Java?\n\n\nI still can&apos;t find the problem\n\nIf you tried to debug the problem and still don&apos;t have a solution, you can post a question for more help, but make sure to include what you&apos;ve tried so far. At a minimum, include the stacktrace in the question, and mark the important line numbers in the code. Also, try simplifying the code first (see SSCCE).\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Question: What causes a NullPointerException (NPE)?\nAs you should know, Java types are divided into primitive types (boolean, int, etc.) and reference types. Reference types in Java allow you to use the special value null which is the Java way of saying &quot;no object&quot;.\nA NullPointerException is thrown at runtime whenever your program attempts to use a null as if it was a real reference. For example, if you write this:\npublic class Test {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String foo = null;\n        int length = foo.length();   // HERE\n    }\n}\n\nthe statement labeled &quot;HERE&quot; is going to attempt to run the length() method on a null reference, and this will throw a NullPointerException.\nThere are many ways that you could use a null value that will result in a NullPointerException. In fact, the only things that you can do with a null without causing an NPE are:\n\nassign it to a reference variable or read it from a reference variable,\nassign it to an array element or read it from an array element (provided that array reference itself is non-null!),\npass it as a parameter or return it as a result, or\ntest it using the == or != operators, or instanceof.\n\nQuestion: How do I read the NPE stacktrace?\nSuppose that I compile and run the program above:\n$ javac Test.java \n$ java Test\nException in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NullPointerException\n    at Test.main(Test.java:4)\n$\n\nFirst observation: the compilation succeeds! The problem in the program is NOT a compilation error. It is a runtime error. (Some IDEs may warn your program will always throw an exception ... but the standard javac compiler doesn&apos;t.)\nSecond observation: when I run the program, it outputs two lines of &quot;gobbledy-gook&quot;. WRONG!! That&apos;s not gobbledy-gook. It is a stacktrace ... and it provides vital information that will help you track down the error in your code if you take the time to read it carefully.\nSo let&apos;s look at what it says:\nException in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NullPointerException\n\nThe first line of the stack trace tells you a number of things:\n\nIt tells you the name of the Java thread in which the exception was thrown.  For a simple program with one thread (like this one), it will be &quot;main&quot;. Let&apos;s move on ...\nIt tells you the full name of the exception that was thrown; i.e. java.lang.NullPointerException.\nIf the exception has an associated error message, that will be output after the exception name. NullPointerException is unusual in this respect, because it rarely has an error message.\n\nThe second line is the most important one in diagnosing an NPE.\nat Test.main(Test.java:4)\n\nThis tells us a number of things:\n\n&quot;at Test.main&quot; says that we were in the main method of the Test class.\n&quot;Test.java:4&quot; gives the source filename of the class, AND it tells us that the statement where this occurred is in line 4 of the file.\n\nIf you count the lines in the file above, line 4 is the one that I labeled with the &quot;HERE&quot; comment.\nNote that in a more complicated example, there will be lots of lines in the NPE stack trace. But you can be sure that the second line (the first &quot;at&quot; line) will tell you where the NPE was thrown1.\nIn short, the stack trace will tell us unambiguously which statement of the program has thrown the NPE.\nSee also: What is a stack trace, and how can I use it to debug my application errors?\n1 - Not quite true. There are things called nested exceptions...\nQuestion: How do I track down the cause of the NPE exception in my code?\nThis is the hard part. The short answer is to apply logical inference to the evidence provided by the stack trace, the source code, and the relevant API documentation.\nLet&apos;s illustrate with the simple example (above) first. We start by looking at the line that the stack trace has told us is where the NPE happened:\nint length = foo.length(); // HERE\n\nHow can that throw an NPE?\nIn fact, there is only one way: it can only happen if foo has the value null.  We then try to run the length() method on null and... BANG!\nBut (I hear you say) what if the NPE was thrown inside the length() method call?\nWell, if that happened, the stack trace would look different. The first &quot;at&quot; line would say that the exception was thrown in some line in the java.lang.String class and line 4 of Test.java would be the second &quot;at&quot; line.\nSo where did that null come from? In this case, it is obvious, and it is obvious what we need to do to fix it. (Assign a non-null value to foo.)\nOK, so let&apos;s try a slightly more tricky example. This will require some logical deduction.\npublic class Test {\n\n    private static String[] foo = new String[2];\n\n    private static int test(String[] bar, int pos) {\n        return bar[pos].length();\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int length = test(foo, 1);\n    }\n}\n\n$ javac Test.java \n$ java Test\nException in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NullPointerException\n    at Test.test(Test.java:6)\n    at Test.main(Test.java:10)\n$ \n\nSo now we have two &quot;at&quot; lines. The first one is for this line:\nreturn args[pos].length();\n\nand the second one is for this line:\nint length = test(foo, 1);\n    \n\nLooking at the first line, how could that throw an NPE?  There are two ways:\n\nIf the value of bar is null then bar[pos] will throw an NPE.\nIf the value of bar[pos] is null then calling length() on it will throw an NPE.\n\nNext, we need to figure out which of those scenarios explains what is actually happening. We will start by exploring the first one:\nWhere does bar come from? It is a parameter to the test method call, and if we look at how test was called, we can see that it comes from the foo static variable. In addition, we can see clearly that we initialized foo to a non-null value.  That is sufficient to tentatively dismiss this explanation. (In theory, something else could change foo to null ... but that is not happening here.)\nSo what about our second scenario? Well, we can see that pos is 1, so that means that foo[1] must be null. Is this possible?\nIndeed it is! And that is the problem. When we initialize like this:\nprivate static String[] foo = new String[2];\n\nwe allocate a String[] with two elements that are initialized to null. After that, we have not changed the contents of foo ... so foo[1] will still be null.\nWhat about on Android?\nOn Android, tracking down the immediate cause of an NPE is a bit simpler.  The exception message will typically tell you the (compile time) type of the null reference you are using and the method you were attempting to call when the NPE was thrown.  This simplifies the process of pinpointing the immediate cause.\nBut on the flipside, Android has some common platform-specific causes for NPEs.  A very common is when getViewById unexpectedly returns a null.  My advice would be to search for Q&amp;As about the cause of the unexpected null return value.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"It&apos;s like you are trying to access an object which is null.

There is no way we can work with it, so this object is ready to be garbage collected, and at some point, the VM will free the memory used by this object and will allocate another.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution11","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Another occurrence of a NullPointerException occurs when one declares an object array, then immediately tries to dereference elements inside of it.\n\nString[] phrases = new String[10];\nString keyPhrase = &quot;Bird&quot;;\nfor(String phrase : phrases) {\n    System.out.println(phrase.equals(keyPhrase));\n}\n\n\nThis particular NPE can be avoided if the comparison order is reversed; namely, use .equals on a guaranteed non-null object.\n\nAll elements inside of an array are initialized to their common initial value; for any type of object array, that means that all elements are null.\n\nYou must initialize the elements in the array before accessing or dereferencing them.\n\nString[] phrases = new String[] {&quot;The bird&quot;, &quot;A bird&quot;, &quot;My bird&quot;, &quot;Bird&quot;};\nString keyPhrase = &quot;Bird&quot;;\nfor(String phrase : phrases) {\n    System.out.println(phrase.equals(keyPhrase));\n}\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution12","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0}],"@type":"Question"}}</script><meta name="next-head-count" content="14"/><link rel="preload" href="/_next/static/css/9fb80f4eb9e2d3c9.css" as="style"/><link rel="stylesheet" href="/_next/static/css/9fb80f4eb9e2d3c9.css" data-n-g=""/><noscript data-n-css=""></noscript><script defer="" nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-0d1b80a048d4787e.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-cb7634a8b6194820.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework-4556c45dd113b893.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-25e5079ab4bd6ecd.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-18d80dcb3110b1ad.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/29107295-fbcfe2172188e46f.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/532-fec3344a80918110.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/495-bb1d5b202c02d7f2.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/817-363561828babdd16.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/81-89fd2eaadd8354ed.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/questions/%5Bslug%5D-16d8c84aea765d4e.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/D-Vv5KfwuaE883xCdWfex/_buildManifest.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/D-Vv5KfwuaE883xCdWfex/_ssgManifest.js" defer=""></script><style data-styled="" data-styled-version="5.3.5">.dlbxiY code{padding:5px;color:hsl(210deg 8% 15%);background-color:hsl(210deg 8% 90%);border-radius:3px;}/*!sc*/

<p>What are Null Pointer Exceptions (<code>java.lang.NullPointerException</code>) and what causes them?</p>

<p>What methods/tools can be used to determine the cause so that you stop the exception from causing the program to terminate prematurely?</p>
    </div></div></div><div class="sc-344134f6-2 EUowZ"><div id="solution1" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl border p-10 shadow-md w-9/12 bg-white"><h4 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 1</h4><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>There are two overarching types of variables in Java:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><em>Primitives</em>: variables that contain data. If you want to manipulate the data in a primitive variable you can manipulate that variable directly. By convention primitive types start with a lowercase letter. For example variables of type <code>int</code> or <code>char</code> are primitives.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>References</em>: variables that contain the memory address of an <code>Object</code> i.e. variables that <em>refer</em> to an <code>Object</code>. If you want to manipulate the <code>Object</code> that a reference variable refers to you must <em>dereference</em> it. Dereferencing usually entails using <code>.</code> to access a method or field, or using <code>[</code> to index an array. By convention reference types are usually denoted with a type that starts in uppercase. For example variables of type <code>Object</code> are references.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Consider the following code where you declare a variable of <em>primitive</em> type <code>int</code> and don't initialize it:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> x;
<span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">y</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> x+x;
</code></pre>
<p>These two lines will crash the program because no value is specified for <code>x</code> and we are trying to use <code>x</code>'s value to specify <code>y</code>. All primitives have to be initialized to a usable value before they are manipulated.</p>
<p>Now here is where things get interesting. <em>Reference</em> variables can be set to <code>null</code> which means "<strong>I am referencing <em>nothing</em></strong>". You can get a <code>null</code> value in a reference variable if you explicitly set it that way, or a reference variable is uninitialized and the compiler does not catch it (Java will automatically set the variable to <code>null</code>).</p>
<p>If a reference variable is set to null either explicitly by you or through Java automatically, and you attempt to <em>dereference</em> it you get a <code>NullPointerException</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>NullPointerException</code> (NPE) typically occurs when you declare a variable but did not create an object and assign it to the variable before trying to use the contents of the variable. So you have a reference to something that does not actually exist.</p>
<p>Take the following code:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">Integer num;
num = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Integer</span>(<span class="hljs-number">10</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>The first line declares a variable named <code>num</code>, but it does not actually contain a reference value yet. Since you have not yet said what to point to, Java sets it to <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>In the second line, the <code>new</code> keyword is used to instantiate (or create) an object of type <code>Integer</code>, and the reference variable <code>num</code> is assigned to that <code>Integer</code> object.</p>
<p>If you attempt to dereference <code>num</code> <em>before</em> creating the object you get a <code>NullPointerException</code>. In the most trivial cases, the compiler will catch the problem and let you know that "<code>num may not have been initialized</code>," but sometimes you may write code that does not directly create the object.</p>
<p>For instance, you may have a method as follows:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">doSomething</span><span class="hljs-params">(SomeObject obj)</span> {
   <span class="hljs-comment">// Do something to obj, assumes obj is not null</span>
   obj.myMethod();
}
</code></pre>
<p>In which case, you are not creating the object <code>obj</code>, but rather assuming that it was created before the <code>doSomething()</code> method was called. Note, it is possible to call the method like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">doSomething(<span class="hljs-literal">null</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>In which case, <code>obj</code> is <code>null</code>, and the statement <code>obj.myMethod()</code> will throw a <code>NullPointerException</code>.</p>
<p>If the method is intended to do something to the passed-in object as the above method does, it is appropriate to throw the <code>NullPointerException</code> because it's a programmer error and the programmer will need that information for debugging purposes.</p>
<p>In addition to <code>NullPointerException</code>s thrown as a result of the method's logic, you can also check the method arguments for <code>null</code> values and throw NPEs explicitly by adding something like the following near the beginning of a method:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-comment">// Throws an NPE with a custom error message if obj is null</span>
Objects.requireNonNull(obj, <span class="hljs-string">"obj must not be null"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Note that it's helpful to say in your error message clearly <em>which</em> object cannot be <code>null</code>. The advantage of validating this is that 1) you can return your own clearer error messages and 2) for the rest of the method you know that unless <code>obj</code> is reassigned, it is not null and can be dereferenced safely.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there may be cases where the purpose of the method is not solely to operate on the passed in object, and therefore a null parameter may be acceptable. In this case, you would need to check for a <strong>null parameter</strong> and behave differently. You should also explain this in the documentation. For example, <code>doSomething()</code> could be written as:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-comment">/**
  * <span class="hljs-doctag">@param</span> obj An optional foo for ____. May be null, in which case
  *  the result will be ____.
  */</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">doSomething</span><span class="hljs-params">(SomeObject obj)</span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(obj == <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>) {
       <span class="hljs-comment">// Do something</span>
    } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
       <span class="hljs-comment">// Do something else</span>
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now Java 14 has added a new language feature to show the root cause of NullPointerException. This language feature has been part of SAP commercial JVM since 2006.</p>
<p>In Java 14, the following is a sample NullPointerException Exception message:</p>

<p><code>NullPointerException</code>s are exceptions that occur when you try to use a reference that points to no location in memory (null) as though it were referencing an object.  Calling a method on a null reference or trying to access a field of a null reference will trigger a <code>NullPointerException</code>.  These are the most common, but other ways are listed on the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>NullPointerException</code></a> javadoc page.</p>
<p>Probably the quickest example code I could come up with to illustrate a <code>NullPointerException</code> would be:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Example</span> {

    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">main</span><span class="hljs-params">(String[] args)</span> {
        <span class="hljs-type">Object</span> <span class="hljs-variable">obj</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>;
        obj.hashCode();
    }

}
</code></pre>
<p>On the first line inside <code>main</code>, I'm explicitly setting the <code>Object</code> reference <code>obj</code> equal to <code>null</code>.  This means I have a reference, but it isn't pointing to any object.  After that, I try to treat the reference as though it points to an object by calling a method on it.  This results in a <code>NullPointerException</code> because there is no code to execute in the location that the reference is pointing.</p>
<p>(This is a technicality, but I think it bears mentioning: A reference that points to null isn't the same as a C pointer that points to an invalid memory location.  A null pointer is literally not pointing <em>anywhere</em>, which is subtly different than pointing to a location that happens to be invalid.)</p>

<h1>What is a NullPointerException?</h1>

<p>A good place to start is the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html" rel="noreferrer">JavaDocs</a>. They have this covered:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thrown when an application attempts to use null in a case where an
  object is required. These include:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Calling the instance method of a null object.</li>
  <li>Accessing or modifying the field of a null object.</li>
  <li>Taking the length of null as if it were an array.</li>
  <li>Accessing or modifying the slots of null as if it were an array.</li>
  <li>Throwing null as if it were a Throwable value.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Applications should throw instances of this class to indicate other
  illegal uses of the null object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is also the case that if you attempt to use a null reference with <code>synchronized</code>, that will also throw this exception, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.19" rel="noreferrer">per the JLS</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">SynchronizedStatement:
    <span class="hljs-keyword">synchronized</span> ( Expression ) Block
</code></pre>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Otherwise, if the value of the Expression is null, a <code>NullPointerException</code> is thrown.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h1>How do I fix it?</h1>

<p>So you have a <code>NullPointerException</code>. How do you fix it? Let's take a simple example which throws a <code>NullPointerException</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Printer</span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> String name;

    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">setName</span><span class="hljs-params">(String name)</span> {
        <span class="hljs-built_in">this</span>.name = name;
    }

    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">print</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> {
        printString(name);
    }

    <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">printString</span><span class="hljs-params">(String s)</span> {
        System.out.println(s + <span class="hljs-string">" ("</span> + s.length() + <span class="hljs-string">")"</span>);
    }

    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">main</span><span class="hljs-params">(String[] args)</span> {
        <span class="hljs-type">Printer</span> <span class="hljs-variable">printer</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Printer</span>();
        printer.print();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Identify the null values</strong></p>

<p>The first step is identifying exactly <em>which values are causing the exception</em>. For this, we need to do some debugging. It's important to learn to read a <em>stacktrace</em>. This will show you where the exception was thrown:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">Exception in thread <span class="hljs-string">"main"</span> java.lang.NullPointerException
    at Printer.printString(Printer.java:<span class="hljs-number">13</span>)
    at Printer.print(Printer.java:<span class="hljs-number">9</span>)
    at Printer.main(Printer.java:<span class="hljs-number">19</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we see that the exception is thrown on line 13 (in the <code>printString</code> method). Look at the line and check which values are null by
adding <em>logging statements</em> or using a <em>debugger</em>. We find out that <code>s</code> is null, and calling the <code>length</code> method on it throws the exception. We can see that the program stops throwing the exception when <code>s.length()</code> is removed from the method.</p>

<p><strong>Trace where these values come from</strong></p>

<p>Next check where this value comes from. By following the callers of the method, we see that <code>s</code> is passed in with <code>printString(name)</code> in the <code>print()</code> method, and <code>this.name</code> is null.</p>

<p><strong>Trace where these values should be set</strong></p>

<p>Where is <code>this.name</code> set? In the <code>setName(String)</code> method. With some more debugging, we can see that this method isn't called at all. If the method was called, make sure to check the <em>order</em> that these methods are called, and the set method isn't called <em>after</em> the print method.</p>

<p>This is enough to give us a solution: add a call to <code>printer.setName()</code> before calling <code>printer.print()</code>.</p>

<h1>Other fixes</h1>

<p>The variable can have a <em>default value</em> (and <code>setName</code> can prevent it being set to null):</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">name</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">""</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>Either the <code>print</code> or <code>printString</code> method can <em>check for null</em>, for example:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">printString((name == <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>) ? <span class="hljs-string">""</span> : name);
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can design the class so that <code>name</code> <em>always has a non-null value</em>:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Printer</span> {

<h2>Question: What causes a <code>NullPointerException</code> (NPE)?</h2>
<p>As you should know, Java types are divided into <em>primitive types</em> (<code>boolean</code>, <code>int</code>, etc.) and <em>reference types</em>. Reference types in Java allow you to use the special value <code>null</code> which is the Java way of saying "no object".</p>
<p>A <code>NullPointerException</code> is thrown at runtime whenever your program attempts to use a <code>null</code> as if it was a real reference. For example, if you write this:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Test</span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">main</span><span class="hljs-params">(String[] args)</span> {
        <span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">foo</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>;
        <span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">length</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> foo.length();   <span class="hljs-comment">// HERE</span>
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>the statement labeled "HERE" is going to attempt to run the <code>length()</code> method on a <code>null</code> reference, and this will throw a <code>NullPointerException</code>.</p>
<p>There are many ways that you could use a <code>null</code> value that will result in a <code>NullPointerException</code>. In fact, the only things that you <em>can</em> do with a <code>null</code> without causing an NPE are:</p>
<ul>
<li>assign it to a reference variable or read it from a reference variable,</li>
<li>assign it to an array element or read it from an array element (provided that array reference itself is non-null!),</li>
<li>pass it as a parameter or return it as a result, or</li>
<li>test it using the <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code> operators, or <code>instanceof</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Question: How do I read the NPE stacktrace?</h2>
<p>Suppose that I compile and run the program above:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">$ javac Test.java 
$ java Test
Exception in thread <span class="hljs-string">"main"</span> java.lang.NullPointerException
    at Test.main(Test.java:<span class="hljs-number">4</span>)
$
</code></pre>
<p>First observation: the compilation succeeds! The problem in the program is NOT a compilation error. It is a <em>runtime</em> error. (Some IDEs may warn your program will always throw an exception ... but the standard <code>javac</code> compiler doesn't.)</p>
<p>Second observation: when I run the program, it outputs two lines of "gobbledy-gook". <strong>WRONG!!</strong> That's not gobbledy-gook. It is a stacktrace ... and it provides <em>vital information</em> that will help you track down the error in your code if you take the time to read it carefully.</p>
<p>So let's look at what it says:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">Exception in thread <span class="hljs-string">"main"</span> java.lang.NullPointerException
</code></pre>
<p>The first line of the stack trace tells you a number of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>It tells you the name of the Java thread in which the exception was thrown.  For a simple program with one thread (like this one), it will be "main". Let's move on ...</li>
<li>It tells you the full name of the exception that was thrown; i.e. <code>java.lang.NullPointerException</code>.</li>
<li>If the exception has an associated error message, that will be output after the exception name. <code>NullPointerException</code> is unusual in this respect, because it rarely has an error message.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second line is the most important one in diagnosing an NPE.</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">at Test.main(Test.java:<span class="hljs-number">4</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>This tells us a number of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>"at Test.main" says that we were in the <code>main</code> method of the <code>Test</code> class.</li>
<li>"Test.java:4" gives the source filename of the class, AND it tells us that the statement where this occurred is in line 4 of the file.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you count the lines in the file above, line 4 is the one that I labeled with the "HERE" comment.</p>
<p>Note that in a more complicated example, there will be lots of lines in the NPE stack trace. But you can be sure that the second line (the first "at" line) will tell you where the NPE was thrown<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>In short, the stack trace will tell us unambiguously which statement of the program has thrown the NPE.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/3988788/2775450">What is a stack trace, and how can I use it to debug my application errors?</a></p>
<p><sup>1 - Not quite true. There are things called nested exceptions...</sup></p>
<h2>Question: How do I track down the cause of the NPE exception in my code?</h2>
<p>This is the hard part. The short answer is to apply logical inference to the evidence provided by the stack trace, the source code, and the relevant API documentation.</p>
<p>Let's illustrate with the simple example (above) first. We start by looking at the line that the stack trace has told us is where the NPE happened:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">length</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> foo.length(); <span class="hljs-comment">// HERE</span>
</code></pre>
<p>How can that throw an NPE?</p>
<p>In fact, there is only one way: it can only happen if <code>foo</code> has the value <code>null</code>.  We then try to run the <code>length()</code> method on <code>null</code> and... BANG!</p>
<p>But (I hear you say) what if the NPE was thrown inside the <code>length()</code> method call?</p>
<p>Well, if that happened, the stack trace would look different. The first "at" line would say that the exception was thrown in some line in the <code>java.lang.String</code> class and line 4 of <code>Test.java</code> would be the second "at" line.</p>
<p>So where did that <code>null</code> come from? In this case, it is obvious, and it is obvious what we need to do to fix it. (Assign a non-null value to <code>foo</code>.)</p>
<p>OK, so let's try a slightly more tricky example. This will require some <em>logical deduction</em>.</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Test</span> {

    <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> String[] foo = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>[<span class="hljs-number">2</span>];

    <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">test</span><span class="hljs-params">(String[] bar, <span class="hljs-type">int</span> pos)</span> {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> bar[pos].length();
    }

    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">main</span><span class="hljs-params">(String[] args)</span> {
        <span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">length</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> test(foo, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>);
    }
}

$ javac Test.java 
$ java Test
Exception in thread <span class="hljs-string">"main"</span> java.lang.NullPointerException
    at Test.test(Test.java:<span class="hljs-number">6</span>)
    at Test.main(Test.java:<span class="hljs-number">10</span>)
$ 
</code></pre>
<p>So now we have two "at" lines. The first one is for this line:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> args[pos].length();
</code></pre>
<p>and the second one is for this line:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">length</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> test(foo, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>);
    
</code></pre>
<p>Looking at the first line, how could that throw an NPE?  There are two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the value of <code>bar</code> is <code>null</code> then <code>bar[pos]</code> will throw an NPE.</li>
<li>If the value of <code>bar[pos]</code> is <code>null</code> then calling <code>length()</code> on it will throw an NPE.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we need to figure out which of those scenarios explains what is actually happening. We will start by exploring the first one:</p>
<p>Where does <code>bar</code> come from? It is a parameter to the <code>test</code> method call, and if we look at how <code>test</code> was called, we can see that it comes from the <code>foo</code> static variable. In addition, we can see clearly that we initialized <code>foo</code> to a non-null value.  That is sufficient to tentatively dismiss this explanation. (In theory, something else could <em>change</em> <code>foo</code> to <code>null</code> ... but that is not happening here.)</p>
<p>So what about our second scenario? Well, we can see that <code>pos</code> is <code>1</code>, so that means that <code>foo[1]</code> must be <code>null</code>. Is this possible?</p>
<p>Indeed it is! And that is the problem. When we initialize like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> String[] foo = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>[<span class="hljs-number">2</span>];
</code></pre>
<p>we allocate a <code>String[]</code> with two elements <em>that are initialized to <code>null</code></em>. After that, we have not changed the contents of <code>foo</code> ... so <code>foo[1]</code> will still be <code>null</code>.</p>
<h2>What about on Android?</h2>
<p>On Android, tracking down the immediate cause of an NPE is a bit simpler.  The exception message will typically tell you the (compile time) type of the null reference you are using <em>and</em> the method you were attempting to call when the NPE was thrown.  This simplifies the process of pinpointing the immediate cause.</p>
<p>But on the flipside, Android has some common platform-specific causes for NPEs.  A very common is when <code>getViewById</code> unexpectedly returns a <code>null</code>.  My advice would be to search for Q&amp;As about the cause of the unexpected <code>null</code> return value.</p>

<p>It's like you are trying to access an object which is <code>null</code>. Consider below example:</p>

<p>At this time you have just <strong>declared</strong> this object but not <strong>initialized or instantiated</strong>. And whenever you try to access any property or method in it, it will throw  <code>NullPointerException</code> which makes sense.</p>

<p>A <code>null</code> pointer is one that points to nowhere.  When you dereference a pointer <code>p</code>, you say "give me the data at the location stored in "p".

<li>Use the <code>final</code> modifier to enforce good initialization.</li>
<li>Avoid returning null in methods, for example returning empty collections when applicable.</li>
<li>Use annotations <a href="https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/validation/constraints/NotNull.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>@NotNull</code></a> and <a href="https://javadoc.io/static/com.github.spotbugs/spotbugs-annotations/3.1.12/edu/umd/cs/findbugs/annotations/Nullable.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>@Nullable</code></a></li>
<li>Fail fast and use asserts to avoid propagation of null objects through the whole application when they shouldn't be null.</li>
<li>Use equals with a known object first: <code>if("knownObject".equals(unknownObject)</code></li>
<li>Prefer <code>valueOf()</code> over <code>toString()</code>.</li>
<li>Use null safe <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/apidocs/org/apache/commons/lang3/StringUtils.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>StringUtils</code></a> methods <code>StringUtils.isEmpty(null)</code>.</li>

<p>In Java, everything (excluding primitive types) is in the form of a class.</p>

<p>If you want to use any object then you have two phases:</p>

<ol>
<li>Declare</li>
<li>Initialization</li>
</ol>

<p>Example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Declaration: <code>Object object;</code></li>
<li>Initialization: <code>object = new Object();</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Same for the array concept:</p>

<ul>
<li>Declaration: <code>Item item[] = new Item[5];</code></li>
<li>Initialization: <code>item[0] = new Item();</code></li>
</ul>

<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29" rel="noreferrer">Java</a> all the variables you declare are actually "references" to the objects (or primitives) and not the objects themselves.</p>

<p>When you attempt to execute one object method, the reference asks the living object to execute that method. But if the reference is referencing NULL (nothing, zero, void, nada)  then there is no way the method gets executed. Then the runtime let you know this by throwing a NullPointerException.</p>

<p>Your reference is "pointing" to null, thus "Null -&gt; Pointer".</p>

<p>The object lives in the VM memory space and the only way to access it is using <code>this</code> references. Take this example:</p>

<p>This an important thing to know - when there are no more references to an object (in the example above when <code>reference</code> and <code>otherReference</code> both point to null) then the object is "unreachable". There is no way we can work with it, so this object is ready to be garbage collected, and at some point, the VM will free the memory used by this object and will allocate another.</p>

The short answer is to apply logical inference to the evidence provided by the stack trace, the source code, and the relevant API documentation.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Let\u0026apos;s illustrate with the simple example (above) first. We start by looking at the line that the stack trace has told us is where the NPE happened:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-java s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-java\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-type\u0026quot;\u0026gt;int\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-variable\u0026quot;\u0026gt;length\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-operator\u0026quot;\u0026gt;=\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; foo.length(); \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-comment\u0026quot;\u0026gt;// HERE\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;How can that throw an NPE?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In fact, there is only one way: it can only happen if \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;foo\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; has the value \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;null\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.  We then try to run the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;length()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; method on \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;null\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and... BANG!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;But (I hear you say) what if the NPE was thrown inside the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;length()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; method call?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Well, if that happened, the stack trace would look different. The first \u0026quot;at\u0026quot; line would say that the exception was thrown in some line in the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;java.lang.String\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; class and line 4 of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Test.java\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; would be the second \u0026quot;at\u0026quot; line.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So where did that \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;null\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; come from? In this case, it is obvious, and it is obvious what we need to do to fix it. (Assign a non-null value to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;foo\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;OK, so let\u0026apos;s try a slightly more tricky example.

There are two ways:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;If the value of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;bar\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;null\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; then \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;bar[pos]\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; will throw an NPE.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;If the value of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;bar[pos]\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;null\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; then calling \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;length()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; on it will throw an NPE.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Next, we need to figure out which of those scenarios explains what is actually happening. We will start by exploring the first one:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Where does \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;bar\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; come from? It is a parameter to the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;test\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; method call, and if we look at how \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;test\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; was called, we can see that it comes from the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;foo\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; static variable. In addition, we can see clearly that we initialized \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;foo\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to a non-null value.  That is sufficient to tentatively dismiss this explanation. (In theory, something else could \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;change\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;foo\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;null\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; ... but that is not happening here.)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So what about our second scenario? Well, we can see that \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;pos\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;1\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, so that means that \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;foo[1]\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; must be \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;null\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. Is this possible?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Indeed it is! And that is the problem. When we initialize like this:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-java s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-java\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;private\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;static\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; String[] foo = \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;new\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title class_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;String\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;[\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-number\u0026quot;\u0026gt;2\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;];\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;we allocate a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;String[]\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; with two elements \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;that are initialized to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;null\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;. After that, we have not changed the contents of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;foo\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; ... so \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;foo[1]\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; will still be \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;null\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;What about on Android?\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;On Android, tracking down the immediate cause of an NPE is a bit simpler.  The exception message will typically tell you the (compile time) type of the null reference you are using \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;and\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; the method you were attempting to call when the NPE was thrown.  This simplifies the process of pinpointing the immediate cause.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;But on the flipside, Android has some common platform-specific causes for NPEs.  A very common is when \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;getViewById\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; unexpectedly returns a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;null\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.
