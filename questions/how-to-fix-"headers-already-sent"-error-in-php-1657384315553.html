When running my script, I am getting several errors like this:


  Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /some/file.php:12) in /some/file.php on line 23


The lines mentioned in the error messages contain header() and setcookie() calls.

What could be the reason for this? And how to fix it?

PHP scripts mainly generate HTML content, but also pass a\nset of HTTP/CGI headers to the webserver:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nPowered-By: PHP/5.3.7\nVary: Accept-Encoding\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\n\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;PHP page output page&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Content&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some more output follows...&lt;/p&gt;\nand &lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt; &lt;img src=internal-icon-delayed&gt; &lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe page/output always follows the headers. PHP has to pass the\nheaders to the webserver first. It can only do that once.\nAfter the double linebreak it can nevermore amend them.\nWhen PHP receives the first output (print, echo, &lt;html&gt;) it will\nflush all collected headers. Afterward it can send all the output\nit wants. But sending further HTTP headers is impossible then.\nHow can you find out where the premature output occurred?\nThe header() warning contains all relevant information to\nlocate the problem cause:\n\nWarning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by\n(output started at /www/usr2345/htdocs/auth.php:52) in\n/www/usr2345/htdocs/index.php on line 100\n\nHere &quot;line 100&quot; refers to the script where the header() invocation failed.\nThe &quot;output started at&quot; note within the parenthesis is more significant.\nIt denominates the source of previous output. In this example, it&apos;s auth.php\nand line 52. That&apos;s where you had to look for premature output.\nTypical causes:\n\nPrint, echo\nIntentional output from print and echo statements will terminate the opportunity to send HTTP headers. The application flow must be restructured to avoid that. Use functions\nand templating schemes. Ensure header() calls occur before messages\nare written out.\nFunctions that produce output include\n\nprint, echo, printf, vprintf\ntrigger_error, ob_flush, ob_end_flush, var_dump, print_r\nreadfile, passthru, flush, imagepng, imagejpeg\n\n among others and user-defined functions.\n\nRaw HTML areas\nUnparsed HTML sections in a .php file are direct output as well.\nScript conditions that will trigger a header() call must be noted\nbefore any raw &lt;html&gt; blocks.\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;?php\n    // Too late for headers already.\n\nUse a templating scheme to separate processing from output logic.\n\nPlace form processing code atop scripts.\nUse temporary string variables to defer messages.\nThe actual output logic and intermixed HTML output should follow last.\n\n\n\nWhitespace before &lt;?php for &quot;script.php line 1&quot; warnings\nIf the warning refers to output inline 1, then it&apos;s mostly\nleading whitespace, text or HTML before the opening &lt;?php token.\n &lt;?php\n# There&apos;s a SINGLE space/newline before &lt;? - Which already seals it.\n\nSimilarly it can occur for appended scripts or script sections:\n?&gt;\n\n&lt;?php\n\nPHP actually eats up a single linebreak after close tags. But it won&apos;t\ncompensate multiple newlines or tabs or spaces shifted into such gaps.\n\nUTF-8 BOM\nLinebreaks and spaces alone can be a problem. But there are also &quot;invisible&quot;\ncharacter sequences that can cause this. Most famously the\nUTF-8 BOM (Byte-Order-Mark)\nwhich isn&apos;t displayed by most text editors. It&apos;s the byte sequence EF BB BF, which is optional and redundant for UTF-8 encoded documents. PHP however has to treat it as raw output. It may show up as the characters ï»¿ in the output (if the client interprets the document as Latin-1) or similar &quot;garbage&quot;.\nIn particular graphical editors and Java-based IDEs are oblivious to its\npresence. They don&apos;t visualize it (obliged by the Unicode standard).\nMost programmer and console editors however do:\n\nThere it&apos;s easy to recognize the problem early on. Other editors may identify\nits presence in a file/settings menu (Notepad++ on Windows can identify and\nremedy the problem),\nAnother option to inspect the BOMs presence is resorting to an hexeditor.\nOn *nix systems hexdump is usually available,\nif not a graphical variant which simplifies auditing these and other issues:\n\nAn easy fix is to set the text editor to save files as &quot;UTF-8 (no BOM)&quot;\nor similar to such nomenclature. Often newcomers otherwise resort to creating new files and just copy&amp;pasting the previous code back in.\nCorrection utilities \nThere are also automated tools to examine and rewrite text files\n(sed/awk or recode).\nFor PHP specifically there&apos;s the phptags tag tidier.\nIt rewrites close and open tags into long and short forms, but also easily\nfixes leading and trailing whitespace, Unicode and UTF-x BOM issues:\nphptags  --whitespace  *.php\n\nIt&apos;s safe to use on a whole include or project directory.\n\nWhitespace after ?&gt;\nIf the error source is mentioned as behind the\nclosing ?&gt;\nthen this is where some whitespace or the raw text got written out.\nThe PHP end marker does not terminate script execution at this point. Any text/space characters after it will be written out as page content\nstill.\nIt&apos;s commonly advised, in particular to newcomers, that trailing ?&gt; PHP\nclose tags should be omitted. This eschews a small portion of these cases.\n(Quite commonly include()d scripts are the culprit.)\n\nError source mentioned as &quot;Unknown on line 0&quot;\nIt&apos;s typically a PHP extension or php.ini setting if no error source\nis concretized.\n\nIt&apos;s occasionally the gzip stream encoding setting\nor the ob_gzhandler.\nBut it could also be any doubly loaded extension= module\ngenerating an implicit PHP startup/warning message.\n\n\n\nPreceding error messages\nIf another PHP statement or expression causes a warning message or\nnotice being printed out, that also counts as premature output.\nIn this case you need to eschew the error,\ndelay the statement execution, or suppress the message with e.g.\nisset() or @() -\nwhen either doesn&apos;t obstruct debugging later on.\n\n\nNo error message\nIf you have error_reporting or display_errors disabled per php.ini,\nthen no warning will show up. But ignoring errors won&apos;t make the problem go\naway. Headers still can&apos;t be sent after premature output.\nSo when header(&quot;Location: ...&quot;) redirects silently fail it&apos;s very\nadvisable to probe for warnings. Reenable them with two simple commands\natop the invocation script:\nerror_reporting(E_ALL);\nini_set(&quot;display_errors&quot;, 1);\n\nOr set_error_handler(&quot;var_dump&quot;); if all else fails.\nSpeaking of redirect headers, you should often use an idiom like\nthis for final code paths:\nexit(header(&quot;Location: /finished.html&quot;));\n\nPreferably even a utility function, which prints a user message\nin case of header() failures.\nOutput buffering as a workaround\nPHPs output buffering\nis a workaround to alleviate this issue. It often works reliably, but shouldn&apos;t\nsubstitute for proper application structuring and separating output from control\nlogic. Its actual purpose is minimizing chunked transfers to the webserver.\n\nThe output_buffering=\nsetting nevertheless can help.\nConfigure it in the php.ini\nor via .htaccess\nor even .user.ini on\nmodern FPM/FastCGI setups.\nEnabling it will allow PHP to buffer output instead of passing it to the webserver instantly. PHP thus can aggregate HTTP headers.\n\nIt can likewise be engaged with a call to ob_start();\natop the invocation script. Which however is less reliable for multiple reasons:\n\nEven if &lt;?php ob_start(); ?&gt; starts the first script, whitespace or a\nBOM might get shuffled before, rendering it ineffective.\n\nIt can conceal whitespace for HTML output. But as soon as the application logic attempts to send binary content (a generated image for example),\nthe buffered extraneous output becomes a problem. (Necessitating ob_clean()\nas a further workaround.)\n\nThe buffer is limited in size, and can easily overrun when left to defaults.\nAnd that&apos;s not a rare occurrence either, difficult to track down\nwhen it happens.\n\n\n\n\nBoth approaches therefore may become unreliable - in particular when switching between\ndevelopment setups and/or production servers. This is why output buffering is\nwidely considered just a crutch / strictly a workaround.\nSee also the basic usage example\nin the manual, and for more pros and cons:\n\nWhat is output buffering?\nWhy use output buffering in PHP?\nIs using output buffering considered a bad practice?\nUse case for output buffering as the correct solution to &quot;headers already sent&quot;\n\nBut it worked on the other server!?\nIf you didn&apos;t get the headers warning before, then the output buffering\nphp.ini setting\nhas changed. It&apos;s likely unconfigured on the current/new server.\nChecking with headers_sent()\nYou can always use headers_sent() to probe if\nit&apos;s still possible to... send headers. Which is useful to conditionally print\ninfo or apply other fallback logic.\nif (headers_sent()) {\n    die(&quot;Redirect failed. Please click on this link: &lt;a href=...&gt;&quot;);\n}\nelse{\n    exit(header(&quot;Location: /user.php&quot;));\n}\n\nUseful fallback workarounds are:\n\nHTML &lt;meta&gt; tag\nIf your application is structurally hard to fix, then an easy (but\nsomewhat unprofessional) way to allow redirects is injecting a HTML\n&lt;meta&gt; tag. A redirect can be achieved with:\n &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Location&quot; content=&quot;http://example.com/&quot;&gt;\n\nOr with a short delay:\n &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Refresh&quot; content=&quot;2; url=../target.html&quot;&gt;\n\nThis leads to non-valid HTML when utilized past the &lt;head&gt; section.\nMost browsers still accept it.\n\nJavaScript redirect\nAs alternative a JavaScript redirect\ncan be used for page redirects:\n &lt;script&gt; location.replace(&quot;target.html&quot;); &lt;/script&gt;\n\nWhile this is often more HTML compliant than the &lt;meta&gt; workaround,\nit incurs a reliance on JavaScript-capable clients.\n\n\nBoth approaches however make acceptable fallbacks when genuine HTTP header()\ncalls fail. Ideally you&apos;d always combine this with a user-friendly message and\nclickable link as last resort. (Which for instance is what the http_redirect()\nPECL extension does.)\nWhy setcookie() and session_start() are also affected\nBoth setcookie() and session_start() need to send a Set-Cookie: HTTP header.\nThe same conditions therefore apply, and similar error messages will be generated\nfor premature output situations.\n(Of course, they&apos;re furthermore affected by disabled cookies in the browser\nor even proxy issues. The session functionality obviously also depends on free\ndisk space and other php.ini settings, etc.)\nFurther links\n\nGoogle provides a lengthy list of similar discussions.\nAnd of course many specific cases have been covered on Stack Overflow as well.\nThe WordPress FAQ explains How do I solve the Headers already sent warning problem? in a generic manner.\nAdobe Community: PHP development: why redirects don&apos;t work (headers already sent)\nNucleus FAQ: What does &quot;page headers already sent&quot; mean?\nOne of the more thorough explanations is HTTP Headers and the PHP header() Function - A tutorial by NicholasSolutions (Internet Archive link).\nIt covers HTTP in detail and gives a few guidelines for rewriting scripts.\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"This error message gets triggered when anything is sent before you send HTTP headers (with setcookie or header).

<h2>No output before sending headers!</h2>
<p>Functions that send/modify HTTP headers must be invoked <em><strong>before any output is made</strong></em>.
<kbd><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/8028979/345031"><strong>summary </strong></a></kbd>
Otherwise the call fails:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent (output started at <i>script:line</i>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some functions modifying the HTTP header are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://php.net/header" rel="noreferrer"><code>header</code></a> / <a href="http://php.net/header_remove" rel="noreferrer"><code>header_remove</code></a></li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Unintentional:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Whitespace before <code>&lt;?php</code> or after <code>?&gt;</code></li>
<li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark" rel="noreferrer">UTF-8 Byte Order Mark</a> specifically</li>
<li>Previous error messages or notices</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p><em>Intentional:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><code>print</code>, <code>echo</code> and other functions producing output</li>
<li>Raw <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> sections prior <code>&lt;?php</code> code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why does it happen?</h2>
<p>To understand why headers must be sent before output it's necessary
to look at a typical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" rel="noreferrer">HTTP</a>
response. PHP scripts mainly generate HTML content, but also pass a
set of HTTP/CGI headers to the webserver:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">HTTP/<span class="hljs-number">1.1</span> <span class="hljs-number">200</span> OK
Powered-By: PHP/<span class="hljs-number">5.3</span>.<span class="hljs-number">7</span>
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-<span class="hljs-number">8</span>

&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;PHP page output page&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Content&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some more output follows...&lt;/p&gt;
<span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> &lt;a href=<span class="hljs-string">"/"</span>&gt; &lt;img src=internal-icon-delayed&gt; &lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The page/output always <em>follows</em> the headers. PHP has to pass the
headers to the webserver first. It can only do that once.
After the double linebreak it can nevermore amend them.</p>
<p>When PHP receives the first output (<code>print</code>, <code>echo</code>, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>) it will
<em>flush</em> all collected headers. Afterward it can send all the output
it wants. But sending further HTTP headers is impossible then.</p>
<h2>How can you find out where the premature output occurred?</h2>
<p>The <code>header()</code> warning contains all relevant information to
locate the problem cause:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by
<em><strong>(output started at</strong></em> /www/usr2345/htdocs/<b>auth.php:52</b>) in
/www/usr2345/htdocs/index.php on line 100</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here "line 100" refers to the script where the <code>header()</code> <em>invocation</em> failed.</p>
<p>The "<em>output started at</em>" note within the parenthesis is more significant.
It denominates the source of previous output. In this example, it's <code>auth.php</code>
and <strong>line <code>52</code></strong>. That's where you had to look for premature output.</p>
<p><em>Typical causes:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><h3>Print, echo</h3>
<p>Intentional output from <code>print</code> and <code>echo</code> statements will terminate the opportunity to send HTTP headers. The application flow must be restructured to avoid that. Use <a href="http://php.net/function" rel="noreferrer">functions</a>
and templating schemes. Ensure <code>header()</code> calls occur <em>before</em> messages
are written out.</p>
<p>Functions that produce output include</p>
<ul>
<li><code>print</code>, <code>echo</code>, <code>printf</code>, <code>vprintf</code></li>
<li><code>trigger_error</code>, <code>ob_flush</code>, <code>ob_end_flush</code>, <code>var_dump</code>, <code>print_r</code></li>
<li><code>readfile</code>, <code>passthru</code>, <code>flush</code>, <code>imagepng</code>, <code>imagejpeg</code></li>
</ul>
<p><br> among others and user-defined functions.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>Raw HTML areas</h3>
<p>Unparsed HTML sections in a <code>.php</code> file are direct output as well.
Script conditions that will trigger a <code>header()</code> call must be noted
before <em>any</em> raw <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> blocks.</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
<span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Too late for headers already.</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Use a templating scheme to separate processing from output logic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Place form processing code atop scripts.</li>
<li>Use temporary string variables to defer messages.</li>
<li>The actual output logic and intermixed HTML output should follow last.<br>
<br></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h3>Whitespace before <code>&lt;?php</code> for "script.php <strong>line 1</strong>" warnings</h3>
<p>If the warning refers to output inline <strong><code>1</code></strong>, then it's mostly
leading <strong>whitespace</strong>, text or HTML before the opening <code>&lt;?php</code> token.</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"> <span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># There's a SINGLE space/newline before &lt;? - Which already seals it.</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly it can occur for appended scripts or script sections:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span>

<span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>
</code></pre>
<p>PHP actually eats up a <em>single</em> linebreak after close tags. But it won't
compensate multiple newlines or tabs or spaces shifted into such gaps.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>UTF-8 BOM</h3>
<p>Linebreaks and spaces alone can be a problem. But there are also "invisible"
character sequences that can cause this. Most famously the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark" rel="noreferrer"><strong>UTF-8 BOM</strong> (Byte-Order-Mark)</a>
which isn't displayed by most text editors. It's the byte sequence <code>EF BB BF</code>, which is optional and redundant for UTF-8 encoded documents. PHP however has to treat it as raw output. It may show up as the characters <code>ï»¿</code> in the output (if the client interprets the document as Latin-1) or similar "garbage".</p>
<p>In particular graphical editors and Java-based IDEs are oblivious to its
presence. They don't visualize it (obliged by the Unicode standard).
Most programmer and console editors however do:</p>
<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aXgWY.png" width="590" height="140" alt="joes editor showing UTF-8 BOM placeholder, and MC editor a dot">
<p>There it's easy to recognize the problem early on. Other editors may identify
its presence in a file/settings menu (Notepad++ on Windows can identify and
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3589358/fix-utf8-bom">remedy the problem</a>),
Another option to inspect the BOMs presence is resorting to an <strong>hexeditor</strong>.
On *nix systems <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/hexdump" rel="noreferrer"><code>hexdump</code></a> is usually available,
if not a graphical variant which simplifies auditing these and other issues:</p>
<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QyqUr.png" width="560" height="87" alt="beav hexeditor showing utf-8 bom">
<p>An easy fix is to set the text editor to save files as "UTF-8 (no BOM)"
or similar to such nomenclature. Often newcomers otherwise resort to creating new files and just copy&amp;pasting the previous code back in.</p>
<h3>Correction utilities <img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/wnAS9.gif" width="30" height="20"></h3>
<p>There are also automated tools to examine and rewrite text files
(<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1068650/using-awk-to-remove-the-byte-order-mark"><code>sed</code>/<code>awk</code></a> or <code>recode</code>).
For PHP specifically there's the <a href="http://freshcode.club/projects/phptags" rel="noreferrer"><code>phptags</code> tag tidier</a>.
It rewrites close and open tags into long and short forms, but also easily
fixes leading and trailing whitespace, Unicode and UTF-x BOM issues:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">phptags  --whitespace  *.php
</code></pre>
<p>It's safe to use on a whole include or project directory.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>Whitespace after <code>?&gt;</code></h3>
<p>If the error source is mentioned as behind the
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4410704/php-closing-tag">closing <code>?&gt;</code></a>
then this is where some whitespace or the raw text got written out.
The PHP end marker does not terminate script execution at this point. Any text/space characters after it will be written out as page content
still.</p>
<p>It's commonly advised, in particular to newcomers, that trailing <code>?&gt;</code> PHP
close tags should be omitted. This <em>eschews</em> a small portion of these cases.
(Quite commonly <code>include()d</code> scripts are the culprit.)</p>
</li>
<li><h3>Error source mentioned as "Unknown on line 0"</h3>
<p>It's typically a PHP extension or php.ini setting if no error source
is concretized.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's occasionally the <code>gzip</code> stream encoding setting
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/622192/php-warning-headers-already-sent-in-unknown">or the <code>ob_gzhandler</code></a>.</li>
<li>But it could also be any doubly loaded <code>extension=</code> module
generating an implicit PHP startup/warning message.<br>
<br></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h3>Preceding error messages</h3>
<p>If another PHP statement or expression causes a warning message or
notice being printed out, that also counts as premature output.</p>
<p>In this case you need to eschew the error,
delay the statement execution, or suppress the message with e.g.
<a href="http://php.net/isset" rel="noreferrer"><code>isset()</code></a> or <a href="http://php.net/@" rel="noreferrer"><code>@()</code></a> -
when either doesn't obstruct debugging later on.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>No error message</h2>
<p>If you have <code>error_reporting</code> or <code>display_errors</code> disabled per <code>php.ini</code>,
then no warning will show up. But ignoring errors won't make the problem go
away. Headers still can't be sent after premature output.</p>
<p>So when <code>header("Location: ...")</code> redirects silently fail it's very
advisable to probe for warnings. Reenable them with two simple commands
atop the invocation script:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">error_reporting</span>(E_ALL);
<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">ini_set</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"display_errors"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Or <code>set_error_handler("var_dump");</code> if all else fails.</p>
<p>Speaking of redirect headers, you should often use an idiom like
this for final code paths:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-keyword">exit</span>(<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">header</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Location: /finished.html"</span>));
</code></pre>
<p>Preferably even a utility function, which prints a user message
in case of <code>header()</code> failures.</p>
<h2>Output buffering as a workaround</h2>
<p>PHPs <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.outcontrol.php" rel="noreferrer">output buffering</a>
is a workaround to alleviate this issue. It often works reliably, but shouldn't
substitute for proper application structuring and separating output from control
logic. Its actual purpose is minimizing chunked transfers to the webserver.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/outcontrol.configuration.php" rel="noreferrer"><code>output_buffering=</code></a>
setting nevertheless can help.
Configure it in the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.php" rel="noreferrer">php.ini</a>
or via <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.php" rel="noreferrer">.htaccess</a>
or even <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.per-user.php" rel="noreferrer">.user.ini</a> on
modern FPM/FastCGI setups.<br>
Enabling it will allow PHP to buffer output instead of passing it to the webserver instantly. PHP thus can aggregate HTTP headers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It can likewise be engaged with a call to <a href="http://php.net/ob_start" rel="noreferrer"><code>ob_start();</code></a>
atop the invocation script. Which however is less reliable for multiple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Even if <code>&lt;?php ob_start(); ?&gt;</code> starts the first script, whitespace or a
BOM might get shuffled before, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2168956/php-header-problem-even-i-use-ob-start-and-ob-end-flush">rendering it ineffective</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It can conceal whitespace for HTML output. But as soon as the application logic attempts to send binary content (a generated image for example),
the buffered extraneous output becomes a problem. (Necessitating <code>ob_clean()</code>
as a further workaround.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The buffer is limited in size, and can easily overrun when left to defaults.
And that's not a rare occurrence either, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17643837/php-headers-already-sent-error-depending-on-output-length">difficult to track down</a>
when it happens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both approaches therefore may become unreliable - in particular when switching between
development setups and/or production servers. This is why output buffering is
widely considered just a crutch / strictly a workaround.</p>

</ul>
<h3>But it worked on the other server!?</h3>
<p>If you didn't get the headers warning before, then the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/outcontrol.configuration.php" rel="noreferrer">output buffering
php.ini setting</a>
has changed. It's likely unconfigured on the current/new server.</p>
<h2>Checking with <code>headers_sent()</code></h2>
<p>You can always use <a href="http://php.net/headers_sent" rel="noreferrer"><code>headers_sent()</code></a> to probe if
it's still possible to... send headers. Which is useful to conditionally print
info or apply other fallback logic.</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">headers_sent</span>()) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">die</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Redirect failed. Please click on this link: &lt;a href=...&gt;"</span>);
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">exit</span>(<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">header</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Location: /user.php"</span>));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Useful fallback workarounds are:</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>HTML <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag</h3>
<p>If your application is structurally hard to fix, then an easy (but
somewhat unprofessional) way to allow redirects is injecting a HTML
<code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag. A redirect can be achieved with:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"> &lt;meta http-equiv=<span class="hljs-string">"Location"</span> content=<span class="hljs-string">"http://example.com/"</span>&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Or with a short delay:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"> &lt;meta http-equiv=<span class="hljs-string">"Refresh"</span> content=<span class="hljs-string">"2; url=../target.html"</span>&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This leads to non-valid HTML when utilized past the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section.
Most browsers still accept it.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>JavaScript redirect</h3>
<p>As alternative a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/503093/how-can-i-make-a-redirect-page-in-jquery-javascript">JavaScript redirect</a>
can be used for page redirects:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"> &lt;script&gt; location.<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"target.html"</span>); &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>While this is often more HTML compliant than the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> workaround,
it incurs a reliance on JavaScript-capable clients.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both approaches however make acceptable fallbacks when genuine HTTP header()
calls fail. Ideally you'd always combine this with a user-friendly message and
clickable link as last resort. (Which for instance is what the <a href="https://php.uz/manual/en/function.http-redirect.php" rel="noreferrer">http_redirect()</a>
PECL extension does.)</p>
<h2>Why <code>setcookie()</code> and <code>session_start()</code> are also affected</h2>
<p>Both <code>setcookie()</code> and <code>session_start()</code> need to send a <code>Set-Cookie:</code> HTTP header.
The same conditions therefore apply, and similar error messages will be generated
for premature output situations.</p>
<p>(Of course, they're furthermore affected by disabled cookies in the browser
or even proxy issues. The session functionality obviously also depends on free
disk space and other php.ini settings, etc.)</p>

<p>This error message gets triggered when <em>anything</em> is sent before you send HTTP headers (with <a href="http://php.net/setcookie" rel="noreferrer"><code>setcookie</code></a> or <a href="http://php.net/header" rel="noreferrer"><code>header</code></a>). Common reasons for outputting something before the HTTP headers are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Accidental whitespace, often at the beginning or end of files, like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"> <span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// Note the space before "&lt;?php"</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To avoid this, simply leave out the closing <code>?&gt;</code> - it's not required anyways.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark" rel="noreferrer">Byte order marks</a> at the beginning of a php file. Examine your php files with a hex editor to find out whether that's the case. They should start with the bytes <code>3F 3C</code>. You can safely remove the BOM <code>EF BB BF</code> from the start of files.</li>
<li>Explicit output, such as calls to <code>echo</code>, <code>printf</code>, <code>readfile</code>, <code>passthru</code>, code before <code>&lt;?</code> etc.</li>
<li>A warning outputted by php, if the <a href="http://php.net/display-errors" rel="noreferrer"><code>display_errors</code></a> php.ini property is set. Instead of crashing on a programmer mistake, php silently fixes the error and emits a warning. While you can modify the <a href="http://php.net/display-errors" rel="noreferrer"><code>display_errors</code></a> or <a href="http://php.net/error-reporting" rel="noreferrer">error_reporting</a> configurations, you should rather fix the problem.<br>
Common reasons are accesses to undefined elements of an array (such as <code>$_POST['input']</code> without using <a href="http://php.net/empty" rel="noreferrer"><code>empty</code></a> or <a href="http://php.net/isset" rel="noreferrer"><code>isset</code></a> to test whether the input is set), or using an undefined constant instead of a string literal (as in <code>$_POST[input]</code>, note the missing quotes).</li>
</ul>

<p>Turning on <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.outcontrol.php" rel="noreferrer">output buffering</a> should make the problem go away; all output after the call to <a href="http://php.net/ob_start" rel="noreferrer"><code>ob_start</code></a> is buffered in memory until you release the buffer, e.g. with <a href="http://php.net/ob_end_flush" rel="noreferrer"><code>ob_end_flush</code></a>.</p>

<p>However, while output buffering avoids the issues, you should really determine why your application outputs an HTTP body before the HTTP header. That'd be like taking a phone call and discussing your day and the weather before telling the caller that he's got the wrong number.</p>

<p>I got this error many times before, and I am certain all PHP programmer got this error at least once before.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Solution 1</strong></p>

<p>This error may have been caused by the blank spaces <em>before</em> the start of the file or <em>after</em> the end of the file.These blank spaces should not be here.</p>

<p>ex)
    THERE SHOULD BE NO BLANK SPACES HERE
    

</p><pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">   <span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-string">"your code here"</span>;

<span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span>
THERE SHOULD BE NO BLANK SPACES HERE
</code></pre>

<p>Check all files associated with file that causes this error. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Sometimes EDITOR(IDE) like gedit (a default linux editor) add one blank line on save file. This should not happen. If you are using Linux. you can use VI editor to remove space/lines after ?&gt; at the end of the page.</em></p>

<p><strong>Possible Solution 2:</strong>
If this is not your case, then use <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.ob-start.php" rel="noreferrer">ob_start</a> to output buffering:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>
  <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">ob_start</span>();

  <span class="hljs-comment">// code </span>

 <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">ob_end_flush</span>();
<span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span> 
</code></pre>

<p>This will turn output buffering on and your headers will be created after the page is buffered.</p>

<p>It'll definitely solve your problem.
I faced the same problem but I solved through writing header location in the above way.</p>

<h1>COMMON PROBLEMS:</h1>

<p>(copied from: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/24928578/2377343">source</a>)</p>

<p>====================</p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> there should not be any output (i.e. <strong><code>echo..</code></strong> or HTML codes) before the <strong><code>header(.......);</code></strong> command.</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> remove any <strong>white-space</strong>(or <strong>newline</strong>) before <code>&lt;?php</code> and after <code>?&gt;</code> tags.</p>

<p><strong>3)</strong>  <strong>GOLDEN RULE!</strong> - check if that php file (and also, if you <code>include</code> other files) have <strong>UTF8 without BOM</strong> encoding (and not just <strong>UTF-8</strong>). That is problem in many cases (because <strong>UTF8</strong> encoded file has something special character in the start of php file, which your text-editor doesnt show)!!!!!!!!!!! </p>

<p><strong>4)</strong> After <code>header(...);</code> you must use <code>exit;</code>  </p>

<p><strong>5)</strong>  always use 301 or 302 reference:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">header</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"location: http://example.com"</span>,  <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,  <span class="hljs-number">301</span> );  <span class="hljs-keyword">exit</span>;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>6)</strong> <strong>Turn on error reporting, and find the error.</strong>  Your error may be caused by a function that is not working. When you turn on error reporting, you should always fix top-most error first. For example, it might be "Warning: date_default_timezone_get(): It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings." - then farther on down you may see "headers not sent" error. After fixing top-most (1st) error, re-load your page. If you still have errors, then again fix the top-most error.</p>

<p><strong>7)</strong> If none of above helps, use JAVSCRIPT redirection(however, strongly non-recommended method), may be the last chance in custom cases...: </p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-string">"&lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;window.top.location='http://website.com/';&lt;/script&gt;"</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">exit</span>;
</code></pre>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution7" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl border p-10 shadow-md w-9/12 bg-white"><h4 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 7</h4><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>It is because of this line:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">printf</span> (<span class="hljs-string">"Hi %s,&lt;/br /&gt;"</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$name</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>You should not <strong><em>print/echo</em></strong> anything before sending the headers.</p>

<p>A simple tip: A simple space (or invisible special char) in your script, right before the very first <code>&lt;?php</code> tag, can cause this !
Especially when you are working in a team and somebody is using a "weak" IDE or has messed around in the files with strange text editors.</p>

<p>I have seen these things ;)</p>

<p>Another bad practice can invoke this problem which is not stated yet.</p>

<p>See this code snippet:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">include</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'a_important_file.php'</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">//really really really bad practise</span>
<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">header</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Location:A location"</span>);
<span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Things are okay,right?</p>

<p>What if "a_important_file.php" is this:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">//some php code </span>
<span class="hljs-comment">//another line of php code</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">//no line above is generating any output</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span>

 ----------This is the end of the an_important_file-------------------
</code></pre>

<p>This will not work? Why?Because already a new line is generated.</p>

<p>Now,though this is not a common scenario what if you are using a MVC framework which loads a lots of file before handover things to your controller? This is not an uncommon scenario. Be prepare for this.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/">PSR-2 2.2 :</a></p>

<ul>
<li><em><strong>All PHP files MUST use the <code>Unix LF (linefeed) line ending</code>.</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>All PHP files MUST end with a <code>single blank line</code>.</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>The closing ?&gt; tag MUST be <code>omitted</code> from files containing <code>only php</code></strong></em></li>

<p>Sometimes when the dev process has both WIN work stations and LINUX systems (hosting) and in the code you do not see any output before the related line, it could be the formatting of the file and the lack of <em>Unix LF (linefeed)</em> 
 line ending. </p>

<p>What we usually do in order to quickly fix this, is rename the file and on the LINUX system create a new file instead of the renamed one, and then copy the content into that. Many times this solve the issue as some of the files that were created in WIN once moved to the hosting cause this issue.</p>

<p>This fix is an easy fix for sites we manage by FTP and sometimes can save our new team members some time.</p>

<p>Generally this error arise when we send header after echoing or printing. If this error arise on a specific page then make sure that page is not echoing anything before calling to <code>start_session()</code>.</p>

<p>Example of Unpredictable Error:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"> <span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span> <span class="hljs-comment">//a white-space before &lt;?php also send for output and arise error</span>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>
includes <span class="hljs-string">'functions.php'</span>;
<span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span> &lt;!-- This <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> line will also arise error --&gt;
