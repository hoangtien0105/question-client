<p>My crystal ball says that you are loading the model using either <code>file://</code> or <code>C:/</code>, which stays true to the error message as they are not <code>http://</code></p>
<p>So you can either install a webserver in your local PC or upload the model somewhere else and use <code>jsonp</code> and change the url to <code>http://example.com/path/to/model</code></p>
<p>Origin is defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6454" rel="noreferrer">RFC-6454</a> as</p>

</code></pre>
<p>So even though your file originates from the same host (<code>localhost</code>), but as long as the scheme is different (<code>http</code> / <code>file</code>), they are treated as different origin.</p>

<p>Just to be explicit - Yes, the error is saying you cannot point your browser directly at <code>file://some/path/some.html</code></p>

<p>Here are some options to quickly spin up a local web server to let your browser render local files</p>

<h2>Python 2</h2>

<p>If you have Python installed...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change directory into the folder where your file <code>some.html</code> or file(s) exist using the command <code>cd /path/to/your/folder</code></p></li>
<li><p>Start up a Python web server using the command <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>This will start a web server to host your entire directory listing at <code>http://localhost:8000</code></p>

<ol start="3">
<li>You can use a custom port  <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000</code> giving you link: <code>http://localhost:9000</code></li>
</ol>

<p>This approach is built in to any Python installation.</p>

<h2>Python 3</h2>

<p>Do the same steps, but use the following command instead <code>python3 -m http.server</code></p>

<h2>Node.js</h2>

<p>Alternatively, if you demand a more responsive setup and already use nodejs...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Install <code>http-server</code> by typing <code>npm install -g http-server</code></p></li>
<li><p>Change into your working directory, where your<code>some.html</code> lives </p></li>
<li><p>Start your http server by issuing <code>http-server -c-1</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>This spins up a Node.js httpd which serves the files in your directory as static files accessible from <code>http://localhost:8080</code></p>

<h2>Ruby</h2>

<p>If your preferred language is Ruby ... the Ruby Gods say this works as well:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">ruby -run -e httpd . -p <span class="hljs-number">8080</span>
</code></pre>

<h2>PHP</h2>

<p>Of course PHP also has its solution.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">php -S <span class="hljs-attr">localhost</span>:<span class="hljs-number">8000</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In Chrome you can use this flag:</p>

<p>Ran in to this today.</p>

<p>I wrote some code that looked like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">app.<span class="hljs-title function_">controller</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'ctrlr'</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">$scope, $http</span>){
    $http.<span class="hljs-title function_">get</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'localhost:3000'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">success</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">data</span>) {
        $scope.<span class="hljs-property">stuff</span> = data;
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>...but it should've looked like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">app.<span class="hljs-title function_">controller</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'ctrlr'</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">$scope, $http</span>){
    $http.<span class="hljs-title function_">get</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'http://localhost:3000'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">success</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">data</span>) {
        $scope.<span class="hljs-property">stuff</span> = data;
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>The only difference was the lack of <code>http://</code> in the second snippet of code.</p>

<p>Just wanted to put that out there in case there are others with a similar issue.</p>

<p>Just change the url to <code>http://localhost</code> instead of <code>localhost</code>.

<p>I'm going to list <strong>3 different approaches</strong> to solve this issue:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Using a very lightweight <code>npm</code> package</strong>: Install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server" rel="noreferrer">live-server</a> using <code>npm install -g live-server</code>. Then, go to that directory open the terminal and type <code>live-server</code> and hit enter, page will be served at <code>localhost:8080</code>. BONUS: It also supports hot reloading by default.</li>
<li><strong>Using a lightweight Google Chrome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en" rel="noreferrer">app</a> developed by Google</strong>: Install the app, then go to the apps tab in Chrome and open the app. In the app point it to the right folder. Your page will be served!</li>
<li><strong>Modifying Chrome shortcut in windows</strong>: Create a Chrome browser's shortcut. Right-click on the icon and open properties. In properties, edit <code>target</code> to <code>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --disable-web-security --user-data-dir="C:/ChromeDevSession"</code> and save. Then using Chrome open the page using <code>ctrl+o</code>. NOTE: Do <strong>NOT</strong> use this shortcut for regular browsing.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Use <code>http://</code> like <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in case you face error.</p>

<p>fastest way for me was:
for windows users run your file on Firefox problem solved, or

<p>For those on Windows without Python or Node.js, there is still a lightweight solution: <strong><a href="http://cesanta.com/mongoose.shtml" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mongoose</a></strong>.</p>
<p>All you do is drag the executable to wherever the root of the server should be, and run it. An icon will appear in the taskbar and it'll navigate to the server in the default browser.</p>
<p>Also, <a href="http://zwamp.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Z-WAMP</a> is a 100% portable WAMP that runs in a single folder, it's awesome.

<p>This method is very barebones, it cannot show directories or other fancy stuff. But it handles these CORS errors just fine.</p>
<p>Save the script as <code>server.ps1</code> and run in the root of your project. It will launch index.html in the directory it is placed in.</p>

<p><strong>Easy solution for whom using VS Code</strong></p>

<p>I've been getting this error for a while. Most of the answers works. But I found a different solution. If you don't want to deal with <code>node.js</code> or any other solution in here and you are working with an HTML file (calling functions from another js file or fetch json api's) try to use <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer" rel="noreferrer">Live Server</a> extension. </p>

<p>It allows you to open a live server easily. And because of it creates <code>localhost</code> server, the problem is resolving. You can simply start the <code>localhost</code> by open a HTML file and right-click on the editor and click on <code>Open with Live Server</code>.</p>

<p>It basically load the files using <code>http://localhost/index.html</code> instead of using <code>file://...</code>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>It is not necessary to have a <code>.html</code> file. You can start the Live Server with shortcuts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hit <code>(alt+L, alt+O)</code> to Open the Server and <code>(alt+L, alt+C)</code> to Stop the server. [On MAC, <code>cmd+L, cmd+O</code> and <code>cmd+L, cmd+C</code>]</p>

<p>Hope it will help someone :) </p>

<p>If you insist on running the <code>.html</code> file locally and not serving it with a webserver, you can prevent those cross origin requests from happening in the first place by making the problematic resources available inline.</p>

<p>I had this problem when trying to to serve <code>.js</code> files through <code>file://</code>. My solution was to update my build script to replace <code>&lt;script src="..."&gt;</code> tags with <code>&lt;script&gt;...&lt;/script&gt;</code>.
Here's a <code>gulp</code> approach for doing that:</p>

<p>1.
run <code>npm install --save-dev</code> to packages <code>gulp</code>, <code>gulp-inline</code> and <code>del</code>.</p>

<p>One way it worked loading local files is using them with in the project folder instead of outside your project folder. Create one folder under your project example files similar to the way we create for images and replace the section where using complete local path other than project path and use relative url of file under project folder .
It worked for me </p>

<p>cordova achieve this. I still can not figure out how cordova did. It does not even go through  shouldInterceptRequest.</p>

<p>Later I found out that the key to load any file from local is: myWebView.getSettings().setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs(true);</p>

<p>And when you want to access any http resource, the webview will do checking with OPTIONS method, which you can grant the access through WebViewClient.shouldInterceptRequest by return a response, and for the following GET/POST method, you can just return null.</p>
