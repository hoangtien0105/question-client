An Array is a special form of object.\n\n(Plain) Objects have the form\n\n{key: value, key: value, ...}\n\n\nArrays have the form\n\n[value, value, ...]\n\n\nBoth arrays and objects expose a key -&gt; value structure. Keys in an array must be numeric, whereas any string can be used as key in objects. The key-value pairs are also called the &quot;properties&quot;.\n\nProperties can be accessed either using dot notation\n\nconst value = obj.someProperty;\n\n\nor bracket notation, if the property name would not be a valid JavaScript identifier name [spec], or the name is the value of a variable:\n\n// the space is not a valid character in identifier names\nconst value = obj[&quot;some Property&quot;];\n\n// property name as variable\nconst name = &quot;some Property&quot;;\nconst value = obj[name];\n\n\nFor that reason, array elements can only be accessed using bracket notation:\n\nconst value = arr[5]; // arr.5 would be a syntax error\n\n// property name / index as variable\nconst x = 5;\nconst value = arr[x];\n\n\nWait... what about JSON?\n\nJSON is a textual representation of data, just like XML, YAML, CSV, and others. To work with such data, it first has to be converted to JavaScript data types, i.e. arrays and objects (and how to work with those was just explained). How to parse JSON is explained in the question Parse JSON in JavaScript? .\n\nFurther reading material\n\nHow to access arrays and objects is fundamental JavaScript knowledge and therefore it is advisable to read the MDN JavaScript Guide, especially the sections\n\n\nWorking with Objects\nArrays\nEloquent JavaScript - Data Structures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing nested data structures\n\nA nested data structure is an array or object which refers to other arrays or objects, i.e. its values are arrays or objects. Such structures can be accessed by consecutively applying dot or bracket notation. \n\nHere is an example:\n\nconst data = {\n    code: 42,\n    items: [{\n        id: 1,\n        name: &apos;foo&apos;\n    }, {\n        id: 2,\n        name: &apos;bar&apos;\n    }]\n};\n\n\nLet&apos;s assume we want to access the name of the second item. \n\nHere is how we can do it step-by-step:\n\nAs we can see data is an object, hence we can access its properties using dot notation. The items property is accessed as follows:\n\ndata.items\n\n\nThe value is an array, to access its second element, we have to use bracket notation:\n\ndata.items[1]\n\n\nThis value is an object and we use dot notation again to access the name property. So we eventually get:\n\nconst item_name = data.items[1].name;\n\n\nAlternatively, we could have used bracket notation for any of the properties, especially if the name contained characters that would have made it invalid for dot notation usage:\n\nconst item_name = data[&apos;items&apos;][1][&apos;name&apos;];\n\n\n\n\nI&apos;m trying to access a property but I get only undefined back?\n\nMost of the time when you are getting undefined, the object/array simply doesn&apos;t have a property with that name.\n\nconst foo = {bar: {baz: 42}};\nconsole.log(foo.baz); // undefined\n\n\nUse console.log or console.dir and inspect the structure of object / array. The property you are trying to access might be actually defined on a nested object / array.\n\nconsole.log(foo.bar.baz); // 42\n\n\n\n\nWhat if the property names are dynamic and I don&apos;t know them beforehand?\n\nIf the property names are unknown or we want to access all properties of an object / elements of an array, we can use the for...in [MDN] loop for objects and the for [MDN] loop for arrays to iterate over all properties / elements.\n\nObjects\n\nTo iterate over all properties of data, we can iterate over the object like so:\n\nfor (const prop in data) {\n    // `prop` contains the name of each property, i.e. `&apos;code&apos;` or `&apos;items&apos;`\n    // consequently, `data[prop]` refers to the value of each property, i.e.\n    // either `42` or the array\n}\n\n\nDepending on where the object comes from (and what you want to do), you might have to test in each iteration whether the property is really a property of the object, or it is an inherited property. You can do this with Object#hasOwnProperty [MDN].\n\nAs alternative to for...in with hasOwnProperty, you can use Object.keys [MDN] to get an array of property names:\n\nObject.keys(data).forEach(function(prop) {\n  // `prop` is the property name\n  // `data[prop]` is the property value\n});\n\n\nArrays\n\nTo iterate over all elements of the data.items array, we use a for loop:\n\nfor(let i = 0, l = data.items.length; i &lt; l; i++) {\n    // `i` will take on the values `0`, `1`, `2`,..., i.e. in each iteration\n    // we can access the next element in the array with `data.items[i]`, example:\n    // \n    // var obj = data.items[i];\n    // \n    // Since each element is an object (in our example),\n    // we can now access the objects properties with `obj.id` and `obj.name`. \n    // We could also use `data.items[i].id`.\n}\n\n\nOne could also use for...in to iterate over arrays, but there are reasons why this should be avoided: Why is &apos;for(var item in list)&apos; with arrays considered bad practice in JavaScript?.\n\nWith the increasing browser support of ECMAScript 5, the array method forEach [MDN] becomes an interesting alternative as well:\n\ndata.items.forEach(function(value, index, array) {\n    // The callback is executed for each element in the array.\n    // `value` is the element itself (equivalent to `array[index]`)\n    // `index` will be the index of the element in the array\n    // `array` is a reference to the array itself (i.e. `data.items` in this case)\n}); \n\n\nIn environments supporting ES2015 (ES6), you can also use the for...of [MDN] loop, which not only works for arrays, but for any iterable:\n\nfor (const item of data.items) {\n   // `item` is the array element, **not** the index\n}\n\n\nIn each iteration, for...of directly gives us the next element of the iterable, there is no &quot;index&quot; to access or use.\n\n\n\nWhat if the &quot;depth&quot; of the data structure is unknown to me?\n\nIn addition to unknown keys, the &quot;depth&quot; of the data structure (i.e. how many nested objects) it has, might be unknown as well. How to access deeply nested properties usually depends on the exact data structure.\n\nBut if the data structure contains repeating patterns, e.g. the representation of a binary tree, the solution typically includes to recursively [Wikipedia] access each level of the data structure.\n\nHere is an example to get the first leaf node of a binary tree:\n\nfunction getLeaf(node) {\n    if (node.leftChild) {\n        return getLeaf(node.leftChild); // &lt;- recursive call\n    }\n    else if (node.rightChild) {\n        return getLeaf(node.rightChild); // &lt;- recursive call\n    }\n    else { // node must be a leaf node\n        return node;\n    }\n}\n\nconst first_leaf = getLeaf(root);\n\n\nShow code snippet\n\nconst root = {\n    leftChild: {\n        leftChild: {\n            leftChild: null,\n            rightChild: null,\n            data: 42\n        },\n        rightChild: {\n            leftChild: null,\n            rightChild: null,\n            data: 5\n        }\n    },\n    rightChild: {\n        leftChild: {\n            leftChild: null,\n            rightChild: null,\n            data: 6\n        },\n        rightChild: {\n            leftChild: null,\n            rightChild: null,\n            data: 7\n        }\n    }\n};\nfunction getLeaf(node) {\n    if (node.leftChild) {\n        return getLeaf(node.leftChild);\n    } else if (node.rightChild) {\n        return getLeaf(node.rightChild);\n    } else { // node must be a leaf node\n        return node;\n    }\n}\n\nconsole.log(getLeaf(root).data);\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\nA more generic way to access a nested data structure with unknown keys and depth is to test the type of the value and act accordingly.\n\nHere is an example which adds all primitive values inside a nested data structure into an array (assuming it does not contain any functions). If we encounter an object (or array) we simply call toArray again on that value (recursive call).\n\nfunction toArray(obj) {\n    const result = [];\n    for (const prop in obj) {\n        const value = obj[prop];\n        if (typeof value === &apos;object&apos;) {\n            result.push(toArray(value)); // &lt;- recursive call\n        }\n        else {\n            result.push(value);\n        }\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\n\nShow code snippet\n\nconst data = {\n  code: 42,\n  items: [{\n    id: 1,\n    name: &apos;foo&apos;\n  }, {\n    id: 2,\n    name: &apos;bar&apos;\n  }]\n};\n\n\nfunction toArray(obj) {\n  const result = [];\n  for (const prop in obj) {\n    const value = obj[prop];\n    if (typeof value === &apos;object&apos;) {\n      result.push(toArray(value));\n    } else {\n      result.push(value);\n    }\n  }\n  return result;\n}\n\nconsole.log(toArray(data));\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelpers\n\nSince the structure of a complex object or array is not necessarily obvious, we can inspect the value at each step to decide how to move further. console.log [MDN] and console.dir [MDN] help us doing this. For example (output of the Chrome console):\n\n&gt; console.log(data.items)\n [ Object, Object ]\n\n\nHere we see that that data.items is an array with two elements which are both objects. In Chrome console the objects can even be expanded and inspected immediately.\n\n&gt; console.log(data.items[1])\n  Object\n     id: 2\n     name: &quot;bar&quot;\n     __proto__: Object\n\n\nThis tells us that data.items[1] is an object, and after expanding it we see that it has three properties, id, name and __proto__. The latter is an internal property used for the prototype chain of the object. The prototype chain and inheritance is out of scope for this answer, though.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You can access it this way\n\ndata.items[1].name\n\n\nor\n\ndata[&quot;items&quot;][1][&quot;name&quot;]\n\n\nBoth ways are equal.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Objects and arrays has a lot of built-in methods that can help you with processing data.\n\nNote: in many of the examples I&apos;m using arrow functions.

The syntax is for (const element of array) (we can replace const with var or let, but it&apos;s better to use const if we don&apos;t intend to modify element).\n\nDestructuring assignment lets you extract values from an array or an object and assign them to variables. In this case const [key, value] means that instead of assigning the [key, value] array to element, we assign the first element of that array to key and the second element to value. It is equivalent to this:\n\nfor (const element of Object.entries(obj)) {\n  const key = element[0]\n       ,value = element[1]\n}\n\n\nAs you can see, destructuring makes this a lot simpler.\n\nArray.prototype.every() and Array.prototype.some()\n\nThe every() method returns true if the specified callback function returns true for every element of the array. The some() method returns true if the specified callback function returns true for some (at least one) element.\n\n\n\nconst arr = [1, 2, 3]\n\n// true, because every element is greater than 0\nconsole.log(arr.every(x =&gt; x &gt; 0))\n// false, because 3^2 is greater than 5\nconsole.log(arr.every(x =&gt; Math.pow(x, 2) &lt; 5))\n// true, because 2 is even (the remainder from dividing by 2 is 0)\nconsole.log(arr.some(x =&gt; x % 2 === 0))\n// false, because none of the elements is equal to 5\nconsole.log(arr.some(x =&gt; x === 5))\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\nArray.prototype.find() and Array.prototype.filter()\n\nThe find() methods returns the first element which satisfies the provided callback function.

The simple approach is the first level, for example\n\nvar obj = { hello: &quot;world&quot; };\nvar key = &quot;hello&quot;;\nalert(obj[key]);//world\n\n\nBut this is often not the case with complex json. As json becomes more complex, the approaches for finding values inside of the json also become complex. A recursive approach for navigating the json is best, and how that recursion is leveraged will depend on the type of data being searched for. If there are conditional statements involved, a json search can be a good tool to use.\n\nIf the property being accessed is already known, but the path is complex, for example in this object\n\nvar obj = {\n arr: [\n    { id: 1, name: &quot;larry&quot; },    \n    { id: 2, name: &quot;curly&quot; },\n    { id: 3, name: &quot;moe&quot; }\n ]\n};\n\n\nAnd you know you want to get the first result of the array in the object, perhaps you would like to use\n\nvar moe = obj[&quot;arr[0].name&quot;];\n\n\nHowever, that will cause an exception as there is no property of object with that name. The solution to be able to use this would be to flatten the tree aspect of the object. This can be done recursively.\n\nfunction flatten(obj){\n var root = {};\n (function tree(obj, index){\n   var suffix = toString.call(obj) == &quot;[object Array]&quot; ? &quot;]&quot; : &quot;&quot;;\n   for(var key in obj){\n    if(!obj.hasOwnProperty(key))continue;\n    root[index+key+suffix] = obj[key];\n    if( toString.call(obj[key]) == &quot;[object Array]&quot; )tree(obj[key],index+key+suffix+&quot;[&quot;);\n    if( toString.call(obj[key]) == &quot;[object Object]&quot; )tree(obj[key],index+key+suffix+&quot;.&quot;);   \n   }\n })(obj,&quot;&quot;);\n return root;\n}\n\n\nNow, the complex object can be flattened\n\nvar obj = previous definition;\nvar flat = flatten(obj);\nvar moe = flat[&quot;arr[0].name&quot;];//moe\n\n\nHere is a jsFiddle Demo of this approach being used.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"To access a nested attribute, you need to specify its name and then search through the object.\n\nIf you already know the exact path, then you can hardcode it in your script like so:\n\ndata[&apos;items&apos;][1][&apos;name&apos;]\n\n\nthese also work -\n\ndata.items[1].name\ndata[&apos;items&apos;][1].name\ndata.items[1][&apos;name&apos;]\n\n\nWhen you don&apos;t know the exact name before hand, or a user is the one who provides the name for you.

<h2>Preliminaries</h2>

<p>JavaScript has only one data type which can contain multiple values: <strong>Object</strong>. An <strong>Array</strong> is a special form of object.</p>

<p>(Plain) Objects have the form</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">{<span class="hljs-attr">key</span>: value, <span class="hljs-attr">key</span>: value, ...}
</code></pre>

<p>Arrays have the form</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">[value, value, ...]
</code></pre>

<p>Both arrays and objects expose a <code>key -&gt; value</code> structure. Keys in an array must be numeric, whereas any string can be used as key in objects. The key-value pairs are also called the <strong>"properties"</strong>.</p>

<p>Properties can be accessed either using <strong>dot notation</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> value = obj.<span class="hljs-property">someProperty</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>or <strong>bracket notation</strong>, if the property name would not be a valid JavaScript <a href="http://es5.github.com/#x7.6" rel="noreferrer">identifier name <em><sup>[spec]</sup></em></a>, or the name is the value of a variable:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// the space is not a valid character in identifier names</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> value = obj[<span class="hljs-string">"some Property"</span>];

<span class="hljs-comment">// property name as variable</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> name = <span class="hljs-string">"some Property"</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> value = obj[name];
</code></pre>

<p>For that reason, array elements can only be accessed using bracket notation:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> value = arr[<span class="hljs-number">5</span>]; <span class="hljs-comment">// arr.5 would be a syntax error</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">// property name / index as variable</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> x = <span class="hljs-number">5</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> value = arr[x];
</code></pre>

<h3>Wait... what about JSON?</h3>

<p>JSON is a textual representation of data, just like XML, YAML, CSV, and others. To work with such data, it first has to be converted to JavaScript data types, i.e. arrays and objects (and how to work with those was just explained). How to parse JSON is explained in the question <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4935632/how-to-parse-json-in-javascript">Parse JSON in JavaScript?</a> .</p>

<h3>Further reading material</h3>

<p>How to access arrays and objects is fundamental JavaScript knowledge and therefore it is advisable to read the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide" rel="noreferrer">MDN JavaScript Guide</a>, especially the sections</p>

<ul>

<h2>Accessing nested data structures</h2>

<p>A nested data structure is an array or object which refers to other arrays or objects, i.e. its values are arrays or objects. Such structures can be accessed by consecutively applying dot or bracket notation. </p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> data = {
    <span class="hljs-attr">code</span>: <span class="hljs-number">42</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attr">items</span>: [{
        <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>,
        <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>
    }, {
        <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>: <span class="hljs-number">2</span>,
        <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'bar'</span>
    }]
};
</code></pre>

<p>Let's assume we want to access the <code>name</code> of the second item. </p>

<p>Here is how we can do it step-by-step:</p>

<p>As we can see <code>data</code> is an object, hence we can access its properties using dot notation. The <code>items</code> property is accessed as follows:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">data.<span class="hljs-property">items</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The value is an array, to access its second element, we have to use bracket notation:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">data.<span class="hljs-property">items</span>[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]
</code></pre>

<p>This value is an object and we use dot notation again to access the <code>name</code> property. So we eventually get:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> item_name = data.<span class="hljs-property">items</span>[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>].<span class="hljs-property">name</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, we could have used bracket notation for any of the properties, especially if the name contained characters that would have made it invalid for dot notation usage:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> item_name = data[<span class="hljs-string">'items'</span>][<span class="hljs-number">1</span>][<span class="hljs-string">'name'</span>];
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3>I'm trying to access a property but I get only <code>undefined</code> back?</h3>

<p>Most of the time when you are getting <code>undefined</code>, the object/array simply doesn't have a property with that name.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> foo = {<span class="hljs-attr">bar</span>: {<span class="hljs-attr">baz</span>: <span class="hljs-number">42</span>}};
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(foo.<span class="hljs-property">baz</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// undefined</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/console.log" rel="noreferrer"><code>console.log</code></a> or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/console.dir" rel="noreferrer"><code>console.dir</code></a> and inspect the structure of object / array. The property you are trying to access might be actually defined on a nested object / array.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(foo.<span class="hljs-property">bar</span>.<span class="hljs-property">baz</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// 42</span>
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h3>What if the property names are dynamic and I don't know them beforehand?</h3>

<p>If the property names are unknown or we want to access all properties of an object / elements of an array, we can use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in" rel="noreferrer"><code>for...in</code> <em><sup>[MDN]</sup></em></a> loop for objects and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for" rel="noreferrer"><code>for</code> <em><sup>[MDN]</sup></em></a> loop for arrays to iterate over all properties / elements.</p>

<p><strong>Objects</strong></p>

<p>To iterate over all properties of <code>data</code>, we can iterate over the <strong>object</strong> like so:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> prop <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> data) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// `prop` contains the name of each property, i.e. `'code'` or `'items'`</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// consequently, `data[prop]` refers to the value of each property, i.e.</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// either `42` or the array</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>Depending on where the object comes from (and what you want to do), you might have to test in each iteration whether the property is really a property of the object, or it is an inherited property. You can do this with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty" rel="noreferrer"><code>Object#hasOwnProperty</code> <em><sup>[MDN]</sup></em></a>.</p>

<p>As alternative to <code>for...in</code> with <code>hasOwnProperty</code>, you can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys" rel="noreferrer"><code>Object.keys</code> <em><sup>[MDN]</sup></em></a> to get an <em>array of property names</em>:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title class_">Object</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">keys</span>(data).<span class="hljs-title function_">forEach</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">prop</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-comment">// `prop` is the property name</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">// `data[prop]` is the property value</span>
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Arrays</strong></p>

<p>To iterate over all elements of the <code>data.items</code> <strong>array</strong>, we use a <code>for</code> loop:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, l = data.<span class="hljs-property">items</span>.<span class="hljs-property">length</span>; i &lt; l; i++) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// `i` will take on the values `0`, `1`, `2`,..., i.e. in each iteration</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// we can access the next element in the array with `data.items[i]`, example:</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// </span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// var obj = data.items[i];</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// </span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Since each element is an object (in our example),</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// we can now access the objects properties with `obj.id` and `obj.name`. </span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// We could also use `data.items[i].id`.</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>One could also use <code>for...in</code> to iterate over arrays, but there are reasons why this should be avoided: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2265167/why-is-forvar-item-in-list-with-arrays-considered-bad-practice-in-javascript">Why is 'for(var item in list)' with arrays considered bad practice in JavaScript?</a>.</p>

<p>With the increasing browser support of ECMAScript 5, the array method <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach" rel="noreferrer"><code>forEach</code> <em><sup>[MDN]</sup></em></a> becomes an interesting alternative as well:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">data.<span class="hljs-property">items</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">forEach</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">value, index, array</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// The callback is executed for each element in the array.</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// `value` is the element itself (equivalent to `array[index]`)</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// `index` will be the index of the element in the array</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// `array` is a reference to the array itself (i.e. `data.items` in this case)</span>
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>In environments supporting ES2015 (ES6), you can also use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of" rel="noreferrer"><em><code>for...of</code></em> <em><sup>[MDN]</sup></em></a> loop, which not only works for arrays, but for any <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#iterable" rel="noreferrer"><em>iterable</em></a>:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> item <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> data.<span class="hljs-property">items</span>) {
   <span class="hljs-comment">// `item` is the array element, **not** the index</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>In each iteration, <code>for...of</code> directly gives us the next element of the iterable, there is no "index" to access or use.</p>

<h3>What if the "depth" of the data structure is unknown to me?</h3>

<p>In addition to unknown keys, the "depth" of the data structure (i.e. how many nested objects) it has, might be unknown as well. How to access deeply nested properties usually depends on the exact data structure.</p>

<p>But if the data structure contains repeating patterns, e.g. the representation of a binary tree, the solution typically includes to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_%28computer_science%29" rel="noreferrer"><strong>recursively</strong> <em><sup>[Wikipedia]</sup></em></a> access each level of the data structure.</p>

<p>Here is an example to get the first leaf node of a binary tree:</p>

<p>A more generic way to access a nested data structure with unknown keys and depth is to test the type of the value and act accordingly.</p>

<p>Here is an example which adds all primitive values inside a nested data structure into an array (assuming it does not contain any functions). If we encounter an object (or array) we simply call <code>toArray</code> again on that value (recursive call).</p>

<h2>Helpers</h2>

<p>Since the structure of a complex object or array is not necessarily obvious, we can inspect the value at each step to decide how to move further. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/console.log" rel="noreferrer"><code>console.log</code> <em><sup>[MDN]</sup></em></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/console.dir" rel="noreferrer"><code>console.dir</code> <em><sup>[MDN]</sup></em></a> help us doing this. For example (output of the Chrome console):</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&gt; <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(data.<span class="hljs-property">items</span>)
 [ <span class="hljs-title class_">Object</span>, <span class="hljs-title class_">Object</span> ]
</code></pre>

<p>Here we see that that <code>data.items</code> is an array with two elements which are both objects. In Chrome console the objects can even be expanded and inspected immediately.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&gt; <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(data.<span class="hljs-property">items</span>[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>])
  <span class="hljs-title class_">Object</span>
     <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>: <span class="hljs-number">2</span>
     <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span>
     <span class="hljs-attr">__proto__</span>: <span class="hljs-title class_">Object</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This tells us that <code>data.items[1]</code> is an object, and after expanding it we see that it has three properties, <code>id</code>, <code>name</code> and <code>__proto__</code>. The latter is an internal property used for the prototype chain of the object. The prototype chain and inheritance is out of scope for this answer, though.</p>

<p>It's very convenient to iterate the result of <code>Object.entries()</code> with a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of" rel="noreferrer">for-of loop</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment" rel="noreferrer">destructuring assignment</a>.</p>

<p>For-of loop lets you iterate array elements. The syntax is <code>for (const element of array)</code> (we can replace <code>const</code> with <code>var</code> or <code>let</code>, but it's better to use <code>const</code> if we don't intend to modify <code>element</code>).</p>

<p>Destructuring assignment lets you extract values from an array or an object and assign them to variables. In this case <code>const [key, value]</code> means that instead of assigning the <code>[key, value]</code> array to <code>element</code>, we assign the first element of that array to <code>key</code> and the second element to <code>value</code>. It is equivalent to this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> element <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Object</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">entries</span>(obj)) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> key = element[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]
       ,value = element[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, destructuring makes this a lot simpler.</p>

<h2><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every" rel="noreferrer"><code>Array.prototype.every()</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some" rel="noreferrer"><code>Array.prototype.some()</code></a></h2>

<p>The <code>every()</code> method returns <code>true</code> if the specified callback function returns <code>true</code> for <em>every</em> element of the array. The <code>some()</code> method returns <code>true</code> if the specified callback function returns <code>true</code> for <em>some</em> (at least one) element.</p>

<p>In case you're trying to access an <code>item</code> from the example structure by <code>id</code> or <code>name</code>, without knowing it's position in the array, the easiest way to do it would be to use <a href="http://underscorejs.org/" rel="noreferrer">underscore.js</a> library:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> data = {
    <span class="hljs-attr">code</span>: <span class="hljs-number">42</span>,

});
<span class="hljs-comment">// Object {id: 2, name: "bar"}</span>
</code></pre>

<p>From my experience, using higher order functions instead of <code>for</code> or <code>for..in</code> loops results in code that is easier to reason about, and hence more maintainable.</p>

<p>Just my 2 cents.</p>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution5" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl border p-10 shadow-md w-9/12 bg-white"><h4 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 5</h4><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>At times, accessing a nested object using a string can be desirable. The simple approach is the first level, for example</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> obj = { <span class="hljs-attr">hello</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"world"</span> };
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> key = <span class="hljs-string">"hello"</span>;
<span class="hljs-title function_">alert</span>(obj[key]);<span class="hljs-comment">//world</span>
</code></pre>

<p>But this is often not the case with complex json. As json becomes more complex, the approaches for finding values inside of the json also become complex. A recursive approach for navigating the json is best, and how that recursion is leveraged will depend on the type of data being searched for. If there are conditional statements involved, a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11657379/1026459">json search</a> can be a good tool to use.</p>

<p>If the property being accessed is already known, but the path is complex, for example in this object</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> obj = {
 <span class="hljs-attr">arr</span>: [
    { <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"larry"</span> },    
    { <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>: <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"curly"</span> },
    { <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>: <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"moe"</span> }
 ]
};
</code></pre>

<p>And you know you want to get the first result of the array in the object, perhaps you would like to use</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> moe = obj[<span class="hljs-string">"arr[0].name"</span>];
</code></pre>

<p>However, that will cause an exception as there is no property of object with that name. The solution to be able to use this would be to flatten the tree aspect of the object. This can be done recursively.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">flatten</span>(<span class="hljs-params">obj</span>){
 <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> root = {};
 (<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">tree</span>(<span class="hljs-params">obj, index</span>){
   <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> suffix = toString.<span class="hljs-title function_">call</span>(obj) == <span class="hljs-string">"[object Array]"</span> ? <span class="hljs-string">"]"</span> : <span class="hljs-string">""</span>;
   <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> key <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> obj){
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(!obj.<span class="hljs-title function_">hasOwnProperty</span>(key))<span class="hljs-keyword">continue</span>;
    root[index+key+suffix] = obj[key];
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>( toString.<span class="hljs-title function_">call</span>(obj[key]) == <span class="hljs-string">"[object Array]"</span> )<span class="hljs-title function_">tree</span>(obj[key],index+key+suffix+<span class="hljs-string">"["</span>);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>( toString.<span class="hljs-title function_">call</span>(obj[key]) == <span class="hljs-string">"[object Object]"</span> )<span class="hljs-title function_">tree</span>(obj[key],index+key+suffix+<span class="hljs-string">"."</span>);   
   }
 })(obj,<span class="hljs-string">""</span>);
 <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> root;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the complex object can be flattened</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> obj = previous definition;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> flat = <span class="hljs-title function_">flatten</span>(obj);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> moe = flat[<span class="hljs-string">"arr[0].name"</span>];<span class="hljs-comment">//moe</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a <strong><em><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/73172hr0/" rel="noreferrer"><code>jsFiddle Demo</code></a></em></strong> of this approach being used.</p>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution6" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl border p-10 shadow-md w-9/12 bg-white"><h4 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 6</h4><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>To access a nested attribute, you need to specify its name and then search through the object.</p>

<p>If you already know the exact path, then you can hardcode it in your script like so:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">data[<span class="hljs-string">'items'</span>][<span class="hljs-number">1</span>][<span class="hljs-string">'name'</span>]
</code></pre>

<p>these also work -</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">data.<span class="hljs-property">items</span>[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>].<span class="hljs-property">name</span>
data[<span class="hljs-string">'items'</span>][<span class="hljs-number">1</span>].<span class="hljs-property">name</span>
data.<span class="hljs-property">items</span>[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>][<span class="hljs-string">'name'</span>]
</code></pre>

<p>When you don't know the exact name before hand, or a user is the one who provides the name for you. Then dynamically searching through the data structure is required. Some suggested here that the search can be done using a <code>for</code> loop, but there is a very simple way to traverse a path using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce" rel="noreferrer"><code>Array.reduce</code></a>.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> data = { <span class="hljs-attr">code</span>: <span class="hljs-number">42</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">items</span>: [{ <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span> }, { <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>: <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'bar'</span> }] }
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> path = [ <span class="hljs-string">'items'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'1'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'name'</span>]
<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> result = path.<span class="hljs-title function_">reduce</span>(<span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">a,v</span>) =&gt;</span> a[v], data)
</code></pre>

<p>The path is a way to say: First take the object with key <code>items</code>, which happens to be an array. Then take the <code>1</code>-st element (0 index arrays). Last take the object with key <code>name</code> in that array element, which happens to be the string <code>bar</code>.</p>

<p>If you have a very long path, you might even use <code>String.split</code> to make all of this easier -</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-string">'items.1.name'</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">split</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'.'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">reduce</span>(<span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">a,v</span>) =&gt;</span> a[v], data)
</code></pre>

<p>This question is quite old, so as a contemporary update. With the onset of ES2015 there are alternatives to get a hold of the data you require. There is now a feature called <strong>object destructuring</strong> for accessing nested objects.</p>

<p>The above example creates a variable called <code>secondName</code> from the <code>name</code> key from an array called <code>items</code>, the lonely <code>,</code> says skip the first object in the array. </p>

<p>Notably it's probably overkill for this example, as simple array acccess is easier to read, but it comes in useful when breaking apart objects in general. </p>

<p>This is very brief intro to your specific use case, destructuring can be an unusual syntax to get used to at first.

<p>Basically, use a dot between each descendant that unfolds underneath it and when you have object names made out of two strings, you must use the ["obj Name"] notation. Otherwise, just a dot would suffice;</p>

<p>Just in case, anyone's visiting this question in 2017 or later and looking for an <strong>easy-to-remember</strong> way, here's an elaborate blog post on <a href="https://dev.to/flexdinesh/accessing-nested-objects-in-javascript--9m4" rel="noreferrer">Accessing Nested Objects in JavaScript</a> without being bamboozled by </p>

<p><em>Cannot read property 'foo' of undefined</em> error</p>

<h2>1. Oliver Steele's nested object access pattern</h2>

<p>The easiest and the cleanest way is to use Oliver Steele's nested object access pattern</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> name = ((user || {}).<span class="hljs-property">personalInfo</span> || {}).<span class="hljs-property">name</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>With this notation, you'll never run into</p>

<p><em>Cannot read property 'name' of undefined</em>. </p>

<p>You basically check if user exists, if not, you create an empty object on the fly. This way, the next level key will <strong>always be accessed from an object that exists or an empty object</strong>, but never from undefined.</p>

<h2>2. Access Nested Objects Using Array Reduce</h2>

<p>To be able to access nested arrays, you can write your own array reduce util.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">getNestedObject</span> = (<span class="hljs-params">nestedObj, pathArr</span>) =&gt; {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> pathArr.<span class="hljs-title function_">reduce</span>(<span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">obj, key</span>) =&gt;</span>
        (obj &amp;&amp; obj[key] !== <span class="hljs-string">'undefined'</span>) ? obj[key] : <span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span>, nestedObj);
}

<span class="hljs-comment">// pass in your object structure as array elements</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> name = <span class="hljs-title function_">getNestedObject</span>(user, [<span class="hljs-string">'personalInfo'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'name'</span>]);

<span class="hljs-comment">// to access nested array, just pass in array index as an element the path array.</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> city = <span class="hljs-title function_">getNestedObject</span>(user, [<span class="hljs-string">'personalInfo'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'addresses'</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'city'</span>]);
<span class="hljs-comment">// this will return the city from the first address item.</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Old question but as nobody mentioned lodash (just underscore).</p>

<p>In case you are already using lodash in your project, I think an elegant way to do this in a complex example:</p>

<p><strong>Opt 1</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">_.<span class="hljs-title function_">get</span>(response, [<span class="hljs-string">'output'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'fund'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'data'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'0'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'children'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'0'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'group'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'myValue'</span>], <span class="hljs-string">''</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>same as:</p>

<p><strong>Opt 2</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">response.<span class="hljs-property">output</span>.<span class="hljs-property">fund</span>.<span class="hljs-property">data</span>[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>].<span class="hljs-property">children</span>[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>].<span class="hljs-property">group</span>.<span class="hljs-property">myValue</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The difference between the first and second option is that in the <strong>Opt 1</strong> if you have one of the properties missing (undefined) in the path you don't get an error, it returns you the third parameter.</p>

<p>For array filter lodash has <code>_.find()</code> but I'd rather use the regular <code>filter()</code>. But I still think the above method <code>_.get()</code> is super useful when working with really complex data. I faced in the past really complex APIs and it was handy!</p>

<p>I hope it can be useful for who's looking for options to manipulate really complex data which the title implies.</p>

<p>If you're trying to find a path in a JSON string, you can dump your data into <a href="https://jsonpathfinder.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://jsonpathfinder.com</a> and click on the GUI elements. It'll generate the JS syntax for the path to the element.</p>
<p>Beyond that, for any arrays you might want to iterate, replace the relevant array offset indices like <code>[0]</code> with a loop.</p>
