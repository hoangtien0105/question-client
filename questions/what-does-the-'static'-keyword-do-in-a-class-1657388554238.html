It was dup&apos;d to this question, but I don&apos;t think the etymology has been clearly addressed. So...\n\n\n\nIt&apos;s due to keyword reuse, starting with C.\n\nConsider data declarations in C (inside a function body):\n\n    void f() {\n        int foo = 1;\n        static int bar = 2;\n         :\n    }\n\n\nThe variable foo is created on the stack when the function is entered (and destroyed when the function terminates).  By contrast, bar is always there, so it&apos;s &apos;static&apos; in the sense of common English - it&apos;s not going anywhere.\n\nJava, and similar languages, have the same concept for data. Data can either be allocated per instance of the class (per object) or once for the entire class. Since Java aims to have familiar syntax for C/C++ programmers, the &apos;static&apos; keyword is appropriate here.\n\n    class C {\n        int foo = 1;\n        static int bar = 2;\n         :\n    }\n\n\nLastly, we come to methods.\n\n    class C {\n        int foo() { ... }\n        static int bar() { ... }\n         :\n    }\n\n\nThere is, conceptually speaking, an instance of foo() for every instance of class C.  There is only one instance of bar() for the entire class C. This is parallel to the case we discussed for data, and therefore using &apos;static&apos; is again a sensible choice, especially if you don&apos;t want to add more reserved keywords to your language.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution20","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Static Variables Can only be accessed only in static methods, so when we declare the static variables those getter and setter methods will be static methods\n\nstatic methods is a class level we can access using class name\n\nThe following is  example for Static Variables Getters And Setters:\n\npublic class Static \n{\n\n    private static String owner;\n    private static int rent;\n    private String car;\n    public String getCar() {\n        return car;\n    }\n    public void setCar(String car) {\n        this.car = car;\n    }\n    public static int getRent() {\n        return rent;\n    }\n    public static void setRent(int rent) {\n        Static.rent = rent;\n    }\n    public static String getOwner() {\n        return owner;\n    }\n\n    public static void setOwner(String owner) {\n        Static.owner = owner;\n    }\n\n}\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution21","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"A member in a Java program can be declared as static using the keyword static preceding its declaration/definition. When a member is declared static, then it essentially means that the member is shared by all the instances of a class without making copies of per instance.\nThus static is a non-class modifier used in Java and can be applied to the following members:\n\nVariables\nMethods\nBlocks\nClasses (more specifically, nested classes)\n\nWhen a member is declared static, then it can be accessed without using an object. This means that before a class is instantiated, the static member is active and accessible. Unlike other non-static class members that cease to exist when the object of the class goes out of scope, the static member is still obviously active.\nStatic Variable in Java\nA member variable of a class that is declared as static is called the Static Variable. It is also called as the Class variable. Once the variable is declared as static, memory is allocated only once and not every time when a class is instantiated. Hence you can access the static variable without a reference to an object.\nThe following Java program depicts the usage of Static variables:\nclass Main\n{\n// static variables a and b\nstatic int a = 10;\nstatic int b;\n\nstatic void printStatic()\n{\n    a = a /2;\n    b = a;\n\n    System.out.println(&quot;printStatic::Value of a : &quot;+a + &quot; Value of b : \n &quot;+b);\n}  \n\npublic static void main(String[] args)\n{\n   printStatic();\n   b = a*5;\n   a++;\n\nSystem.out.println(&quot;main::Value of a : &quot;+a + &quot; Value of b : &quot;+b);\n   }\n }\n\noutput::\nprintStatic::Value of a : Value of b : 5\nmain::Value of a : 6 Value of b : 25\n\nIn the above program, we have two static variables i.e. a and b. We modify these variables in a function printStatic as well as in main. Note that the values of these static variables are preserved across the functions even when the scope of the function ends. The output shows the values of variables in two functions.\nStatic Method\nA method in Java is static when it is preceded by the keyword static.\nSome points that you need to remember about the static method include:\n\nA static method belongs to the class as against other non-static\nmethods that are invoked using the instance of a class.\nTo invoke a static method, you dont need a class object.\nThe static data members of the class are accessible to the static\nmethod. The static method can even change the values of the static\ndata member.\nA static method cannot have a reference to this or super members.\nEven if a static method tries to refer them, it will be a compiler\nerror.\nJust like static data, the static method can also call other static\nmethods. A static method cannot refer to non-static data members or\nvariables and cannot call non-static methods too.\n\nThe following program shows the implementation of the static method in Java:\nclass Main\n{\n  // static method\n  static void static_method()\n{\n    System.out.println(&quot;Static method in Java...called without any \nobject&quot;);\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args)\n{\n    static_method();\n   }\n }\n\noutput:\nStatic method in Java...called without any object\n\nStatic Block In Java\nJust as you have function blocks in programming languages like C++, C#, etc. in Java also, there is a special block called static block that usually includes a block of code related to static data.\nThis static block is executed at the moment when the first object of the class is created (precisely at the time of classloading) or when the static member inside the block is used.\nThe following program shows the usage of a static block.\nclass Main\n{\n  static int sum = 0;\n  static int val1 = 5;\n  static int val2;\n\n// static block\n static {\n    sum = val1 + val2;\n    System.out.println(&quot;In static block, val1: &quot; + val1  + &quot; val2: &quot;+ \nval2 + &quot; sum:&quot; + sum);\n    val2 = val1 * 3;\n    sum = val1 + val2;\n}\n\n public static void main(String[] args)\n{\n    System.out.println(&quot;In main function, val1: &quot; + val1  + &quot; val2: &quot;+ val2 + &quot; sum:&quot; + sum);\n  }\n}\n\noutput:\nIn static block, val1: 5 val2: 0 sum:5\nIn main function, val1: val2: 15 sum:20\n\nStatic Class\nIn Java, you have static blocks, static methods, and even static variables. Hence its obvious that you can also have static classes. In Java, it is possible to have a class inside another class and this is called a Nested class. The class that encloses the nested class is called the Outer class.\nIn Java, although you can declare a nested class as Static it is not possible to have the outer class as Static.\nLets now explore the static nested classes in Java.\nStatic Nested Class\nAs already mentioned, you can have a nested class in Java declared as static. The static nested class differs from the non-static nested class(inner class) in certain aspects as listed below.\nUnlike the non-static nested class, the nested static class doesnt need an outer class reference.\nA static nested class can access only static members of the outer class as against the non-static classes that can access static as well as non-static members of the outer class.\nAn example of a static nested class is given below.\n\nclass Main{\n  private static String str = &quot;SoftwareTestingHelp&quot;;\n\n     //Static nested class\n     static class NestedClass{\n        //non-static method\n            public void display() {\n\n            System.out.println(&quot;Static string in OuterClass: &quot; + str);\n            }\n\n    }\n   public static void main(String args[])\n   {\n            Main.NestedClassobj = new Main.NestedClass();\n            obj.display();\n   }\n}\n\noutput\nStatic string in OuterClass: SoftwareTestingHelp\n\nI think this is how static keyword works in java.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution22","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0}],"@type":"Question"}}</script><meta name="next-head-count" content="16"/><link rel="preload" href="/_next/static/css/9fb80f4eb9e2d3c9.css" as="style"/><link rel="stylesheet" href="/_next/static/css/9fb80f4eb9e2d3c9.css" data-n-g=""/><noscript data-n-css=""></noscript><script defer="" nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-0d1b80a048d4787e.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-cb7634a8b6194820.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework-4556c45dd113b893.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-25e5079ab4bd6ecd.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-88567075f6bc9c6b.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/29107295-fbcfe2172188e46f.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/532-fec3344a80918110.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/495-bb1d5b202c02d7f2.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/817-363561828babdd16.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/81-2e45c38dc6fe8298.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/questions/%5Bslug%5D-16d8c84aea765d4e.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/d4czOeg3MGPNUI9SipfjN/_buildManifest.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/d4czOeg3MGPNUI9SipfjN/_ssgManifest.js" defer=""></script><style data-styled="" data-styled-version="5.3.5">.dlbxiY code{padding:5px;color:hsl(210deg 8% 15%);background-color:hsl(210deg 8% 90%);border-radius:3px;}/*!sc*/

<p>But it gave the error </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cannot access non-static field in static method main</p>

<p>So I changed the declaration of <code>clock</code> to this:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-type">Clock</span> <span class="hljs-variable">clock</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Clock</span>();

<p>And it worked. What does it mean to put that keyword before the declaration? What exactly will it do and/or restrict in terms of what can be done to that object?</p>

<p>It means that <b>only one instance of a <code>static</code> field exists</b><sup>[1]</sup> even if you create a million instances of the class or you don't create any. It will be shared by all instances.</p>

<p>Since <code>static</code> methods also do not belong to a specific instance, they can't refer to instance members. In the example given, <code>main</code> does not know which instance of the <code>Hello</code> class (and therefore which instance of the <code>Clock</code> class) it should refer to. <code>static</code> members can only refer to <code>static</code> members. Instance members can, of course access <code>static</code> members.</p>

<p>It means that there is only one instance of "clock" in Hello, not one per each separate instance of the "Hello" class, or more-so, it means that there will be one commonly shared "clock" reference among all instances of the "Hello" class.</p>

<p>So if you were to do a "new Hello" anywhere in your code:
A- in the first scenario (before the change, without using "static"), it would make a new clock every time a "new Hello" is called, but 
B- in the second scenario (after the change, using "static"), every "new Hello" instance would still share and use the initial and same "clock" reference first created.</p>

<p>Unless you needed "clock" somewhere outside of main, this would work just as well:</p>

<p>The <code>static</code> keyword means that something (a field, method or nested class) is related to the <em>type</em> rather than any particular <em>instance</em> of the type. So for example, one calls <code>Math.sin(...)</code> without any instance of the <code>Math</code> class, and indeed you <em>can't</em> create an instance of the <code>Math</code> class.</p>

<p><strong>Sidenote</strong></p>

<p>Java unfortunately <em>allows</em> you to access static members as if they were instance members, e.g.</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-comment">// Bad code!</span>
Thread.currentThread().sleep(<span class="hljs-number">5000</span>);
someOtherThread.sleep(<span class="hljs-number">5000</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>That makes it <em>look</em> as if <code>sleep</code> is an instance method, but it's actually a static method - it <em>always</em> makes the current thread sleep. It's better practice to make this clear in the calling code:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-comment">// Clearer</span>
Thread.sleep(<span class="hljs-number">5000</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>static</code> keyword in Java means that the variable or function is shared between all instances of that class as it belongs to the <em>type</em>, not the actual objects themselves.</p>

<p>So if you have a variable: <code>private static int i = 0;</code> and you increment it (<code>i++</code>) in one instance, the change will be reflected in all instances. <code>i</code> will now be 1 in all instances.</p>

<p>Static methods can be used without instantiating an object.</p>

    hello2.staticValue; <span class="hljs-comment">// will have value of "abc"</span>
    hello2.nonStaticValue; <span class="hljs-comment">// will have value of null</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's how you can have values shared in all class members without sending class instance Hello to other class. And whit static you don't need to create class instance.</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">Hello</span> <span class="hljs-variable">hello</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Hello</span>();
hello.staticValue = <span class="hljs-string">"abc"</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>You can just call static values or methods by class name:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">Hello.staticValue = <span class="hljs-string">"abc"</span>;

<p>Static means that you don't have to create an instance of the class to use the methods or variables associated with the class. In your example, you could call:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">Hello.main(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>[]()) <span class="hljs-comment">//main(...) is declared as a static function in the Hello class</span>

<p>directly, instead of:</p>

h.main(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>[]()); <span class="hljs-comment">//main(...) is a non-static function linked with the "h" variable</span>
</code></pre>

<p>From inside a static method (which belongs to a class) you cannot access any members which are not static, since their values depend on your instantiation of the class. A non-static Clock object, which is an instance member, would have a different value/reference for each instance of your Hello class, and therefore you could not access it from the static portion of the class.</p>

<p>In this case static variable will get the memory only once, if any object changes the value of the static variable, it will retain its value.</p>

<p><strong>Static with Final:</strong></p>

<p>The global variable which is declared as <strong>final and static</strong> remains unchanged for the whole execution. Because, Static members are stored in the class memory and they are loaded only once in the whole execution. They are common to all objects of the class. If you declare static variables as final, any of the objects cant change their value as it is final. Therefore, variables declared as final and static are sometimes referred to as Constants. All fields of interfaces are referred as constants, because they are final and static by default.</p>

<p>To add to existing answers, let me try with a picture:</p>

<p>An interest rate of 2% is applied to ALL savings accounts. Hence it is <strong>static</strong>.</p>

<p>A balance should be <strong>individual</strong>, so it is <strong>not</strong> static.</p>

<p>A field can be assigned to either the class or an instance of a class. By default fields are instance variables. By using <code>static</code> the field becomes a class variable, thus there is one and only one <code>clock</code>. If you make a changes in one place, it's visible everywhere. Instance varables are changed independently of one another.</p>

<p>The keyword <code>static</code> is used to denote a field or a method as belonging to the class itself and not to any particular instance.  Using your code, if the object <code>Clock</code> is static, all of the instances of the <code>Hello</code> class will share this <code>Clock</code> data member (field) in common.  If you make it non-static, each individual instance of <code>Hello</code> will have a unique <code>Clock</code>.</p>
<p>You added a <em>main</em> method to your class <code>Hello</code> so that you could run the code.  The problem with that is that the <em>main</em> method is static and as such, it cannot refer to non-static fields or methods inside of it.  You can resolve this in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make all fields and methods of the <code>Hello</code> class static so that they could be referred to inside the <em>main</em> method.  This is not a good thing to do (or the wrong reason to make a field and/or a method static)</li>
<li>Create an instance of your <code>Hello</code> class inside the main method and access all its fields and methods the way they were intended to be accessed and used in the first place.</li>
</ol>
<p>For you, this means the following change to your code:</p>

<p>In Java, the <code>static</code> keyword can be simply regarded as indicating the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"without regard or relationship to any particular instance"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you think of <code>static</code> in this way, it becomes easier to understand its use in the various contexts in which it is encountered:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A <code>static</code> field is a field that belongs to the class rather than to any particular instance</p></li>
<li><p>A <code>static</code> method is a method that has no notion of <code>this</code>; it is defined on the class and doesn't know about any particular instance of that class unless a reference is passed to it</p></li>
<li><p>A <code>static</code> member class is a nested class without any notion or knowledge of an instance of its enclosing class (unless a reference to an enclosing class instance is passed to it)</p></li>

<p>Static makes the clock member a class member instead of an instance member. Without the static keyword you would need to create an instance of the Hello class (which has a clock member variable) - e.g.</p>

<p>I have developed a liking for static methods (only, if possible) in "helper" classes.</p>

<p>The calling class need not create another member (instance) variable of the helper class. You just call the methods of the helper class. Also the helper class is improved because you no longer need a constructor, and you need no member (instance) variables.</p>

<p>There are probably other advantages.</p>

<p>A question was asked <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60788631/whats-the-etymology-of-static-method">here</a> about the choice of the word 'static' for this concept.  It was dup'd to this question, but I don't think the etymology has been clearly addressed. So...</p>

<hr>

<p>It's due to keyword reuse, starting with C.</p>

<p>Consider data declarations in C (inside a function body):</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">    <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">f</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> {
        <span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">foo</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
        <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">bar</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span>;
         :
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The variable foo is created on the stack when the function is entered (and destroyed when the function terminates).  By contrast, bar is always there, so it's 'static' in the sense of common English - it's not going anywhere.</p>

<p>Java, and similar languages, have the same concept for data. Data can either be allocated per instance of the class (per object) or once for the entire class. Since Java aims to have familiar syntax for C/C++ programmers, the 'static' keyword is appropriate here.</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">    <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">C</span> {
        <span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">foo</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
        <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">bar</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span>;
         :
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, we come to methods.</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">    <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">C</span> {
        <span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> { ... }
        <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">bar</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> { ... }
         :
    }
</code></pre>

<p>There is, conceptually speaking, an instance of foo() for every instance of class C.  There is only one instance of bar() for the entire class C. This is parallel to the case we discussed for data, and therefore using 'static' is again a sensible choice, especially if you don't want to add more reserved keywords to your language.</p>

<p>A member in a Java program can be declared as static using the keyword static preceding its declaration/definition. When a member is declared static, then it essentially means that the member is shared by all the instances of a class without making copies of per instance.</p>
<p><strong>Thus static is a non-class modifier used in Java and can be applied to the following members:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Variables</li>
<li>Methods</li>
<li>Blocks</li>
<li>Classes (more specifically, nested classes)</li>
</ul>
<p>When a member is declared static, then it can be accessed without using an object. This means that before a class is instantiated, the static member is active and accessible. Unlike other non-static class members that cease to exist when the object of the class goes out of scope, the static member is still obviously active.</p>
<p><strong>Static Variable in Java</strong></p>
<p>A member variable of a class that is declared as static is called the Static Variable. It is also called as the Class variable. Once the variable is declared as static, memory is allocated only once and not every time when a class is instantiated. Hence you can access the static variable without a reference to an object.</p>
<p><strong>The following Java program depicts the usage of Static variables:</strong></p>

<p>In the above program, we have two static variables i.e. a and b. We modify these variables in a function printStatic as well as in main. Note that the values of these static variables are preserved across the functions even when the scope of the function ends. The output shows the values of variables in two functions.</p>
<p><strong>Static Method</strong></p>
<p>A method in Java is static when it is preceded by the keyword static.</p>
<p><strong>Some points that you need to remember about the static method include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A static method belongs to the class as against other non-static
methods that are invoked using the instance of a class.</li>
<li>To invoke a static method, you dont need a class object.</li>
<li>The static data members of the class are accessible to the static
method. The static method can even change the values of the static
data member.</li>
<li>A static method cannot have a reference to this or super members.
Even if a static method tries to refer them, it will be a compiler
error.</li>
<li>Just like static data, the static method can also call other static
methods. A static method cannot refer to non-static data members or
variables and cannot call non-static methods too.</li>

<p><strong>Static Block In Java</strong></p>
<p>Just as you have function blocks in programming languages like C++, C#, etc. in Java also, there is a special block called static block that usually includes a block of code related to static data.</p>
<p>This static block is executed at the moment when the first object of the class is created (precisely at the time of classloading) or when the static member inside the block is used.</p>
<p><strong>The following program shows the usage of a static block.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Static Class</strong></p>
<p>In Java, you have static blocks, static methods, and even static variables. Hence its obvious that you can also have static classes. In Java, it is possible to have a class inside another class and this is called a Nested class. The class that encloses the nested class is called the Outer class.</p>
<p>In Java, although you can declare a nested class as Static it is not possible to have the outer class as Static.</p>
<p>Lets now explore the static nested classes in Java.</p>
<p><strong>Static Nested Class</strong></p>
<p>As already mentioned, you can have a nested class in Java declared as static. The static nested class differs from the non-static nested class(inner class) in certain aspects as listed below.</p>
<p>Unlike the non-static nested class, the nested static class doesnt need an outer class reference.</p>
<p>A static nested class can access only static members of the outer class as against the non-static classes that can access static as well as non-static members of the outer class.</p>
<p>An example of a static nested class is given below.</p>

Using your code, if the object \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Clock\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is static, all of the instances of the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Hello\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; class will share this \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Clock\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; data member (field) in common.
