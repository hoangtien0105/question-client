See http://php.net/manual/en/array.sorting.php for an overview and links to further details.\nMulti dimensional arrays, including arrays of objects\n$array = array(\n    array(&apos;foo&apos; =&gt; &apos;bar&apos;, &apos;baz&apos; =&gt; 42),\n    array(&apos;foo&apos; =&gt; ...,   &apos;baz&apos; =&gt; ...),\n    ...\n);\n\nIf you want to sort $array by the key &apos;foo&apos; of each entry, you need a custom comparison function. The above sort and related functions work on simple values that they know how to compare and sort. PHP does not simply &quot;know&quot; what to do with a complex value like array(&apos;foo&apos; =&gt; &apos;bar&apos;, &apos;baz&apos; =&gt; 42) though; so you need to tell it.\nTo do that, you need to create a comparison function. That function takes two elements and must return 0 if these elements are considered equal, a value lower than 0 if the first value is lower and a value higher than 0 if the first value is higher. That&apos;s all that&apos;s needed:\nfunction cmp(array $a, array $b) {\n    if ($a[&apos;foo&apos;] &lt; $b[&apos;foo&apos;]) {\n        return -1;\n    } else if ($a[&apos;foo&apos;] &gt; $b[&apos;foo&apos;]) {\n        return 1;\n    } else {\n        return 0;\n    }\n}\n\nOften, you will want to use an anonymous function as the callback. If you want to use a method or static method, see the other ways of specifying a callback in PHP.\nYou then use one of these functions:\n\nusort\nuasort\nuksort\n\nAgain, they only differ in whether they keep key-value associations and sort by values or keys. Read their documentation for details.\nExample usage:\nusort($array, &apos;cmp&apos;);\n\nusort will take two items from the array and call your cmp function with them. So cmp() will be called with $a as array(&apos;foo&apos; =&gt; &apos;bar&apos;, &apos;baz&apos; =&gt; 42) and $b as another array(&apos;foo&apos; =&gt; ..., &apos;baz&apos; =&gt; ...). The function then returns to usort which of the values was larger or whether they were equal. usort repeats this process passing different values for $a and $b until the array is sorted. The cmp function will be called many times, at least as many times as there are values in $array, with different combinations of values for $a and $b every time.\nTo get used to this idea, try this:\nfunction cmp($a, $b) {\n    echo &apos;cmp called with $a:&apos;, PHP_EOL;\n    var_dump($a);\n    echo &apos;and $b:&apos;, PHP_EOL;\n    var_dump($b);\n}\n\nAll you did was define a custom way to compare two items, that&apos;s all you need. That works with all sorts of values.\nBy the way, this works on any value, the values don&apos;t have to be complex arrays. If you have a custom comparison you want to do, you can do it on a simple array of numbers too.\nsort sorts by reference and does not return anything useful!\nNote that the array sorts in place, you do not need to assign the return value to anything. $array = sort($array) will replace the array with true, not with a sorted array. Just sort($array); works.\nCustom numeric comparisons\nIf you want to sort by the baz key, which is numeric, all you need to do is:\nfunction cmp(array $a, array $b) {\n    return $a[&apos;baz&apos;] - $b[&apos;baz&apos;];\n}\n\nThanks to The PoWEr oF MATH this returns a value &lt; 0, 0 or &gt; 0 depending on whether $a is lower than, equal to or larger than $b.\nNote that this won&apos;t work well for float values, since they&apos;ll be reduced to an int and lose precision. Use explicit -1, 0 and 1 return values instead.\nObjects\nIf you have an array of objects, it works the same way:\nfunction cmp($a, $b) {\n    return $a-&gt;baz - $b-&gt;baz;\n}\n\nFunctions\nYou can do anything you need inside a comparison function, including calling functions:\nfunction cmp(array $a, array $b) {\n    return someFunction($a[&apos;baz&apos;]) - someFunction($b[&apos;baz&apos;]);\n}\n\nStrings\nA shortcut for the first string comparison version:\nfunction cmp(array $a, array $b) {\n    return strcmp($a[&apos;foo&apos;], $b[&apos;foo&apos;]);\n}\n\nstrcmp does exactly what&apos;s expected of cmp here, it returns -1, 0 or 1.\nSpaceship operator\nPHP 7 introduced the spaceship operator, which unifies and simplifies equal/smaller/larger than comparisons across types:\nfunction cmp(array $a, array $b) {\n    return $a[&apos;foo&apos;] &lt;=&gt; $b[&apos;foo&apos;];\n}\n\nSorting by multiple fields\nIf you want to sort primarily by foo, but if foo is equal for two elements sort by baz:\nfunction cmp(array $a, array $b) {\n    if (($cmp = strcmp($a[&apos;foo&apos;], $b[&apos;foo&apos;])) !== 0) {\n        return $cmp;\n    } else {\n        return $a[&apos;baz&apos;] - $b[&apos;baz&apos;];\n    }\n}\n\nFor those familiar, this is equivalent to an SQL query with ORDER BY foo, baz.\nAlso see this very neat shorthand version and how to create such a comparison function dynamically for an arbitrary number of keys.\nSorting into a manual, static order\nIf you want to sort elements into a &quot;manual order&quot; like &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;:\nfunction cmp(array $a, array $b) {\n    static $order = array(&apos;foo&apos;, &apos;bar&apos;, &apos;baz&apos;);\n    return array_search($a[&apos;foo&apos;], $order) - array_search($b[&apos;foo&apos;], $order);\n}\n\n\nFor all the above, if you&apos;re using PHP 5.3 or higher (and you really should), use anonymous functions for shorter code and to avoid having another global function floating around:\nusort($array, function (array $a, array $b) { return $a[&apos;baz&apos;] - $b[&apos;baz&apos;]; });\n\nThat&apos;s how simple sorting a complex multi-dimensional array can be. Again, just think in terms of teaching PHP how to tell which of two items is &quot;greater&quot;; let PHP do the actual sorting.\nAlso for all of the above, to switch between ascending and descending order simply swap the $a and $b arguments around. E.g.:\nreturn $a[&apos;baz&apos;] - $b[&apos;baz&apos;]; // ascending\nreturn $b[&apos;baz&apos;] - $a[&apos;baz&apos;]; // descending\n\nSorting one array based on another\nAnd then there&apos;s the peculiar array_multisort, which lets you sort one array based on another:\n$array1 = array( 4,   6,   1);\n$array2 = array(&apos;a&apos;, &apos;b&apos;, &apos;c&apos;);\n\nThe expected result here would be:\n$array2 = array(&apos;c&apos;, &apos;a&apos;, &apos;b&apos;);  // the sorted order of $array1\n\nUse array_multisort to get there:\narray_multisort($array1, $array2);\n\nAs of PHP 5.5.0 you can use array_column to extract a column from a multi dimensional array and sort the array on that column:\narray_multisort(array_column($array, &apos;foo&apos;), SORT_DESC, $array);\n\nYou can also sort on more than one column each in either direction:\narray_multisort(array_column($array, &apos;foo&apos;), SORT_DESC,\n                array_column($array, &apos;bar&apos;), SORT_ASC,\n                $array);\n\nAs of PHP 7.0.0 you can also extract properties from an array of objects.\n\n\nIf you have more common cases, feel free to edit this answer.\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Well most basic methods are already covered by deceze I would try to look at other types of sort\n\nSorting with SPL\n\nSplHeap\n\nclass SimpleHeapSort extends SplHeap {\n    public function compare($a, $b) {\n        return strcmp($a, $b);\n    }\n}\n\n// Let&apos;s populate our heap here (data of 2009)\n$heap = new SimpleHeapSort();\n$heap-&gt;insert(&quot;a&quot;);\n$heap-&gt;insert(&quot;b&quot;);\n$heap-&gt;insert(&quot;c&quot;);\n\necho implode(PHP_EOL, iterator_to_array($heap));\n\n\nOutput \n\nc\nb\na\n\n\nSplMaxHeap\n\nThe SplMaxHeap class provides the main functionalities of a heap, keeping the maximum on the top.\n\n$heap = new SplMaxHeap();\n$heap-&gt;insert(1);\n$heap-&gt;insert(2);\n$heap-&gt;insert(3);\n\n\nSplMinHeap\n\n\n  The SplMinHeap class provides the main functionalities of a heap, keeping the minimum on the top.\n\n\n$heap = new SplMinHeap ();\n$heap-&gt;insert(3);\n$heap-&gt;insert(1);\n$heap-&gt;insert(2);\n\n\nOther Types of Sort\n\nBubble Sort\n\nFrom the Wikipedia article on Bubble Sort:\n\n\n  Bubble sort, sometimes incorrectly referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements &quot;bubble&quot; to the top of the list. Because it only uses comparisons to operate on elements, it is a comparison sort. Although the algorithm is simple, most of the other sorting algorithms are more efficient for large lists.\n\n\nfunction bubbleSort(array $array) {\n    $array_size = count($array);\n    for($i = 0; $i &lt; $array_size; $i ++) {\n        for($j = 0; $j &lt; $array_size; $j ++) {\n            if ($array[$i] &lt; $array[$j]) {\n                $tem = $array[$i];\n                $array[$i] = $array[$j];\n                $array[$j] = $tem;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    return $array;\n}\n\n\nSelection sort\n\nFrom the Wikipedia article on Selection sort:\n\n\n  In computer science, selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort. It has O(n2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, and it has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.\n\n\nfunction selectionSort(array $array) {\n    $length = count($array);\n    for($i = 0; $i &lt; $length; $i ++) {\n        $min = $i;\n        for($j = $i + 1; $j &lt; $length; $j ++) {\n            if ($array[$j] &lt; $array[$min]) {\n                $min = $j;\n            }\n        }\n        $tmp = $array[$min];\n        $array[$min] = $array[$i];\n        $array[$i] = $tmp;\n    }\n    return $array;\n}\n\n\nInsertion sort\n\nFrom the Wikipedia article on Insertion sort:\n\n\n  Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. However, insertion sort provides several advantages:\n\n\nfunction insertionSort(array $array) {\n    $count = count($array);\n    for($i = 1; $i &lt; $count; $i ++) {\n\n        $j = $i - 1;\n        // second element of the array\n        $element = $array[$i];\n        while ( $j &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; $array[$j] &gt; $element ) {\n            $array[$j + 1] = $array[$j];\n            $array[$j] = $element;\n            $j = $j - 1;\n        }\n    }\n    return $array;\n}\n\n\nShellsort\n\nFrom the Wikipedia article on Shellsort:\n\n\n  Shellsort, also known as Shell sort or Shell&apos;s method, is an in-place comparison sort. It generalizes an exchanging sort, such as insertion or bubble sort, by starting the comparison and exchange of elements with elements that are far apart before finishing with neighboring elements. \n\n\nfunction shellSort(array $array) {\n    $gaps = array(\n            1,\n            2,\n            3,\n            4,\n            6\n    );\n    $gap = array_pop($gaps);\n    $length = count($array);\n    while ( $gap &gt; 0 ) {\n        for($i = $gap; $i &lt; $length; $i ++) {\n            $tmp = $array[$i];\n            $j = $i;\n            while ( $j &gt;= $gap &amp;&amp; $array[$j - $gap] &gt; $tmp ) {\n                $array[$j] = $array[$j - $gap];\n                $j -= $gap;\n            }\n            $array[$j] = $tmp;\n        }\n        $gap = array_pop($gaps);\n    }\n    return $array;\n}\n\n\nComb sort\n\nFrom the Wikipedia article on Comb sort:\n\n\n  Comb sort is a relatively simple sorting algorithm originally designed by Wlodzimierz Dobosiewicz in 1980. Later it was rediscovered by Stephen Lacey and Richard Box in 1991. Comb sort improves on bubble sort.\n\n\nfunction combSort(array $array) {\n    $gap = count($array);\n    $swap = true;\n    while ( $gap &gt; 1 || $swap ) {\n        if ($gap &gt; 1)\n            $gap /= 1.25;\n        $swap = false;\n        $i = 0;\n        while ( $i + $gap &lt; count($array) ) {\n            if ($array[$i] &gt; $array[$i + $gap]) {\n                // swapping the elements.\n                list($array[$i], $array[$i + $gap]) = array(\n                        $array[$i + $gap],\n                        $array[$i]\n                );\n                $swap = true;\n            }\n            $i ++;\n        }\n    }\n    return $array;\n}\n\n\nMerge sort\n\nFrom the Wikipedia article on Merge sort:\n\n\n  In computer science, a merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an O(n log n) comparison-based sorting algorithm.

This case is trivial and we should have compared the whole string, but let&apos;s assume your use-case is more complicated, such as two consecutive sorts on different fields that shouldn&apos;t cancel out each other&apos;s work.\n\nThe Schwartzian transform\n\nThe Schwartzian transform, also referred to as the decorate-sort-undecorate idiom, effects a stable sort with an inherently unstable sorting algorithm.\n\nFirst, you decorate each array element with another array comprising a primary key (the value) and a secondary key (its index or position):\n\narray_walk($array, function(&amp;$element, $index) {\n    $element = array($element, $index); // decorate\n});\n\n\nThis transforms the array into this:\n\n[\n    [&apos;Kale&apos;, 0], [&apos;Kaleidoscope&apos;, 1], \n    [&apos;Aardvark&apos;, 2], [&apos;Apple&apos;, 3], \n    [&apos;Leicester&apos;, 4], [&apos;Lovely&apos;, 5]\n]\n\n\nNow, we adjust the comparison step; we compare the first letter again, but if they&apos;re the same, the secondary key is used to retain the original ordering:\n\nusort($array, function($a, $b) {\n    // $a[0] and $b[0] contain the primary sort key\n    // $a[1] and $b[1] contain the secondary sort key\n    $tmp = strcmp($a[0][0], $b[0][0]);\n\n    if ($tmp != 0) {\n        return $tmp; // use primary key comparison results\n    }\n\n    return $a[1] - $b[1]; // use secondary key\n});\n\n\nAfterwards, we undecorate:\n\narray_walk($array, function(&amp;$element) {\n    $element = $element[0];\n});\n\n\nThe final result:\n\n[&apos;Aardvark&apos;, &apos;Apple&apos;, &apos;Kale&apos;, &apos;Kaleidoscope&apos;, &apos;Leicester&apos;, &apos;Lovely&apos;]\n\n\nWhat about reuse?\n\nYou had to rewrite your comparison function to work with the transformed array elements; you may not want to edit your delicate comparison functions, so here&apos;s a wrapper for the comparison function:\n\nfunction stablecmp($fn)\n{\n    return function($a, $b) use ($fn) {\n        if (($tmp = call_user_func($fn, $a[0], $b[0])) != 0) {\n            return $tmp;\n        } else {\n            return $a[1] - $b[1];\n        }\n    };\n}\n\n\nLet&apos;s write the sort step using this function:\n\nusort($array, stablecmp(function($a, $b) {\n    return strcmp($a[0], $b[0]);\n}));\n\n\nVoila!

<h1>Basic one dimensional arrays</h1>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$array</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>(<span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">8</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Applicable sort functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sort</code></li>
<li><code>rsort</code></li>
<li><code>asort</code></li>
<li><code>arsort</code></li>
<li><code>natsort</code></li>
<li><code>natcasesort</code></li>
<li><code>ksort</code></li>
<li><code>krsort</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The difference between those is merely whether key-value associations are kept (the "<code>a</code>" functions), whether it sorts low-to-high or reverse ("<code>r</code>"), whether it sorts values or keys ("<code>k</code>") and how it compares values ("<code>nat</code>" vs. normal). See <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/array.sorting.php" rel="noreferrer">http://php.net/manual/en/array.sorting.php</a> for an overview and links to further details.</p>
<h1>Multi dimensional arrays, including arrays of objects</h1>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$array</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>(
    <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-string">'bar'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'baz'</span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-number">42</span>),
    <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span> =&gt; ...,   <span class="hljs-string">'baz'</span> =&gt; ...),
    ...
);
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to sort <code>$array</code> by the key 'foo' of each entry, you need a <em>custom comparison function</em>. The above <code>sort</code> and related functions work on simple values that they know how to compare and sort. PHP does not simply "know" what to do with a <em>complex value</em> like <code>array('foo' =&gt; 'bar', 'baz' =&gt; 42)</code> though; so you need to tell it.</p>
<p>To do that, you need to create a <em>comparison function</em>. That function takes two elements and must return <code>0</code> if these elements are considered equal, a value lower than <code>0</code> if the first value is lower and a value higher than <code>0</code> if the first value is higher. That's all that's needed:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">cmp</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-keyword">array</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span></span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>] &lt; <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>]) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> -<span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
    } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>] &gt; <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>]) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
    } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Often, you will want to use an <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/functions.anonymous.php" rel="noreferrer">anonymous function</a> as the callback. If you want to use a method or static method, see the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.callable.php" rel="noreferrer">other ways of specifying a callback in PHP</a>.</p>
<p>You then use one of these functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://php.net/usort" rel="noreferrer"><code>usort</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://php.net/uasort" rel="noreferrer"><code>uasort</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://php.net/uksort" rel="noreferrer"><code>uksort</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Again, they only differ in whether they keep key-value associations and sort by values or keys. Read their documentation for details.</p>
<p>Example usage:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">usort</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$array</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'cmp'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p><code>usort</code> will take two items from the array and call your <code>cmp</code> function with them. So <code>cmp()</code> will be called with <code>$a</code> as <code>array('foo' =&gt; 'bar', 'baz' =&gt; 42)</code> and <code>$b</code> as another <code>array('foo' =&gt; ..., 'baz' =&gt; ...)</code>. The function then returns to <code>usort</code> which of the values was larger or whether they were equal. <code>usort</code> repeats this process passing different values for <code>$a</code> and <code>$b</code> until the array is sorted. The <code>cmp</code> function will be called many times, <em>at least</em> as many times as there are values in <code>$array</code>, with different combinations of values for <code>$a</code> and <code>$b</code> every time.</p>
<p>To get used to this idea, try this:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">cmp</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span></span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-string">'cmp called with $a:'</span>, PHP_EOL;
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">var_dump</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-string">'and $b:'</span>, PHP_EOL;
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">var_dump</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>All you did was define a custom way to compare two items, that's all you need. That works with all sorts of values.</p>
<p>By the way, this works on any value, the values don't have to be complex arrays. If you have a custom comparison you want to do, you can do it on a simple array of numbers too.</p>
<h3><code>sort</code> sorts by reference and does not return anything useful!</h3>
<p>Note that the array sorts <em>in place</em>, you do not need to assign the return value to anything. <code>$array = sort($array)</code> will replace the array with <code>true</code>, not with a sorted array. Just <code>sort($array);</code> works.</p>
<h2>Custom numeric comparisons</h2>
<p>If you want to sort by the <code>baz</code> key, which is numeric, all you need to do is:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">cmp</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-keyword">array</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span></span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'baz'</span>] - <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'baz'</span>];
}
</code></pre>
<p>Thanks to <strong>The PoWEr oF MATH</strong> this returns a value &lt; 0, 0 or &gt; 0 depending on whether <code>$a</code> is lower than, equal to or larger than <code>$b</code>.</p>
<p>Note that this won't work well for <code>float</code> values, since they'll be reduced to an <code>int</code> and lose precision. Use explicit <code>-1</code>, <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> return values instead.</p>
<h2>Objects</h2>
<p>If you have an array of objects, it works the same way:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">cmp</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span></span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>-&gt;baz - <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>-&gt;baz;
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Functions</h2>
<p>You can do anything you need inside a comparison function, including calling functions:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">cmp</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-keyword">array</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span></span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">someFunction</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'baz'</span>]) - <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">someFunction</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'baz'</span>]);
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Strings</h2>
<p>A shortcut for the first string comparison version:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">cmp</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-keyword">array</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span></span>) </span>{

}
</code></pre>
<p><code>strcmp</code> does exactly what's expected of <code>cmp</code> here, it returns <code>-1</code>, <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.</p>
<h2>Spaceship operator</h2>
<p>PHP 7 introduced the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/31298778/476">spaceship operator</a>, which unifies and simplifies equal/smaller/larger than comparisons across types:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">cmp</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-keyword">array</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span></span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>] &lt;=&gt; <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>];
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Sorting by multiple fields</h2>
<p>If you want to sort primarily by <code>foo</code>, but if <code>foo</code> is equal for two elements sort by <code>baz</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">cmp</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-keyword">array</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span></span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> ((<span class="hljs-variable">$cmp</span> = <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">strcmp</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>], <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>])) !== <span class="hljs-number">0</span>) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$cmp</span>;
    } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'baz'</span>] - <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'baz'</span>];
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>For those familiar, this is equivalent to an SQL query with <code>ORDER BY foo, baz</code>.<br>
Also see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/22812695/476">this very neat shorthand version</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/22829326/476">how to create such a comparison function dynamically for an arbitrary number of keys</a>.</p>
<h2>Sorting into a manual, static order</h2>
<p>If you want to sort elements into a "manual order" like <em>"foo", "bar", "baz"</em>:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">cmp</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-keyword">array</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span></span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-built_in">static</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$order</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'bar'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'baz'</span>);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">array_search</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>], <span class="hljs-variable">$order</span>) - <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">array_search</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>], <span class="hljs-variable">$order</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>For all the above, if you're using PHP 5.3 or higher (and you really should), use anonymous functions for shorter code and to avoid having another global function floating around:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">usort</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$array</span>, function (<span class="hljs-keyword">array</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>) { <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'baz'</span>] - <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'baz'</span>]; });
</code></pre>
<p>That's how simple sorting a complex multi-dimensional array can be. Again, just think in terms of <em>teaching PHP how to tell which of two items is "greater"</em>; let PHP do the actual sorting.</p>
<p>Also for all of the above, to switch between ascending and descending order simply swap the <code>$a</code> and <code>$b</code> arguments around. E.g.:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'baz'</span>] - <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'baz'</span>]; <span class="hljs-comment">// ascending</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'baz'</span>] - <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'baz'</span>]; <span class="hljs-comment">// descending</span>
</code></pre>
<h1>Sorting one array based on another</h1>
<p>And then there's the peculiar <a href="http://php.net/array_multisort" rel="noreferrer"><code>array_multisort</code></a>, which lets you sort one array based on another:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$array1</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>( <span class="hljs-number">4</span>,   <span class="hljs-number">6</span>,   <span class="hljs-number">1</span>);
<span class="hljs-variable">$array2</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>The expected result here would be:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$array2</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>);  <span class="hljs-comment">// the sorted order of $array1</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Use <code>array_multisort</code> to get there:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">array_multisort</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$array1</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$array2</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>As of PHP 5.5.0 you can use <code>array_column</code> to extract a column from a multi dimensional array and sort the array on that column:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">array_multisort</span>(<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">array_column</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$array</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>), SORT_DESC, <span class="hljs-variable">$array</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>You can also sort on more than one column each in either direction:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">array_multisort</span>(<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">array_column</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$array</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>), SORT_DESC,
                <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">array_column</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$array</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'bar'</span>), SORT_ASC,
                <span class="hljs-variable">$array</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>As of PHP 7.0.0 you can also extract properties from an array of objects.</p>

<h2>Other Types of Sort</h2>

<h2>Bubble Sort</h2>

<p>From the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia article on Bubble Sort:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bubble sort, sometimes incorrectly referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list. Because it only uses comparisons to operate on elements, it is a comparison sort. Although the algorithm is simple, most of the other sorting algorithms are more efficient for large lists.</p>

<h2>Selection sort</h2>

<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort" rel="noreferrer">the Wikipedia article on Selection sort:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In computer science, selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort. It has O(n2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, and it has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.</p>

<h2>Merge sort</h2>

<h1>Stable sort</h1>

<p>Let's say you have an array like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">[<span class="hljs-string">'Kale'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Kaleidoscope'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Aardvark'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Apple'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Leicester'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Lovely'</span>]
</code></pre>

<p>And now you want to sort on the first letter only:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">usort</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$array</span>, function(<span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">strcmp</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>], <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]);
});
</code></pre>

<p>The outcome is this:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">[<span class="hljs-string">'Apple'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Aardvark'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Kale'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Kaleidoscope'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Lovely'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Leicester'</span>]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The sort wasn't stable!</strong></p>

<p>The keen observer may have noticed that the array sorting algorithm (QuickSort) didn't produce a stable outcome and that the original order between words of the same first letter wasn't preserved. This case is trivial and we should have compared the whole string, but let's assume your use-case is more complicated, such as two consecutive sorts on different fields that shouldn't cancel out each other's work.</p>

<p><strong>The Schwartzian transform</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwartzian_transform" rel="noreferrer">The Schwartzian transform</a>, also referred to as the decorate-sort-undecorate idiom, effects a stable sort with an inherently unstable sorting algorithm.</p>

<p>First, you decorate each array element with another array comprising a primary key (the value) and a secondary key (its index or position):</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">array_walk</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$array</span>, function(&amp;<span class="hljs-variable">$element</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$index</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-variable">$element</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$element</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$index</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// decorate</span>
});
</code></pre>

<p>This transforms the array into this:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">[
    [<span class="hljs-string">'Kale'</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>], [<span class="hljs-string">'Kaleidoscope'</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>], 
    [<span class="hljs-string">'Aardvark'</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>], [<span class="hljs-string">'Apple'</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>], 
    [<span class="hljs-string">'Leicester'</span>, <span class="hljs-number">4</span>], [<span class="hljs-string">'Lovely'</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>]
]
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we adjust the comparison step; we compare the first letter again, but if they're the same, the secondary key is used to retain the original ordering:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">usort</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$array</span>, function(<span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// $a[0] and $b[0] contain the primary sort key</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// $a[1] and $b[1] contain the secondary sort key</span>
    <span class="hljs-variable">$tmp</span> = <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">strcmp</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>][<span class="hljs-number">0</span>], <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>][<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]);

    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-variable">$tmp</span> != <span class="hljs-number">0</span>) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$tmp</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// use primary key comparison results</span>
    }

    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>] - <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]; <span class="hljs-comment">// use secondary key</span>
});
</code></pre>

<p>Afterwards, we undecorate:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">array_walk</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$array</span>, function(&amp;<span class="hljs-variable">$element</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-variable">$element</span> = <span class="hljs-variable">$element</span>[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>];
});
</code></pre>

<p>The final result:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">[<span class="hljs-string">'Aardvark'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Apple'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Kale'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Kaleidoscope'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Leicester'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Lovely'</span>]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>What about reuse?</strong></p>

<p>You had to rewrite your comparison function to work with the transformed array elements; you may not want to edit your delicate comparison functions, so here's a wrapper for the comparison function:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">stablecmp</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-variable">$fn</span></span>)
</span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span></span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">use</span> (<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-variable">$fn</span></span>) </span>{
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> ((<span class="hljs-variable">$tmp</span> = <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">call_user_func</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$fn</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>], <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>])) != <span class="hljs-number">0</span>) {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$tmp</span>;
        } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>] - <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>];
        }
    };
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let's write the sort step using this function:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">usort</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$array</span>, <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">stablecmp</span>(function(<span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">strcmp</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>], <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]);
}));
</code></pre>

<p>Voila! Your pristine comparison code is back.</p>

<h1>LINQ</h1>

<p>In .NET, LINQ is frequently used for sorting, which provides a much nicer syntax over comparison functions, especially when objects need to be sorted by multiple fields. There're several ports of LINQ to PHP, including <a href="https://github.com/Athari/YaLinqo" rel="nofollow noreferrer">YaLinqo</a> library*. With it, arrays can be sorted with a single line without writing complex comparison functions.</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$sortedByName</span>         = <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$objects</span>)-&gt;<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">orderBy</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'$v-&gt;name'</span>);
<span class="hljs-variable">$sortedByCount</span>        = <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$objects</span>)-&gt;<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">orderBy</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'$v-&gt;count'</span>);
<span class="hljs-variable">$sortedByCountAndName</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$objects</span>)-&gt;<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">orderBy</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'$v-&gt;count'</span>)-&gt;<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">thenBy</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'$v-&gt;name'</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>Comparisons can be further customized by passing a callback as a second argument, for example:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$sortedByFilenameNat</span>  = <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$objects</span>)-&gt;<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">orderBy</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'$v-&gt;filename'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'strnatcmp'</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>'$v-&gt;count'</code> is a shorthand for <code>function ($v) { return $v-&gt;count; }</code> (either can be used). These method chains return iterators, iterators can be transformed to arrays by adding <code>-&gt;toArray()</code> in the end if needed.</p>

<p>Internally, <code>orderBy</code> and related methods call appropriate array sorting functions (<code>uasort</code>, <code>krsort</code>, <code>multisort</code>, <code>usort</code> etc.).</p>

<p>LINQ contains many more methods inspired by SQL: filtering, grouping, joining, aggregating etc. It's best suited for cases when complex transformations on arrays and objects need to be performed without relying on databases.</p>

<p><sub>* developed by me, see readme for more details and comparison with other LINQ ports</sub></p>

<p>This page is very comprehensive, but I want to add a bit more about the awesome utility of the spaceship operator (three way comparison operator) -- a beautiful child of PHP7+.</p>

<h2>Using the spaceship operator to implement multiple sort conditions</h2>

<p>This makes great strides in reducing code bloat and improving readability.</p>

<p>When writing your custom sort (<code>usort()</code>/<code>uasort()</code>/<code>uksort()</code>) function to process a multiple conditions, you only need to write balanced arrays on either side of the operator and return the outcome. <strong>No more nested condition blocks or multiple returns.</strong></p>

<p>The elements from both sides of the operator will be traversed left to right, one at a time, and returning the evaluation as soon as a non-tie is encountered or when the elements have all been compared.</p>

<p>This syntax allows you to sort values, functional outcomes, deep-nested data, and sorting direction in a elegant fashion.  This is definitely worth putting in your php toolbelt ...for cases when you are processing non-database data -- because of course SQL would be a much more sensible technique.</p>

<p>At your own discretion, from PHP7.4 you can use arrow syntax with these anonymous functions.  <a href="https://3v4l.org/N5hs1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Same script with arrow syntax</a>.</p>

<p>There are several ways to sort an array.I will mention some methods for doing that task.fist of all , I will give an integer array which is called as '$numbers'.</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$number</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>(<span class="hljs-number">8</span>,<span class="hljs-number">9</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>,<span class="hljs-number">4</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>This is the normal way to creating an array. Suppose that , I want to sort that array in ascending order.For that, 'sort()' method can be used.</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>

    <span class="hljs-variable">$number</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>(<span class="hljs-number">8</span>,<span class="hljs-number">9</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>,<span class="hljs-number">4</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>);
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">sort</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$number</span>);

   <span class="hljs-keyword">foreach</span> (<span class="hljs-variable">$number</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$value</span>) {
       <span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$value</span>.<span class="hljs-string">"  "</span>;
   }
<span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Now consider the output of that,</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LvIh0.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LvIh0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>You can see printed number array is sorted. If you want to that number array to be sort is descending order, 'rsort()' method can be use for that task.</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>

     <span class="hljs-variable">$number</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>(<span class="hljs-number">8</span>,<span class="hljs-number">9</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>,<span class="hljs-number">4</span>,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>);
     <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">rsort</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$number</span>);

     <span class="hljs-keyword">foreach</span> (<span class="hljs-variable">$number</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$value</span>) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$value</span>.<span class="hljs-string">"  "</span>;
     }
<span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>consider the output..</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N1Pwx.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/N1Pwx.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Now array is sorted in descending order.Ok, Let's consider an associative array.I will give an associative array(Associative array means that, An array whose each index has unique key value.) like this,</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$number</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'eight'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">8</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'nine'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">9</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'three'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">3</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'fore'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">4</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'zero'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'one'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'two'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">2</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>So ,Now I want to sort this array in ascending order according their value.'asort()' method can be used for that.</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>

   <span class="hljs-variable">$number</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'eight'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">8</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'nine'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">9</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'three'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">3</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'fore'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">4</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'zero'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'one'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'two'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">2</span>);
   <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">asort</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$number</span>);

   <span class="hljs-keyword">foreach</span> (<span class="hljs-variable">$number</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$value</span>) {
      <span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$value</span>.<span class="hljs-string">"  "</span>;
    }
<span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>If sorting descending order according their value,'arsort()' method can be used.
Suppose that you want to sort that array according their key value. In this , 'ksort()' method can be use.</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>

     <span class="hljs-variable">$number</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'eight'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">8</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'nine'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">9</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'three'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">3</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'fore'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">4</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'zero'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'one'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'two'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">2</span>);
     <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">ksort</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$number</span>);

     <span class="hljs-keyword">foreach</span> (<span class="hljs-variable">$number</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$value</span>) {

     }
<span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Now consider the output.
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P0zKr.jpg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/P0zKr.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Now array is sorted according their key value.If You want to sort the array in descending order according their key value,'krsort()' method can be used.</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>

    <span class="hljs-variable">$number</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'eight'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">8</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'nine'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">9</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'three'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">3</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'fore'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">4</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'zero'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'one'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'two'</span>=&gt;<span class="hljs-number">2</span>);
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">krsort</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$number</span>);

    <span class="hljs-keyword">foreach</span> (<span class="hljs-variable">$number</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$value</span>) {
       <span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$value</span>.<span class="hljs-string">"  "</span>;
    }
<span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Now associative array is sorted in descending order according their key value.Look at the output.

<p>If someone wants a simpler solution to manipulate arrays, just use Laravel Collection package which has an implemented sortBy function that lets your sort by keys simply.</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$collection</span>-&gt;<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">sortBy</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'forename'</span>)-&gt;<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">sortBy</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'surname'</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>i.e., in order to sort first by a, then b, then c, the correct clause would be</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">sortBy</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>)-&gt;<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">sortBy</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>)-&gt;<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">sortBy</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>)

<p>The simplest is to use usort function to sort array without any looping :
Below is an example :</p>

<p>This will sort in desending order :</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">usort</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$array_compare</span>, function(<span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>) {
