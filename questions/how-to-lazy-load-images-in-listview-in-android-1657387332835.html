<p>I made <a href="https://github.com/thest1/LazyList" rel="noreferrer">a simple demo of a lazy list</a> (located at GitHub) with images. </p>

  <p>Basic Usage </p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vhdl">ImageLoader imageLoader=<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> ImageLoader(<span class="hljs-keyword">context</span>); ...

  <p>Don't forget to add the
  following permissions to your AndroidManifest.xml:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml"> <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">uses-permission</span> <span class="hljs-attr">android:name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"android.permission.INTERNET"</span>/&gt;</span>

</code></pre>
  
  <p>create only one instance of ImageLoader and reuse it all around your
  application. This way image caching will be much more efficient.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It may be helpful to somebody. It downloads images in the background thread. Images are being cached on an SD card and in memory. The cache implementation is very simple and is just enough for the demo. I decode images with inSampleSize to reduce memory consumption. I also try to handle recycled views correctly.</p>

<li>Multithread image loading</li>
<li>Possibility of wide tuning ImageLoader's configuration (thread executors, downloader, decoder, memory and disc cache, display image options, and others)</li>
<li>Possibility of image caching in memory and/or on the device's file system (or SD card)</li>

<p>This is from the Android Developers Blog. The suggested code uses:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>AsyncTasks</code>.</li>
<li>A hard, limited size, <code>FIFO cache</code>.</li>
<li>A soft, easily <code>garbage collect</code>-ed cache.</li>
<li>A <em>placeholder</em> <code>Drawable</code> while you download.</li>

<p><strong>Update: Note that this answer is pretty ineffective now. The Garbage Collector acts aggressively on SoftReference and WeakReference, so this code is NOT suitable for new apps.</strong>  (Instead, try libraries like <a href="https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Universal-Image-Loader" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Universal Image Loader</a> suggested in other answers.)</p>
<p>Thanks to James for the code, and Bao-Long for the suggestion of using SoftReference. I implemented the SoftReference changes on James' code. Unfortunately, SoftReferences caused my images to be garbage collected too quickly. In my case, it was fine without the SoftReference stuff, because my list size is limited and my images are small.</p>
<p>There's a discussion from a year ago regarding the SoftReferences on google groups: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/ebabb0dadf38acc1" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link to thread</a>. As a solution to the too-early garbage collection, they suggest the possibility of manually setting the VM heap size using dalvik.system.VMRuntime.setMinimumHeapSize(), which is not very attractive to me.</p>

<p><strong>Picasso</strong></p>
<p>Use Jake Wharton's  Picasso Library.
(A Perfect ImageLoading Library from the developer of ActionBarSherlock)</p>
<p>A powerful image downloading and caching library for Android.</p>
<p>Images add much-needed context and visual flair to Android applications. Picasso allows for hassle-free image loading in your applicationoften in one line of code!</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp">Picasso.<span class="hljs-keyword">with</span>(context).load(<span class="hljs-string">"http://i.imgur.com/DvpvklR.png"</span>).<span class="hljs-keyword">into</span>(imageView);
</code></pre>
<p>Many common pitfalls of image loading on Android are handled automatically by Picasso:</p>
<p>Handling ImageView recycling and download cancellation in an adapter.
Complex image transformations with minimal memory use.
Automatic memory and disk caching.</p>

<p><strong>Glide</strong></p>
<p>Glide is a fast and efficient open-source media management framework for Android that wraps media decoding, memory and disk caching, and resource pooling into a simple and easy-to-use interface.</p>
<p>Glide supports fetching, decoding, and displaying video stills, images, and animated GIFs. Glide includes a flexible API that allows developers to plug into almost any network stack. By default, Glide uses a custom HttpUrlConnection based stack but also includes utility libraries plug-in to Google's Volley project or Square's OkHttp library instead.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Glide's primary focus is on making scrolling any kind of a list of images as smooth and fast as possible, but Glide is also effective for almost any case where you need to fetch, resize, and display a remote image.</p>

<p><strong>Fresco by Facebook</strong></p>
<p>Fresco is a powerful system for displaying images in Android applications.</p>
<p>Fresco takes care of image loading and display, so you don't have to. It will load images from the network, local storage, or local resources, and display a placeholder until the image has arrived. It has two levels of cache; one in memory and another in internal storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/facebook/fresco" rel="noreferrer">Fresco Github</a></p>
<p>In Android 4.x and lower, Fresco puts images in a special region of Android memory. This lets your application run faster - and suffer the dreaded OutOfMemoryError much less often.</p>

<p>High-performance loader - after examining the methods suggested here,
I used <a href="http://negativeprobability.blogspot.com/2011/08/lazy-loading-of-images-in-listview.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ben's solution</a> with some changes -</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I realized that working with drawable is faster than with bitmaps so I uses drawable instead</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using SoftReference is great, but it makes the cached image to be deleted too often, so I added a Linked list that holds images references, preventing the image to be deleted, until it reached a predefined size</p>
</li>
<li><p>To open the InputStream I used java.net.URLConnection which allows me to use web cache (you need to set a response cache first, but that's another story)</p>

<p>Just a quick tip for someone who is in indecision regarding what library to use for lazy-loading images:</p>

<p>There are four basic ways.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>DIY =&gt; Not the best solution but for a few images and if you want to go without the hassle of using others libraries</p></li>
<li><p>Volley's Lazy Loading library =&gt; From guys at android. It is nice and everything but is poorly documented and hence is a problem to use.</p></li>
<li><p>Picasso: A simple solution that just works, you can even specify the exact image size you want to bring in. It is very simple to use but might not be very "performant" for apps that has to deal with humongous amounts of images.</p></li>
<li><p>UIL: The best way to lazy load images. You can cache images(you need permission of course), initialize the loader once, then have your work done. The most mature asynchronous image loading library I have ever seen so far.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to display Shimmer layout like Facebook there is a official facebook library for that. <a href="http://facebook.github.io/shimmer-android/" rel="noreferrer">FaceBook Shimmer Android</a></p>

<p>It takes care of everything, You just need to put your desired design code in nested manner in shimmer frame.
Here is a sample code.</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">com.facebook.shimmer.ShimmerFrameLayout</span>
     <span class="hljs-attr">android:id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">@+id/shimmer_view_container</span>
     <span class="hljs-attr">android:layout_width</span>=<span class="hljs-string">wrap_content</span>
     <span class="hljs-attr">android:layout_height</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"wrap_content"</span>
     <span class="hljs-attr">shimmer:duration</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"1000"</span>&gt;</span>

 <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">here</span> <span class="hljs-attr">will</span> <span class="hljs-attr">be</span> <span class="hljs-attr">your</span> <span class="hljs-attr">content</span> <span class="hljs-attr">to</span> <span class="hljs-attr">display</span> /&gt;</span>

<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">com.facebook.shimmer.ShimmerFrameLayout</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the java code for it.</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">ShimmerFrameLayout</span> <span class="hljs-variable">shimmerContainer</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> (ShimmerFrameLayout) findViewById(R.id.shimmer_view_container);
shimmerContainer.startShimmerAnimation();
</code></pre>

<p>Add this dependency in your gradle file.</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-delphi"><span class="hljs-keyword">implementation</span> <span class="hljs-string">'com.facebook.shimmer:shimmer:0.1.0@aar'</span>

<p>Check my fork of <a href="https://github.com/nicolasjafelle/LazyList" rel="noreferrer">LazyList</a>. Basically, I improve the LazyList by delaying the call of the ImageView and create two methods:</p>

<ol>
<li>When you need to put something like "Loading image..."</li>
<li>When you need to show the downloaded image.</li>
</ol>

<p>I also improved the ImageLoader by implementing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern" rel="noreferrer">singleton</a> in this object.</p>

<p>All above code have their own worth but with my personal experience just give a try with Picasso.</p>

<p><strong>Picasso</strong>  is a library specifically for this purpose, in-fact it will manage cache and all other network operations automatically.You will have to add library in your project and just write a single line of code to load image from remote URL.</p>

<p>I can recommend a different way that works like a charm: Android Query.</p>

<p>I had this issue and implemented lruCache. I believe you need API 12 and above or use the compatiblity v4 library. lurCache is fast memory, but it also has a budget, so if you're worried about that you can use a diskcache... It's all described in <em><a href="http://developer.android.com/training/displaying-bitmaps/cache-bitmap.html" rel="noreferrer">Caching Bitmaps</a></em>.</p>

<p>I'll now provide my implementation which is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern" rel="noreferrer">singleton</a> I call from anywhere like this:</p>
