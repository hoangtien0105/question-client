Successive characters of the character string literal (including the\n  terminating null character if there is room or if the array is of unknown size) initialize the\n  elements of the array.\n\n\nSo this is just a shortcut for:\n\nchar c[] = {&apos;a&apos;, &apos;b&apos;, &apos;c&apos;, &apos;\\0&apos;};\n\n\nLike any other regular array, c can be modified.\nEverywhere else: it generates an:\n\n\nunnamed\narray of char What is the type of string literals in C and C++?\nwith static storage\nthat gives UB if modified\n\n\nSo when you write:\n\nchar *c = &quot;abc&quot;;\n\n\nThis is similar to:\n\n/* __unnamed is magic because modifying it gives UB. */\nstatic char __unnamed[] = &quot;abc&quot;;\nchar *c = __unnamed;\n\n\nNote the implicit cast from char[] to char *, which is always legal.\n\nThen if you modify c[0], you also modify __unnamed, which is UB.\n\nThis is documented at 6.4.5 &quot;String literals&quot;:\n\n\n  5 In translation phase 7, a byte or code of value zero is appended to each multibyte\n  character sequence that results from a string literal or literals. The multibyte character\n  sequence is then used to initialize an array of static storage duration and length just\n  sufficient to contain the sequence. For character string literals, the array elements have\n  type char, and are initialized with the individual bytes of the multibyte character\n  sequence [...]\n  \n  6 It is unspecified whether these arrays are distinct provided their elements have the\n  appropriate values. If the program attempts to modify such an array, the behavior is\n  undefined.\n\n\n\n6.7.8/32 &quot;Initialization&quot; gives a direct example:\n\n\n  EXAMPLE 8: The declaration\n\nchar s[] = &quot;abc&quot;, t[3] = &quot;abc&quot;;\n\n  \n  defines &quot;plain&quot; char array objects s and t whose elements are initialized with character string literals.\n  \n  This declaration is identical to\n\nchar s[] = { &apos;a&apos;, &apos;b&apos;, &apos;c&apos;, &apos;\\0&apos; },\nt[] = { &apos;a&apos;, &apos;b&apos;, &apos;c&apos; };\n\n  \n  The contents of the arrays are modifiable. On the other hand, the declaration\n\nchar *p = &quot;abc&quot;;\n\n  \n  defines p with type &quot;pointer to char&quot; and initializes it to point to an object with type &quot;array of char&quot; with length 4 whose elements are initialized with a character string literal.

  <p><strong>Q</strong>: What is the difference between these initializations?<br>
  <code>char a[] = "string literal";</code><br>
  <code>char *p  = "string literal";</code><br>
  My program crashes if I try to assign a new value to <code>p[i]</code>.</p>
  
  <p><strong>A</strong>: A string literal (the formal term
  for a double-quoted string in C
  source) can be used in two slightly
  different ways:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>As the initializer for an array of char, as in the declaration of <code>char a[]</code> , it specifies the initial values
  of the characters in that array (and,
  if necessary, its size).</li>
  <li>Anywhere else, it turns into an unnamed, static array of characters,
  and this unnamed array may be stored
  in read-only memory, and which
  therefore cannot necessarily be
  modified. In an expression context,
  the array is converted at once to a
  pointer, as usual (see section 6), so
  the second declaration initializes p
  to point to the unnamed array's first
  element. </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>Some compilers have a switch
  controlling whether string literals
  are writable or not (for compiling old
  code), and some may have options to
  cause string literals to be formally
  treated as arrays of const char (for
  better error catching).</p>

<p>Normally, string literals are stored in read-only memory when the program is run. This is to prevent you from accidentally changing a string constant. In your first example, <code>"string"</code> is stored in read-only memory and <code>*str</code> points to the first character. The segfault happens when you try to change the first character to <code>'z'</code>.</p>

<p>In the second example, the string <code>"string"</code> is <em>copied</em> by the compiler from its read-only home to the <code>str[]</code> array. Then changing the first character is permitted. You can check this by printing the address of each:</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-built_in">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"%p"</span>, str);
</code></pre>

<p>Also, printing the size of <code>str</code> in the second example will show you that the compiler has allocated 7 bytes for it:</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-built_in">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"%d"</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">sizeof</span>(str));

<p>Most of these answers are correct, but just to add a little more clarity...</p>

<p>The "read only memory" that people are referring to is the text segment in ASM terms. It's the same place in memory where the instructions are loaded. This is read-only for obvious reasons like security. When you create a char* initialized to a string, the string data is compiled into the text segment and the program initializes the pointer to point into the text segment. So if you try to change it, kaboom. Segfault.</p>

<p>When written as an array, the compiler places the initialized string data in the data segment instead, which is the same place that your global variables and such live. This memory is mutable, since there are no instructions in the data segment. This time when the compiler initializes the character array (which is still just a char*) it's pointing into the data segment rather than the text segment, which you can safely alter at run-time.</p>

  <p>Why do I get a segmentation fault when writing to a string?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>C99 N1256 draft</strong></p>

<p>There are two different uses of character string literals:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Initialize <code>char[]</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-type">char</span> c[] = <span class="hljs-string">"abc"</span>;      
</code></pre>

<p>This is "more magic", and described at 6.7.8/14 "Initialization":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An array of character type may be initialized by a character string literal, optionally
  enclosed in braces. Successive characters of the character string literal (including the
  terminating null character if there is room or if the array is of unknown size) initialize the
  elements of the array.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this is just a shortcut for:</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-type">char</span> c[] = {<span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'\0'</span>};
</code></pre>

<p>Like any other regular array, <code>c</code> can be modified.</p></li>
<li><p>Everywhere else: it generates an:</p>

<ul>
<li>unnamed</li>
<li>array of char <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2245664/what-is-the-type-of-string-literals-in-c-c">What is the type of string literals in C and C++?</a></li>
<li>with static storage</li>
<li>that gives UB if modified</li>
</ul>

<p>So when you write:</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-type">char</span> *c = <span class="hljs-string">"abc"</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>This is similar to:</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-comment">/* __unnamed is magic because modifying it gives UB. */</span>
<span class="hljs-type">static</span> <span class="hljs-type">char</span> __unnamed[] = <span class="hljs-string">"abc"</span>;
<span class="hljs-type">char</span> *c = __unnamed;
</code></pre>

<p>Note the implicit cast from <code>char[]</code> to <code>char *</code>, which is always legal.</p>

<p>Then if you modify <code>c[0]</code>, you also modify <code>__unnamed</code>, which is UB.</p>

<p>This is documented at 6.4.5 "String literals":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>5 In translation phase 7, a byte or code of value zero is appended to each multibyte
  character sequence that results from a string literal or literals. The multibyte character
  sequence is then used to initialize an array of static storage duration and length just
  sufficient to contain the sequence. For character string literals, the array elements have
  type char, and are initialized with the individual bytes of the multibyte character
  sequence [...]</p>
  
  <p>6 It is unspecified whether these arrays are distinct provided their elements have the
  appropriate values. If the program attempts to modify such an array, the behavior is
  undefined.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>6.7.8/32 "Initialization" gives a direct example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>EXAMPLE 8: The declaration</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-type">char</span> s[] = <span class="hljs-string">"abc"</span>, t[<span class="hljs-number">3</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">"abc"</span>;
</code></pre>
  
  <p>defines "plain" char array objects <code>s</code> and <code>t</code> whose elements are initialized with character string literals.</p>
  
  <p>This declaration is identical to</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-type">char</span> s[] = { <span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'\0'</span> },
t[] = { <span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'c'</span> };
</code></pre>
  
  <p>The contents of the arrays are modifiable. On the other hand, the declaration</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-type">char</span> *p = <span class="hljs-string">"abc"</span>;
</code></pre>
  
  <p>defines <code>p</code> with type "pointer to char" and initializes it to point to an object with type "array of char" with length 4 whose elements are initialized with a character string literal. If an attempt is made to use <code>p</code> to modify the contents of the array, the behavior is undefined.</p>

<p>Conclusion: GCC stores <code>char*</code> it in <code>.rodata</code> section, not in <code>.text</code>.</p>

<p>If we do the same for <code>char[]</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"> <span class="hljs-type">char</span> s[] = <span class="hljs-string">"abc"</span>;

<p>we obtain:</p>

<p>so it gets stored in the stack (relative to <code>%rbp</code>).</p>

<p>Note however that the default linker script puts <code>.rodata</code> and <code>.text</code> in the same segment, which has execute but no write permission. This can be observed with:</p>

<p>Because the type of <code>"whatever"</code> in the context of the 1st example is <code>const char *</code> (even if you assign it to a non-const char*), which means you shouldn't try and write to it.</p>

<p>The compiler has enforced this by putting the string in a read-only part of memory, hence writing to it generates a segfault.</p>

<p>In memory array is stored in continuous memory cells, stored as <code>[h][e][l][l][o][\0] =&gt;[]</code> is 1 char byte size memory cell ,and this continuous memory cells can be access by name named strarray here.so here string array <code>strarray</code> itself containing all characters of string initialized to it.in this case here <code>"hello"</code>
so we can easily change its memory content by accessing each character by its index value</p>
<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c">`strarray[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]=<span class="hljs-string">'m'</span>` it access character at index <span class="hljs-number">0</span> which is <span class="hljs-string">'h'</span>in strarray
</code></pre>
<p>and its value changed to <code>'m'</code> so strarray value changed to <code>"mello"</code>;</p>
<p>one point to note here that we can change the content of string array by changing character by character but can not initialized other string directly to it like <code>strarray="new string"</code> is invalid</p>

<p>As we all know  pointer points to memory location in memory ,
uninitialized pointer points to random memory location so and after initialization points to particular memory location</p>
<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-type">char</span> *ptr = <span class="hljs-string">"hello"</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>here pointer ptr is initialized to string <code>"hello"</code> which is  constant string stored in read only memory (ROM) so <code>"hello"</code> can not be changed as it is stored in ROM</p>
<p>and ptr is stored in stack section and pointing to constant string <code>"hello"</code></p>
<p>so ptr[0]='m' is invalid since you can not access read only memory</p>
<p>But ptr can be initialised to other string value directly since it is just pointer so it can be point to any memory address of variable of its data type</p>
<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c">ptr=<span class="hljs-string">"new string"</span>; is valid

<p>The C FAQ that @matli linked to mentions it, but no one else here has yet, so for clarification: if a string literal (double-quoted string in your source) is used anywhere <em>other than</em> to initialize a character array (ie: @Mark's second example, which works correctly), that string is stored by the compiler in a special <em>static string table</em>, which is akin to creating a global static variable (read-only, of course) that is essentially anonymous (has no variable "name"). The <em>read-only</em> part is the important part, and is why the @Mark's first code example segfaults.</p>

<p>In the first place, <code>str</code> is a pointer that points at <code>"string"</code>.  The compiler is allowed to put string literals in places in memory that you cannot write to, but can only read.  (This really should have triggered a warning, since you're assigning a <code>const char *</code> to a <code>char *</code>.  Did you have warnings disabled, or did you just ignore them?)</p>

<p>In the second place, you're creating an array, which is memory that you've got full access to, and initializing it with <code>"string"</code>.  You're creating a <code>char[7]</code> (six for the letters, one for the terminating '\0'), and you do whatever you like with it.</p>

<p>In the first case, the literal is to be copied when 'a' comes into scope. Here 'a' is an array defined on stack. It means the string will be created on the stack and its data is copied from code (text) memory, which is typically read-only (this is implementation specific, a compiler can place this read-only program data in read-writable memory also).</p>

<p>In the second case, p is a pointer defined on stack (local scope) and referring a string literal (program data or text) stored else where. Usually modifying such memory is not good practice nor encouraged.</p>

<h3>Constant memory</h3>
<p>Since string literals are read-only by design, they are stored in the <strong>Constant part</strong> of memory. Data stored there is immutable, i.e., cannot be changed. Thus, all string literals defined in C code get a read-only memory address here.</p>
<h3>Stack memory</h3>
<p>The <strong>Stack part</strong> of memory is where the addresses of local variables live, e.g., variables defined in functions.</p>

<p>As @matli's answer suggests, there are two ways of working with string these constant strings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When using pointers to string literals as in 1., best practice is to use the <code>const</code> keyword, like <code>const *s = "hello"</code>. This is more readable and the compiler will provide better help when it's violated. It will then throw an error like <code>error: assignment of read-only location *s</code> instead of the seg fault. Linters in editors will also likely pick up the error before you manually compile the code.</p>
