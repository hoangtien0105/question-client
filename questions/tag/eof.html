<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p><code>while(!feof)</code> is wrong because it tests for something that is irrelevant and fails to test for something that you need to know. The result is that you are erroneously executing code that assumes that it is accessing data that was read successfully, when in fact this never happened.</p>
<p>I'd like to provide an abstract, high-level perspective. So continue reading if you're interested in what <code>while(!feof)</code> actually does.</p>
<h3>Concurrency and simultaneity</h3>
<p>I/O operations interact with the environment. The environment is not part of your program, and not under your control. The environment truly exists "concurrently" with your program. As with all things concurrent, questions about the "current state" don't make sense: There is no concept of "simultaneity" across concurrent events. Many properties of state simply don't <em>exist</em> concurrently.</p>
<p>Let me make this more precise: Suppose you want to ask, "do you have more data". You could ask this of a concurrent container, or of your I/O system. But the answer is generally unactionable, and thus meaningless. So what if the container says "yes"  by the time you try reading, it may no longer have data. Similarly, if the answer is "no", by the time you try reading, data may have arrived. The conclusion is that there simply <em>is</em> no property like "I have data", since you cannot act meaningfully in response to any possible answer. (The situation is slightly better with buffered input, where you might conceivably get a "yes, I have data" that constitutes some kind of guarantee, but you would still have to be able to deal with the opposite case. And with output the situation is certainly just as bad as I described: you never know if that disk or that network buffer is full.)</p>
<p>So we conclude that it is impossible, and in fact un<em>reasonable</em>, to ask an I/O system whether it <em>will be</em> able to perform an I/O operation. The only possible way we can interact with it (just as with a concurrent container) is to <em>attempt</em> the operation and check whether it succeeded or failed. At that moment where you interact with the environment, then and only then can you know whether the interaction was actually possible, and at that point you must commit to performing the interaction. (This is a "synchronisation point", if you will.)</p>
<h3>EOF</h3>
<p>Now we get to EOF. EOF is the <em>response</em> you get from an <em>attempted</em> I/O operation. It means that you were trying to read or write something, but when doing so you failed to read or write any data, and instead the end of the input or output was encountered. This is true for essentially all the I/O APIs, whether it be the C standard library, C++ iostreams, or other libraries. As long as the I/O operations succeed, you simply <em>cannot know</em> whether further, future operations will succeed. You <em>must</em> always first try the operation and then respond to success or failure.</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>In each of the examples, note carefully that we <em>first</em> attempt the I/O operation and <em>then</em> consume the result if it is valid. Note further that we <em>always</em> must use the result of the I/O operation, though the result takes different shapes and forms in each example.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>C stdio, read from a file:</p>
<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c">  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (;;) {
      <span class="hljs-type">size_t</span> n = fread(buf, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, bufsize, infile);
      consume(buf, n);
      <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (n == <span class="hljs-number">0</span>) { <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>; }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>The result we must use is <code>n</code>, the number of elements that were read (which may be as little as zero).</p>
</li>
<li><p>C stdio, <code>scanf</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c">  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-type">int</span> a, b, c; <span class="hljs-built_in">scanf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"%d %d %d"</span>, &amp;a, &amp;b, &amp;c) == <span class="hljs-number">3</span>; ) {
      consume(a, b, c);
  }
</code></pre>
<p>The result we must use is the return value of <code>scanf</code>, the number of elements converted.</p>
</li>
<li><p>C++, iostreams formatted extraction:</p>
<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c">  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-type">int</span> n; <span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::<span class="hljs-built_in">cin</span> &gt;&gt; n; ) {
      consume(n);
  }
</code></pre>
<p>The result we must use is <code>std::cin</code> itself, which can be evaluated in a boolean context and tells us whether the stream is still in the <code>good()</code> state.</p>
</li>
<li><p>C++, iostreams getline:</p>
<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c">  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::<span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> line; <span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::getline(<span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::<span class="hljs-built_in">cin</span>, line); ) {
      consume(line);
  }
</code></pre>
<p>The result we must use is again <code>std::cin</code>, just as before.</p>
</li>
<li><p>POSIX, <code>write(2)</code> to flush a buffer:</p>
<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c">  <span class="hljs-type">char</span> <span class="hljs-type">const</span> * p = buf;
  <span class="hljs-type">ssize_t</span> n = bufsize;
  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-type">ssize_t</span> k = bufsize; (k = write(fd, p, n)) &gt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; p += k, n -= k) {}
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (n != <span class="hljs-number">0</span>) { <span class="hljs-comment">/* error, failed to write complete buffer */</span> }
</code></pre>
<p>The result we use here is <code>k</code>, the number of bytes written. The point here is that we can only know how many bytes were written <em>after</em> the write operation.</p>
</li>
<li><p>POSIX <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/getline.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>getline()</code></a></p>
<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c">  <span class="hljs-type">char</span> *buffer = <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span>;
  <span class="hljs-type">size_t</span> bufsiz = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
  <span class="hljs-type">ssize_t</span> nbytes;
  <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> ((nbytes = getline(&amp;buffer, &amp;bufsiz, fp)) != <span class="hljs-number">-1</span>)
  {
      <span class="hljs-comment">/* Use nbytes of data in buffer */</span>
  }
  <span class="hljs-built_in">free</span>(buffer);
</code></pre>
<p>The result we must use is <code>nbytes</code>, the number of bytes up to and including the newline (or EOF if the file did not end with a newline).</p>
<p>Note that the function explicitly returns <code>-1</code> (and not EOF!) when an error occurs or it reaches EOF.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may notice that we very rarely spell out the actual word "EOF". We usually detect the error condition in some other way that is more immediately interesting to us (e.g. failure to perform as much I/O as we had desired). In every example there is some API feature that could tell us explicitly that the EOF state has been encountered, but this is in fact not a terribly useful piece of information. It is much more of a detail than we often care about. What matters is whether the I/O succeeded, more-so than how it failed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A final example that actually queries the EOF state: Suppose you have a string and want to test that it represents an integer in its entirety, with no extra bits at the end except whitespace. Using C++ iostreams, it goes like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c">  <span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::<span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> input = <span class="hljs-string">"   123   "</span>;   <span class="hljs-comment">// example</span>

  <span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::<span class="hljs-built_in">istringstream</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">iss</span><span class="hljs-params">(input)</span>;
  <span class="hljs-type">int</span> value;
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (iss &gt;&gt; value &gt;&gt; <span class="hljs-built_in">std</span>::ws &amp;&amp; iss.get() == EOF) {
      consume(value);
  } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
      <span class="hljs-comment">// error, "input" is not parsable as an integer</span>
  }
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We use two results here. The first is <code>iss</code>, the stream object itself, to check that the formatted extraction to <code>value</code> succeeded. But then, after also consuming whitespace, we perform another I/O/ operation, <code>iss.get()</code>, and expect it to fail as EOF, which is the case if the entire string has already been consumed by the formatted extraction.</p>
<p>In the C standard library you can achieve something similar with the <code>strto*l</code> functions by checking that the end pointer has reached the end of the input string.</p>

The purpose of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;feof()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is NOT to check if the next read will reach the end of file.  The purpose of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;feof()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is to determine the status of a previous read function\nand distinguish between an error condition and the end of the data stream.

In all cases where \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;while(!feof(p))\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is used, there must be at least a check inside the loop for \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ferror()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, or at the very least the while condition should be replaced with \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;while(!feof(p) \u0026amp;amp;\u0026amp;amp; !ferror(p))\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; or there is a very real possibility of an infinite loop, probably spewing all sorts of garbage as invalid data is being processed.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So, in summary, although I cannot state with certainty that there is never a situation in which it may be semantically correct to write \u0026quot;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;while(!feof(f))\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026quot; (although there \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;must\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; be another check inside the loop with a break to avoid a infinite loop on a read error), it is the case that it is almost certainly always wrong.  And even if a case ever arose where it would be correct, it is so idiomatically wrong that it would not be the right way to write the code.  Anyone seeing that code should immediately hesitate and say, \u0026quot;that\u0026apos;s a bug\u0026quot;.  And possibly slap the author (unless the author is your boss in which case discretion is advised.)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;No it\u0026apos;s not always wrong. If your loop condition is \u0026quot;while we haven\u0026apos;t tried to read past end of file\u0026quot; then you use \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;while (!feof(f))\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. This is however not a common loop condition - usually you want to test for something else (such as \u0026quot;can I read more\u0026quot;). \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;while (!feof(f))\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; isn\u0026apos;t wrong, it\u0026apos;s just \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;used\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; wrong.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;feof()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; indicates if one has tried to read past the end of file. That means it has little predictive effect: if it is true, you are sure that the next input operation will fail (you aren\u0026apos;t sure the previous one failed BTW), but if it is false, you aren\u0026apos;t sure the next input operation will succeed.  More over, input operations may fail for other reasons than the end of file (a format error for formatted input, a pure IO failure -- disk failure, network timeout -- for all input kinds), so even if you could be predictive about the end of file (and anybody who has tried to implement Ada one, which is predictive, will tell you it can complex if you need to skip spaces, and that it has undesirable effects on interactive devices -- sometimes forcing the input of the next line before starting the handling of the previous one), you would have to be able to handle a failure.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So the correct idiom in C is to loop with the IO operation success as loop condition, and then test the cause of the failure.

For example, something like this will work if reading from a text file using \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;fgetc()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-c s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-c\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-meta\u0026quot;\u0026gt;#\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;include\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026amp;lt;stdio.h\u0026amp;gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-type\u0026quot;\u0026gt;int\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;main\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-params\u0026quot;\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-type\u0026quot;\u0026gt;int\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; argc, \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-type\u0026quot;\u0026gt;char\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; *argv[])\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n{\n  FILE *in = fopen(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;testfile.txt\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;);\n\n  \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;while\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-number\u0026quot;\u0026gt;1\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;) {\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-type\u0026quot;\u0026gt;char\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; c = fgetc(in);\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;if\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; (feof(in)) \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;break\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;;\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;printf\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;%c\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;, c);\n  }\n\n  fclose(in);\n  \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;return\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-number\u0026quot;\u0026gt;0\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;;\n}\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;It would be great if something like this would work instead:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-c s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-c\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-meta\u0026quot;\u0026gt;#\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;include\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026amp;lt;stdio.h\u0026amp;gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-type\u0026quot;\u0026gt;int\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;main\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-params\u0026quot;\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-type\u0026quot;\u0026gt;int\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; argc, \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-type\u0026quot;\u0026gt;char\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; *argv[])\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n{\n  FILE *in = fopen(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;testfile.txt\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;r\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;);\n\n  \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;while\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(!feof(in)) {\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;printf\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;%c\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;, fgetc(in));\n  }\n\n  fclose(in);\n  \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;return\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-number\u0026quot;\u0026gt;0\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;;\n}\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n    "],"id":39,"title":"Why is “while( !feof(file) )” always wrong?","slug":"why-is-\"while(-!feof(file)-)\"-always-wrong-1657384367349","postType":"QUESTION","createdAt":"2022-07-09T16:32:47.000Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-09T16:32:47.000Z","tags":[{"id":140,"name":"eof","slug":"eof","createdAt":"2022-07-09T16:32:47.000Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-09T16:32:47.000Z","Questions_Tags":{"questionId":39,"tagId":140}}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/questions/tag/[slug]","query":{"slug":"eof"},"buildId":"8pZkyd0U8-Y2Qf3QK9j7l","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
