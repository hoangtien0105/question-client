This is a collection of questions that come up every now and then about syntax in PHP. This is also a Community Wiki, so everyone is invited to participate in maintaining this list.
Why is this?
It used to be hard to find questions about operators and other syntax tokens.¹
The main idea is to have links to existing questions on Stack Overflow, so it&#x27;s easier for us to reference them, not to copy over content from the PHP Manual.
Note: Since January 2013, Stack Overflow does support special characters. Just surround the search terms by quotes, e.g. [php] &quot;==&quot; vs &quot;===&quot;
What should I do here?
If you have been pointed here by someone because you have asked such a question, please find the particular syntax below. The linked pages to the PHP manual along with the linked questions will likely answer your question then. If so, you are encouraged to upvote the answer. This list is not meant as a substitute for the help others provided.

Post-increment creates a special variable, copies there the value of the first variable and only after the first variable is used, replaces its value with second&apos;s.\n\nHowever, you must use $apples--, since first, you want to display the current number of apples, and then you want to subtract one from it.\n\nYou can also increment letters in PHP:\n\n$i = &quot;a&quot;;\nwhile ($i &lt; &quot;c&quot;) {\n    echo $i++;\n}\n\n\nOnce z is reached aa is next, and so on.\n\n\n  Note that character variables can be incremented but not decremented and even so only plain ASCII characters (a-z and A-Z) are supported.\n\n\n\n\nStack Overflow Posts:\n\n\nUnderstanding Incrementing  \n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Bitwise Operator\n\nWhat is a bit?

The first thing that comes up when a conventional programmer thinks of an array (in PHP) would be something similar to:\n$myArray1 = array(2016, &quot;hello&quot;, 33);//option 1\n\n$myArray2 = [2016, &quot;hello&quot;, 33];//option 2\n\n$myArray3 = [];//option 3\n$myArray3[] = 2016; \n$myArray3[] = &quot;hello&quot;; \n$myArray3[] = 33;\n\nWhere as, if we wanted to call the array in some later part of the code, we could do:\necho $myArray1[1];// output: hello\necho $myArray2[1];// output: hello\necho $myArray3[1];// output: hello\n\nSo far so good. However, as humans, we might find it hard to remember that index [0] of the array is the value of the year 2016, index [1] of the array is a greetings, and index [2] of the array is a simple integer value. The alternative we would then have is to use what is called an Associative Array. An Associative array has a few differences from a Sequential Array\n(which is what the previous cases were since they increment the index used in a predetermined sequence, by incrementing by 1 for each following value).\nDifferences (between a sequential and associative array):\n\nDurring the declaration of an Associative Array, you don&apos;t only include the value of what you want to put in the array, but you also put the index value (called the key) which you want to use when calling the array in later parts of the code. The following syntax is used during it&apos;s declaration: &quot;key&quot; =&gt; &quot;value&quot;.\n\nWhen using the Associative Array, the key value would then be placed inside the index of the array to retrieve the desired value.\n\n\nFor instance:\n$myArray1 = array( \n    &quot;Year&quot; =&gt; 2016, \n    &quot;Greetings&quot; =&gt; &quot;hello&quot;, \n    &quot;Integer_value&quot; =&gt; 33);//option 1\n\n$myArray2 = [ \n    &quot;Year&quot; =&gt;  2016, \n    &quot;Greetings&quot; =&gt; &quot;hello&quot;, \n    &quot;Integer_value&quot; =&gt; 33];//option 2\n\n$myArray3 = [];//option 3\n$myArray3[&quot;Year&quot;] = 2016; \n$myArray3[&quot;Greetings&quot;] = &quot;hello&quot;; \n$myArray3[&quot;Integer_value&quot;] = 33;\n\nAnd now, to receive the same output as before, the key value would be used in the arrays index:\necho $myArray1[&quot;Greetings&quot;];// output: hello\necho $myArray2[&quot;Greetings&quot;];// output: hello\necho $myArray3[&quot;Greetings&quot;];// output: hello\n\nFINAL POINT:\nSo from the above example, it is pretty easy to see that the =&gt; symbol is used to express the relationship of an Associative Array between each of the key and value pairs in an array DURING the initiation of the values within the array.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution13","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Question:\n\nWhat does &quot;&amp;&quot; mean here in PHP?\n\nPHP &quot;&amp;&quot; operator\n\nMakes life more easier once we get used to it..(check example below carefully)\n\n&amp; usually checks bits that are set in both $a and $b are set.\n\n\n  have you even noticed how these calls works?\n\n\n   error_reporting(E_ERROR | E_WARNING | E_PARSE);\n    error_reporting(E_ERROR | E_WARNING | E_PARSE | E_NOTICE);\n    error_reporting(E_ALL &amp; ~E_NOTICE);\n    error_reporting(E_ALL);\n\n\nSo behind all above is game of bitwise operator and bits.\n\nOne usefull case of these is easy configurations like give below, so a single integer field can store thousands of combos for you. \n\nMost people have already read the docs but didn&apos;t reliase the real world use case of these bitwise operators.\n\nExample That you &apos;ll love\n\n&lt;?php\n\nclass Config {\n\n    // our constants must be 1,2,4,8,16,32,64 ....so on\n    const TYPE_CAT=1;\n    const TYPE_DOG=2;\n    const TYPE_LION=4;\n    const TYPE_RAT=8;\n    const TYPE_BIRD=16;\n    const TYPE_ALL=31;\n\n    private $config;\n\n    public function __construct($config){\n        $this-&gt;config=$config;\n\n        if($this-&gt;is(Config::TYPE_CAT)){\n            echo &apos;cat &apos;;\n        }\n        if($this-&gt;is(Config::TYPE_DOG)){\n            echo &apos;dog &apos;;\n        }\n        if($this-&gt;is(Config::TYPE_RAT)){\n            echo &apos;rat &apos;;\n        }\n        if($this-&gt;is(Config::TYPE_LION)){\n            echo &apos;lion &apos;;\n        }\n        if($this-&gt;is(Config::TYPE_BIRD)){\n            echo &apos;bird &apos;;\n        }\n        echo &quot;\\n&quot;;\n    }\n\n    private function is($value){\n        return $this-&gt;config &amp; $value;\n    }\n}\n\nnew Config(Config::TYPE_ALL);\n// cat dog rat lion bird\nnew Config(Config::TYPE_BIRD);\n//bird\nnew Config(Config::TYPE_BIRD | Config::TYPE_DOG);\n//dog bird\nnew Config(Config::TYPE_ALL &amp; ~Config::TYPE_DOG &amp; ~Config::TYPE_CAT);\n//rat lion bird\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution14","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"==  is used for check equality without considering variable data-type\n=== is used for check equality for both the variable value and data-type\nExample\n$a = 5\n\nif ($a == 5)  - will evaluate to true\n\nif ($a == &apos;5&apos;) - will evaluate to true, because while comparing this both value PHP internally convert that string value into integer and then compare both values\n\nif ($a === 5) - will evaluate to true\n\nif ($a === &apos;5&apos;) - will evaluate to false, because value is 5, but this value 5 is not an integer.\n\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution15","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Null Coalesce operator &quot;??&quot; (Added in PHP 7)\n\nNot the catchiest name for an operator, but PHP 7 brings in the rather handy null coalesce so I thought I&apos;d share an example.\n\nIn PHP 5, we already have a ternary operator, which tests a value, and then returns the second element if that returns true and the third if it doesn&apos;t:\n\necho $count ? $count : 10; // outputs 10\n\n\nThere is also a shorthand for that which allows you to skip the second element if it&apos;s the same as the first one: echo $count ?: 10; // also outputs 10\n\nIn PHP 7 we additionally get the ?? operator which rather than indicating extreme confusion which is how I would usually use two question marks together instead allows us to chain together a string of values.

<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>This is a collection of questions that come up every now and then about syntax in PHP. This is also a Community Wiki, so everyone is invited to participate in maintaining this list.</p>
<h3>Why is this?</h3>
<p>It used to be hard to find questions about operators and other syntax tokens.¹<br>
The main idea is to have links to existing questions on Stack Overflow, so it's easier for us to reference them, not to copy over content from the PHP Manual.</p>
<p>Note: Since January 2013, Stack Overflow <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/160100/a-new-search-engine-for-stack-exchange">does support special characters</a>. Just surround the search terms by quotes, e.g. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=%5Bphp%5D%20%22===%22%20vs%20%22==%22"><code>[php] "==" vs "==="</code></a></p>
<h3><strong>What should I do here?</strong></h3>
<p>If you have been pointed here by someone because you have asked such a question, please find the particular syntax below. The linked pages to the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/index.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PHP manual</a> along with the linked questions will likely answer your question then. If so, you are encouraged to upvote the answer. This list is not meant as a substitute for the help others provided.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.increment.php" rel="noreferrer">Incrementing / Decrementing Operators</a></strong></p>

<p><code>++</code> increment operator</p>

<p><code>--</code> decrement operator</p>

<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>Example    Name              Effect
---------------------------------------------------------------------
++$a       Pre-increment     Increments $a by one, then returns $a.
$a++       Post-increment    Returns $a, then increments $a by one.
--$a       Pre-decrement     Decrements $a by one, then returns $a.
$a--       Post-decrement    Returns $a, then decrements $a by one.
</code></pre>

<p>These can go before or after the variable.</p>

<p>If put before the variable, the increment/decrement operation is done to the variable <strong>first</strong> then the result is returned. If put after the variable, the variable is <strong>first</strong> returned, then the increment/decrement operation is done.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$apples</span> = <span class="hljs-number">10</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-variable">$i</span> = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; <span class="hljs-variable">$i</span> &lt; <span class="hljs-number">10</span>; ++<span class="hljs-variable">$i</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-string">'I have '</span> . <span class="hljs-variable">$apples</span>-- . <span class="hljs-string">" apples. I just ate one.\n"</span>;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong><a href="http://codepad.org/5ZD3j0xb" rel="noreferrer">Live example</a></strong></p>

<p>In the case above <code>++$i</code> is used, since it is faster. <code>$i++</code> would have the same results.</p>

<p>Pre-increment is a little bit faster because it really increments the variable and after that 'returns' the result. Post-increment creates a special variable, copies there the value of the first variable and only after the first variable is used, replaces its value with second's.</p>

<p>However, you must use <code>$apples--</code>, since first, you want to display the current number of apples, and <strong>then</strong> you want to subtract one from it.</p>

<p>You can also increment letters in PHP:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$i</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"a"</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> (<span class="hljs-variable">$i</span> &lt; <span class="hljs-string">"c"</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$i</span>++;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once <code>z</code> is reached <code>aa</code> is next, and so on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that character variables can be incremented but not decremented and even so only plain ASCII characters (a-z and A-Z) are supported.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Bitwise Operator</h1>

<p>What is a bit? A bit is a representation of 1 or 0. Basically OFF(0) and ON(1)</p>

<p>What is a byte? A byte is made up of 8 bits and the highest value of a byte is 255, which would mean every bit is set. We will look at why a byte's maximum value is 255.</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">-------------------------------------------
|      <span class="hljs-number">1</span> <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">Byte</span> ( <span class="hljs-number">8</span> bits )                  |
-------------------------------------------
|Place Value | <span class="hljs-number">128</span>| <span class="hljs-number">64</span>| <span class="hljs-number">32</span>| <span class="hljs-number">16</span>| <span class="hljs-number">8</span>| <span class="hljs-number">4</span>| <span class="hljs-number">2</span>| <span class="hljs-number">1</span>|     
-------------------------------------------
</code></pre>

<p>This representation of 1 Byte</p>

<p>1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 255 (1 Byte) </p>

<h1>A few examples for better understanding</h1>

<h2>The "AND" operator: <code>&amp;</code></h2>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$a</span> =  <span class="hljs-number">9</span>;
<span class="hljs-variable">$b</span> = <span class="hljs-number">10</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span> &amp; <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>This would output the number 8. Why? Well let's see using our table example.</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">-------------------------------------------
|      <span class="hljs-number">1</span> <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">Byte</span> ( <span class="hljs-number">8</span> bits )                  |
-------------------------------------------
|Place Value | <span class="hljs-number">128</span>| <span class="hljs-number">64</span>| <span class="hljs-number">32</span>| <span class="hljs-number">16</span>| <span class="hljs-number">8</span>| <span class="hljs-number">4</span>| <span class="hljs-number">2</span>| <span class="hljs-number">1</span>|     
-------------------------------------------
|      <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>    |   <span class="hljs-number">0</span>|  <span class="hljs-number">0</span>|  <span class="hljs-number">0</span>|  <span class="hljs-number">0</span>| <span class="hljs-number">1</span>| <span class="hljs-number">0</span>| <span class="hljs-number">0</span>| <span class="hljs-number">1</span>|    
-------------------------------------------
|      <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>    |   <span class="hljs-number">0</span>|  <span class="hljs-number">0</span>|  <span class="hljs-number">0</span>|  <span class="hljs-number">0</span>| <span class="hljs-number">1</span>| <span class="hljs-number">0</span>| <span class="hljs-number">1</span>| <span class="hljs-number">0</span>|
------------------------------------------- 
|      &amp;     |   <span class="hljs-number">0</span>|  <span class="hljs-number">0</span>|  <span class="hljs-number">0</span>|  <span class="hljs-number">0</span>| <span class="hljs-number">1</span>| <span class="hljs-number">0</span>| <span class="hljs-number">0</span>| <span class="hljs-number">0</span>|
------------------------------------------- 
</code></pre>

<p>So you can see from the table the only bit they share together is the 8 bit.</p>

<p><strong>Second example</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$a</span> =  <span class="hljs-number">36</span>;
<span class="hljs-variable">$b</span> = <span class="hljs-number">103</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span> &amp; <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// This would output the number 36.</span>
<span class="hljs-variable">$a</span> = <span class="hljs-number">00100100</span>
<span class="hljs-variable">$b</span> = <span class="hljs-number">01100111</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The two shared bits are 32 and 4, which when added together return 36.</p>

<h2>The "Or" operator: <code>|</code></h2>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$a</span> =  <span class="hljs-number">9</span>;
<span class="hljs-variable">$b</span> = <span class="hljs-number">10</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span> | <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>This would output the number 11. Why?</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">-------------------------------------------
|      <span class="hljs-number">1</span> <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">Byte</span> ( <span class="hljs-number">8</span> bits )                  |

-------------------------------------------
</code></pre>

<p>You will notice that we have 3 bits set, in the 8, 2, and 1 columns. Add those up: 8+2+1=11.</p>

<h1><code>&lt;=&gt;</code> Spaceship Operator</h1>
<h3>Added in PHP 7</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://php.net/language.operators.comparison" rel="noreferrer">spaceship operator</a> <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> is the latest comparison operator added in PHP 7. It is a <em>non-associative</em> binary operator with the same precedence as equality operators (<code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>===</code>, <code>!==</code>). This operator allows for simpler three-way comparison between left-hand and right-hand operands.</p>
<p>The operator results in an integer expression of:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0</code> when both operands are equal</li>
<li>Less than <code>0</code> when the left-hand operand is less than the right-hand operand</li>
<li>Greater than <code>0</code> when the left-hand operand is greater than the right-hand operand</li>
</ul>
<p>e.g.</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-number">1</span> &lt;=&gt; <span class="hljs-number">1</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// 0</span>
<span class="hljs-number">1</span> &lt;=&gt; <span class="hljs-number">2</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// -1</span>
<span class="hljs-number">2</span> &lt;=&gt; <span class="hljs-number">1</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// 1</span>
</code></pre>
<p>A good practical application of using this operator would be in comparison type callbacks that are expected to return a zero, negative, or positive integer based on a three-way comparison between two values. The comparison function passed to <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.usort.php" rel="noreferrer"><code>usort</code></a> is one such example.</p>
<h3>Before PHP 7 you would write...</h3>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$arr</span> = [<span class="hljs-number">4</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>,<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>];

<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">usort</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$arr</span>, function (<span class="hljs-variable">$a</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-variable">$a</span> &lt; <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> -<span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
    } <span class="hljs-keyword">elseif</span> (<span class="hljs-variable">$a</span> &gt; <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span>) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
    } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
    }
});
</code></pre>
<h3>Since PHP 7 you can write...</h3>

<p><strong>Magic constants</strong>: Although these are not just symbols but important part of this token family. There are eight magical constants that change depending on where they are used.</p>

<p><code>__LINE__</code>: The current line number of the file.</p>

<p><code>__FILE__</code>: The full path and filename of the file. If used inside an include, the name of the included file is returned. Since PHP 4.0.2, <code>__FILE__</code> always contains an absolute path with symlinks resolved whereas in older versions it contained relative path under some circumstances.</p>

<p><code>__DIR__</code>: The directory of the file. If used inside an include, the directory of the included file is returned. This is equivalent to <code>dirname(__FILE__)</code>. This directory name does not have a trailing slash unless it is the root directory. (Added in PHP 5.3.0.)</p>

<p><code>__FUNCTION__</code>: The function name. (Added in PHP 4.3.0) As of PHP 5 this constant returns the function name as it was declared (case-sensitive). In PHP 4 its value is always lowercased.</p>

<p><code>__CLASS__</code>: The class name. (Added in PHP 4.3.0) As of PHP 5 this constant returns the class name as it was declared (case-sensitive). In PHP 4 its value is always lowercased. The class name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. <code>Foo\Bar</code>). Note that as of PHP 5.4 <code>__CLASS__</code> works also in traits. When used in a trait method, <code>__CLASS__</code> is the name of the class the trait is used in.</p>

<p><code>__TRAIT__</code>: The trait name. (Added in PHP 5.4.0) As of PHP 5.4 this constant returns the trait as it was declared (case-sensitive). The trait name includes the namespace it was declared in (e.g. <code>Foo\Bar</code>).</p>

<p><code>__METHOD__</code>: The class method name. (Added in PHP 5.0.0) The method name is returned as it was declared (case-sensitive).</p>

<p><code>__NAMESPACE__</code>: The name of the current namespace (case-sensitive). This constant is defined in compile-time (Added in PHP 5.3.0).</p>

<h1>Type Operators</h1>

<p><code>instanceof</code> is used to determine whether a PHP variable is an instantiated object of a certain class.</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">mclass</span> </span>{ }

<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">var_dump</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$a</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">instanceof</span> mclass);
<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">var_dump</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$a</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">instanceof</span> sclass);
</code></pre>

<p>The above example will output:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-keyword">bool</span>(<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">bool</span>(<span class="hljs-literal">false</span>)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Reason:</strong> Above Example <code>$a</code> is a object of the <code>mclass</code> so use only a <code>mclass</code> data not instance of with the <code>sclass</code></p>

<h2>Example with inheritance</h2>

<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">var_dump</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$a</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">instanceof</span> pclass);
</code></pre>

<p>The above example will output:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-keyword">bool</span>(<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">bool</span>(<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>)

<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong></p>
<p>What does <code>=&gt;</code> mean?</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong></p>
<p><code>=&gt;</code> Is the symbol we humans decided to use to separate <code>"Key" =&gt; "Value"</code> pairs in Associative Arrays.</p>
<p><strong>ELABORATING:</strong></p>
<p>To understand this, we have to know what Associative Arrays are. The first thing that comes up when a conventional programmer thinks of an array (<strong>in PHP</strong>) would be something similar to:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$myArray1</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>(<span class="hljs-number">2016</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"hello"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">33</span>);<span class="hljs-comment">//option 1</span>

<span class="hljs-variable">$myArray2</span> = [<span class="hljs-number">2016</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"hello"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">33</span>];<span class="hljs-comment">//option 2</span>

<span class="hljs-variable">$myArray3</span> = [];<span class="hljs-comment">//option 3</span>
<span class="hljs-variable">$myArray3</span>[] = <span class="hljs-number">2016</span>; 
<span class="hljs-variable">$myArray3</span>[] = <span class="hljs-string">"hello"</span>; 
<span class="hljs-variable">$myArray3</span>[] = <span class="hljs-number">33</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>Where as, if we wanted to call the array in some later part of the code, we could do:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$myArray1</span>[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>];<span class="hljs-comment">// output: hello</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$myArray2</span>[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>];<span class="hljs-comment">// output: hello</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$myArray3</span>[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>];<span class="hljs-comment">// output: hello</span>
</code></pre>
<p>So far so good. However, as humans, we might find it hard to remember that index <code>[0]</code> of the array is the value of the <strong>year</strong> 2016, index <code>[1]</code> of the array is a <strong>greetings</strong>, and index <code>[2]</code> of the array is a simple <strong>integer value</strong>. The alternative we would then have is to use what is called an <strong>Associative Array</strong>. An Associative array has a few differences from a <strong>Sequential Array</strong>
(<em>which is what the previous cases were since they increment the index used in a predetermined sequence, by incrementing by 1 for each following value</em>).</p>
<p>Differences (<em>between a sequential and associative array</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Durring the declaration of an Associative Array, you don't only include the <code>value</code> of what you want to put in the array, but you also put the index value (called the <code>key</code>) which you want to use when calling the array in later parts of the code. The following syntax is used during it's declaration: <code>"key" =&gt; "value"</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When using the Associative Array, the <code>key</code> value would then be placed inside the index of the array to retrieve the desired <code>value</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$myArray1</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>( 
    <span class="hljs-string">"Year"</span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-number">2016</span>, 
    <span class="hljs-string">"Greetings"</span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-string">"hello"</span>, 
    <span class="hljs-string">"Integer_value"</span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-number">33</span>);<span class="hljs-comment">//option 1</span>

<span class="hljs-variable">$myArray2</span> = [ 
    <span class="hljs-string">"Year"</span> =&gt;  <span class="hljs-number">2016</span>, 
    <span class="hljs-string">"Greetings"</span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-string">"hello"</span>, 
    <span class="hljs-string">"Integer_value"</span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-number">33</span>];<span class="hljs-comment">//option 2</span>

<span class="hljs-variable">$myArray3</span> = [];<span class="hljs-comment">//option 3</span>
<span class="hljs-variable">$myArray3</span>[<span class="hljs-string">"Year"</span>] = <span class="hljs-number">2016</span>; 
<span class="hljs-variable">$myArray3</span>[<span class="hljs-string">"Greetings"</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">"hello"</span>; 
<span class="hljs-variable">$myArray3</span>[<span class="hljs-string">"Integer_value"</span>] = <span class="hljs-number">33</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>And now, to receive the same output as before, the <code>key</code> value would be used in the arrays index:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$myArray1</span>[<span class="hljs-string">"Greetings"</span>];<span class="hljs-comment">// output: hello</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$myArray2</span>[<span class="hljs-string">"Greetings"</span>];<span class="hljs-comment">// output: hello</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$myArray3</span>[<span class="hljs-string">"Greetings"</span>];<span class="hljs-comment">// output: hello</span>
</code></pre>
<p><strong>FINAL POINT:</strong></p>
<p>So from the above example, it is pretty easy to see that the <code>=&gt;</code> symbol is used to express the relationship of an Associative Array between each of the <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> pairs in an array <strong>DURING</strong> the initiation of the values within the array.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>

<p>What does "&amp;" mean here in PHP?</p>

<h1><strong>PHP "&amp;" operator</strong></h1>

<p>Makes life more easier once we get used to it..(check example below carefully)</p>

<p><strong>&amp;</strong> usually checks bits that are set in both $a and $b are set.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>have you even noticed how these calls works?</p>
</blockquote>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">   <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">error_reporting</span>(E_ERROR | E_WARNING | E_PARSE);
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">error_reporting</span>(E_ERROR | E_WARNING | E_PARSE | E_NOTICE);
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">error_reporting</span>(E_ALL &amp; ~E_NOTICE);
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">error_reporting</span>(E_ALL);
</code></pre>

<p>So behind all above is game of bitwise operator and bits.</p>

<p>One usefull case of these is easy configurations like give below, so a single integer field can store thousands of combos for you. </p>

<p>Most people have already read the docs but didn't reliase the real world use case of these bitwise operators.</p>

<h2>Null Coalesce operator "??" (Added in PHP 7)</h2>

<p>Not the catchiest name for an operator, but PHP 7 brings in the rather handy null coalesce so I thought I'd share an example.</p>

<p>In PHP 5, we already have a ternary operator, which tests a value, and then returns the second element if that returns true and the third if it doesn't:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$count</span> ? <span class="hljs-variable">$count</span> : <span class="hljs-number">10</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// outputs 10</span>
</code></pre>

<p>There is also a shorthand for that which allows you to skip the second element if it's the same as the first one: echo $count ?: 10; // also outputs 10</p>

<p>In PHP 7 we additionally get the ?? operator which rather than indicating extreme confusion which is how I would usually use two question marks together instead allows us to chain together a string of values. Reading from left to right, the first value which exists and is not null is the value that will be returned.</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-comment">// $a is not set</span>
<span class="hljs-variable">$b</span> = <span class="hljs-number">16</span>;

<span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span> ?? <span class="hljs-number">2</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// outputs 2</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-variable">$a</span> ?? <span class="hljs-variable">$b</span> ?? <span class="hljs-number">7</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// outputs 16</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This construct is useful for giving priority to one or more values coming perhaps from user input or existing configuration, and safely falling back on a given default if that configuration is missing. It's kind of a small feature but it's one that I know I'll be using as soon as my applications upgrade to PHP 7.</p>

<h2>Nullable return type declaration</h2>

<p>PHP 7 adds support for return type declarations. Similarly to argument type declarations, return type declarations specify the type of value that will be returned from a function. The same types are available for return type declarations as are available for argument type declarations.</p>

<p>Strict typing also has an effect on return type declarations. In the default weak mode, returned values will be coerced to the correct type if they are not already of that type. In strong mode, the returned value must be of the correct type, otherwise, a TypeError will be thrown.</p>

<p><strong>As of PHP 7.1.0, return values can be marked as nullable by prefixing the type name with a question mark (?). This signifies that the function returns either the specified type or NULL.</strong></p>

<p><strong>PHP Arrays:</strong></p>
<p>An <code>array</code> is a data structure that stores one or more similar types of values in a single value:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Numeric array  An <code>array</code> with a numeric index. Values are stored and accessed in linear fashion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Associative array  An <code>array</code> with strings as index. This stores element values in association with key-values rather than in a strict linear index order.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multidimensional array  An <code>array</code> containing one or more arrays, and values are accessed using multiple indices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Numeric Array</h4>
<p>These arrays can store numbers, strings and any object but their index will be represented by numbers. By default, an array's index starts from zero.</p>

<h3>#[] attributes since PHP 8</h3>
<p>You can write <code>#[attribute_name]</code> since PHP 8.  This is an <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.attributes.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">attribute</a> in PHP (also Rust and C#).  Other languages may use names like annotations (Java) or decorators (Python, Javascript) for a similar feature.  Prior to PHP 8, <code>#[whatever]</code> would have been a comment until the end of the line (because <code>#</code> starts a comment in PHP).  So if an attribute is the last thing on a line, it will be ignored in versions before PHP 8.  If not the last thing on a line, it would comment out whatever was after it prior to PHP 8 (since then the <code>]</code> terminates it).</p>

<p><strong>In php 8</strong></p>
<p>Instead of writing the classic <code>!== null</code> you can use the <code>?</code> operator to write just 1 line of code, the code becomes pretty clear:</p>
