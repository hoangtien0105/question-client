Is this possible? Is a full outer join supported by MySQL?\n    ","answerCount":15,"upVoteCount":500,"suggestedAnswer":[{"text":"You don&apos;t have full joins in MySQL, but you can sure emulate them.\nFor a code sample transcribed from this Stack Overflow question you have:\nWith two tables t1, t2:\nSELECT * FROM t1\nLEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id\nUNION\nSELECT * FROM t1\nRIGHT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id\n\n\nThe query above works for special cases where a full outer join operation would not produce any duplicate rows. The query above depends on the UNION set operator to remove duplicate rows introduced by the query pattern.  We can avoid introducing duplicate rows by using an anti-join pattern for the second query, and then use a UNION ALL set operator to combine the two sets. In the more general case, where a full outer join would return duplicate rows, we can do this:\nSELECT * FROM t1\nLEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id\nUNION ALL\nSELECT * FROM t1\nRIGHT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id\nWHERE t1.id IS NULL\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"The answer that Pablo Santa Cruz gave is correct; however, in case anybody stumbled on this page and wants more clarification, here is a detailed breakdown.\n\nExample Tables\n\nSuppose we have the following tables:\n\n-- t1\nid  name\n1   Tim\n2   Marta\n\n-- t2\nid  name\n1   Tim\n3   Katarina\n\n\nInner Joins\n\nAn inner join, like this:\n\nSELECT *\nFROM `t1`\nINNER JOIN `t2` ON `t1`.`id` = `t2`.`id`;\n\n\nWould get us only records that appear in both tables, like this:\n\n1 Tim  1 Tim\n\n\nInner joins don&apos;t have a direction (like left or right) because they are explicitly bidirectional - we require a match on both sides.\n\nOuter Joins\n\nOuter joins, on the other hand, are for finding records that may not have a match in the other table. As such, you have to specify which side of the join is allowed to have a missing record.\n\nLEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN are shorthand for LEFT OUTER JOIN and RIGHT OUTER JOIN; I will use their full names below to reinforce the concept of outer joins vs inner joins.\n\nLeft Outer Join\n\nA left outer join, like this:\n\nSELECT *\nFROM `t1`\nLEFT OUTER JOIN `t2` ON `t1`.`id` = `t2`.`id`;\n\n\n...would get us all the records from the left table regardless of whether or not they have a match in the right table, like this:\n\n1 Tim   1    Tim\n2 Marta NULL NULL\n\n\nRight Outer Join\n\nA right outer join, like this:\n\nSELECT *\nFROM `t1`\nRIGHT OUTER JOIN `t2` ON `t1`.`id` = `t2`.`id`;\n\n\n...would get us all the records from the right table regardless of whether or not they have a match in the left table, like this:\n\n1    Tim   1  Tim\nNULL NULL  3  Katarina\n\n\nFull Outer Join\n\nA full outer join would give us all records from both tables, whether or not they have a match in the other table, with NULLs on both sides where there is no match. The result would look like this:\n\n1    Tim   1    Tim\n2    Marta NULL NULL\nNULL NULL  3    Katarina\n\n\nHowever, as Pablo Santa Cruz pointed out, MySQL doesn&apos;t support this. We can emulate it by doing a UNION of a left join and a right join, like this:\n\nSELECT *\nFROM `t1`\nLEFT OUTER JOIN `t2` ON `t1`.`id` = `t2`.`id`\n\nUNION\n\nSELECT *\nFROM `t1`\nRIGHT OUTER JOIN `t2` ON `t1`.`id` = `t2`.`id`;\n\n\nYou can think of a UNION as meaning &quot;run both of these queries, then stack the results on top of each other&quot;; some of the rows will come from the first query and some from the second.\n\nIt should be noted that a UNION in MySQL will eliminate exact duplicates: Tim would appear in both of the queries here, but the result of the UNION only lists him once. My database guru colleague feels that this behavior should not be relied upon. So to be more explicit about it, we could add a WHERE clause to the second query:\n\nSELECT *\nFROM `t1`\nLEFT OUTER JOIN `t2` ON `t1`.`id` = `t2`.`id`\n\nUNION\n\nSELECT *\nFROM `t1`\nRIGHT OUTER JOIN `t2` ON `t1`.`id` = `t2`.`id`\nWHERE `t1`.`id` IS NULL;\n\n\nOn the other hand, if you wanted to see duplicates for some reason, you could use UNION ALL.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Using a union query will remove duplicates, and this is different than the behavior of full outer join that never removes any duplicates:\n[Table: t1]        [Table: t2]\nvalue              value\n-----------        -------\n1                  1\n2                  2\n4                  2\n4                  5\n\nThis is the expected result of a full outer join:\nvalue | value\n------+-------\n1     | 1\n2     | 2\n2     | 2\nNull  | 5\n4     | Null\n4     | Null\n\nThis is the result of using left and right join with union:\nvalue | value\n------+-------\nNull  | 5\n1     | 1\n2     | 2\n4     | Null\n\nSQL Fiddle\nMy suggested query is:\nselect\n    t1.value, t2.value\nfrom t1\nleft outer join t2\n  on t1.value = t2.value\nunion all      -- Using `union all` instead of `union`\nselect\n    t1.value, t2.value\nfrom t2\nleft outer join t1\n  on t1.value = t2.value\nwhere\n    t1.value IS NULL\n\nThe result of the above query that is as the same as the expected result:\nvalue | value\n------+-------\n1     | 1\n2     | 2\n2     | 2\n4     | NULL\n4     | NULL\nNULL  | 5\n\nSQL Fiddle\n\n\n@Steve Chambers: [From comments, with many thanks!]\n\nNote: This may be the best solution, both for efficiency and for generating the same results as a FULL OUTER JOIN. This blog post also explains it well - to quote from Method 2: &quot;This handles duplicate rows correctly and doesnt include anything it shouldnt. Its necessary to use UNION ALL instead of plain UNION, which would eliminate the duplicates I want to keep. This may be significantly more efficient on large result sets, since theres no need to sort and remove duplicates.&quot;\n\nI decided to add another solution that comes from full outer join visualization and math. It is not better than the above, but it is more readable:\n\nFull outer join means (t1  t2): all in t1 or in t2\n(t1  t2) = (t1  t2) + t1_only + t2_only: all in both t1 and t2 plus all in t1 that aren&apos;t in t2 and plus all in t2 that aren&apos;t in t1:\n\n-- (t1  t2): all in both t1 and t2\nselect t1.value, t2.value\nfrom t1 join t2 on t1.value = t2.value\nunion all  -- And plus\n-- all in t1 that not exists in t2\nselect t1.value, null\nfrom t1\nwhere not exists( select 1 from t2 where t2.value = t1.value)\nunion all  -- and plus\n-- all in t2 that not exists in t1\nselect null, t2.value\nfrom t2\nwhere not exists( select 1 from t1 where t2.value = t1.value)\n\nSQL Fiddle\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"MySQL does not have FULL-OUTER-JOIN syntax. You have to emulate it by doing both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN as follows:\nSELECT * FROM t1\nLEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id\nUNION\nSELECT * FROM t1\nRIGHT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id\n\nBut MySQL also does not have a RIGHT JOIN syntax. According to MySQL&apos;s outer join simplification, the right join is converted to the equivalent left join by switching the t1 and t2 in the FROM and ON clause in the query. Thus, the MySQL query optimizer translates the original query into the following -\nSELECT * FROM t1\nLEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id\nUNION\nSELECT * FROM t2\nLEFT JOIN t1 ON t2.id = t1.id\n\nNow, there is no harm in writing the original query as is, but say if you have predicates like the WHERE clause, which is a before-join predicate or an AND predicate on the ON clause, which is a during-join predicate, then you might want to take a look at the devil; which is in details.\nThe MySQL query optimizer routinely checks the predicates if they are null-rejected.\n\nNow, if you have done the RIGHT JOIN, but with WHERE predicate on the column from t1, then you might be at a risk of running into a null-rejected scenario.\nFor example, the query\nSELECT * FROM t1\nLEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id\nWHERE t1.col1 = &apos;someValue&apos;\nUNION\nSELECT * FROM t1\nRIGHT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id\nWHERE t1.col1 = &apos;someValue&apos;\n\ngets translated to the following by the query optimizer:\nSELECT * FROM t1\nLEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id\nWHERE t1.col1 = &apos;someValue&apos;\nUNION\nSELECT * FROM t2\nLEFT JOIN t1 ON t2.id = t1.id\nWHERE t1.col1 = &apos;someValue&apos;\n\nSo the order of tables has changed, but the predicate is still applied to t1, but t1 is now in the &apos;ON&apos; clause. If t1.col1 is defined as NOT NULL\ncolumn, then this query will be null-rejected.\nAny outer-join (left, right, full) that is null-rejected is converted to an inner-join by MySQL.\nThus the results you might be expecting might be completely different from what the MySQL is returning. You might think its a bug with MySQL&apos;s RIGHT JOIN, but thats not right. Its just how the MySQL query optimizer works. So the developer in charge has to pay attention to these nuances when he/she is constructing the query.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"None of the previous answers are actually correct, because they do not follow the semantics when there are duplicated values.\nFor a query such as (from this duplicate):\nSELECT * FROM t1 FULL OUTER JOIN t2 ON t1.Name = t2.Name;\n\nThe correct equivalent is:\nSELECT t1.*, t2.*\nFROM (SELECT name FROM t1 UNION  -- This is intentionally UNION to remove duplicates\n      SELECT name FROM t2\n     ) n LEFT JOIN\n     t1\n     ON t1.name = n.name LEFT JOIN\n     t2\n     ON t2.name = n.name;\n\nIf you need this to work with NULL values (which may also be necessary), then use the NULL-safe comparison operator, &lt;=&gt; rather than =.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"In SQLite you should do this:\n\nSELECT * \nFROM leftTable lt \nLEFT JOIN rightTable rt ON lt.id = rt.lrid \nUNION\nSELECT lt.*, rl.*  -- To match column set\nFROM rightTable rt \nLEFT JOIN  leftTable lt ON lt.id = rt.lrid\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution6","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You can do the following:\n\n(SELECT \n    *\nFROM\n    table1 t1\n        LEFT JOIN\n    table2 t2 ON t1.id = t2.id\nWHERE\n    t2.id IS NULL)\nUNION ALL\n (SELECT \n    *\nFROM\n    table1 t1\n        RIGHT JOIN\n    table2 t2 ON t1.id = t2.id\nWHERE\n    t1.id IS NULL);\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution7","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I modified shA.t&apos;s query for more clarity:\n-- t1 left join t2\nSELECT t1.value, t2.value\nFROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.value = t2.value   \n\n    UNION ALL -- include duplicates\n\n-- t1 right exclude join t2 (records found only in t2)\nSELECT t1.value, t2.value\nFROM t1 RIGHT JOIN t2 ON t1.value = t2.value\nWHERE t1.value IS NULL \n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution8","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"SELECT\n    a.name,\n    b.title\nFROM\n    author AS a\nLEFT JOIN\n    book AS b\n    ON a.id = b.author_id\nUNION\nSELECT\n    a.name,\n    b.title\nFROM\n    author AS a\nRIGHT JOIN\n    book AS b\n    ON a.id = b.author_id\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution9","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You can just convert a full outer join, e.g.\nSELECT fields\nFROM firsttable\nFULL OUTER JOIN secondtable ON joincondition\n\ninto:\nSELECT fields\nFROM firsttable\nLEFT JOIN secondtable ON joincondition\nUNION ALL\nSELECT fields (replacing any fields from firsttable with NULL)\nFROM secondtable\nWHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM firsttable WHERE joincondition)\n\nOr if you have at least one column, say foo, in firsttable that is NOT NULL, you can do:\nSELECT fields\nFROM firsttable\nLEFT JOIN secondtable ON joincondition\nUNION ALL\nSELECT fields\nFROM firsttable\nRIGHT JOIN secondtable ON joincondition\nWHERE firsttable.foo IS NULL\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution10","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I fix the response, and works include all rows (based on the response of Pavle Lekic):\n    (\n    SELECT a.* FROM tablea a\n    LEFT JOIN tableb b ON a.`key` = b.key\n    WHERE b.`key` is null\n    )\n    UNION ALL\n    (\n    SELECT a.* FROM tablea a\n    LEFT JOIN tableb b ON a.`key` = b.key\n    where  a.`key` = b.`key`\n    )\n    UNION ALL\n    (\n    SELECT b.* FROM tablea a\n    right JOIN tableb b ON b.`key` = a.key\n    WHERE a.`key` is null\n    );\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution11","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Use:\nSELECT * FROM t1 FULL OUTER JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id;\n\nIt can be recreated as follows:\n SELECT t1.*, t2.*\n FROM (SELECT * FROM t1 UNION SELECT name FROM t2) tmp\n LEFT JOIN t1 ON t1.id = tmp.id\n LEFT JOIN t2 ON t2.id = tmp.id;\n\nUsing a UNION or UNION ALL answer does not cover the edge case where the base tables have duplicated entries.\nExplanation:\nThere is an edge case that a UNION or UNION ALL cannot cover.

<p>For a code <em>sample</em> transcribed from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2384298/mysql-full-outer-join-syntax-error">this Stack&nbsp;Overflow question</a> you have:</p>

<p>The query above works for special cases where a <em>full outer join</em> operation would not produce any duplicate rows. The query above depends on the <code>UNION</code> set operator to remove duplicate rows introduced by the query pattern.  We can avoid introducing duplicate rows by using an <em>anti-join</em> pattern for the second query, and then use a UNION ALL set operator to combine the two sets. In the more general case, where a full outer join would return duplicate rows, we can do this:</p>

<p>The answer that <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4796911/662581">Pablo Santa Cruz</a> gave is correct; however, in case anybody stumbled on this page and wants more clarification, here is a detailed breakdown.</p>

<h2>Example Tables</h2>

<p>Suppose we have the following tables:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-comment">-- t1</span>
id  name
<span class="hljs-number">1</span>   Tim
<span class="hljs-number">2</span>   Marta

<span class="hljs-comment">-- t2</span>
id  name
<span class="hljs-number">1</span>   Tim
<span class="hljs-number">3</span>   Katarina
</code></pre>

<h2>Inner Joins</h2>

<p>An inner join, like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> `t1`
<span class="hljs-keyword">INNER</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> `t2` <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> `t1`.`id` <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> `t2`.`id`;
</code></pre>

<p>Would get us only records that appear in both tables, like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-number">1</span> Tim  <span class="hljs-number">1</span> Tim
</code></pre>

<p>Inner joins don't have a direction (like left or right) because they are explicitly bidirectional - we require a match on both sides.</p>

<h2>Outer Joins</h2>

<p>Outer joins, on the other hand, are for finding records that may not have a match in the other table. As such, you have to specify <strong>which side</strong> of the join is allowed to have a missing record.</p>

<p><code>LEFT JOIN</code> and <code>RIGHT JOIN</code> are shorthand for <code>LEFT OUTER JOIN</code> and <code>RIGHT OUTER JOIN</code>; I will use their full names below to reinforce the concept of outer joins vs inner joins.</p>

<h3>Left Outer Join</h3>

<p>A left outer join, like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> `t1`
<span class="hljs-keyword">LEFT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">OUTER</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> `t2` <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> `t1`.`id` <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> `t2`.`id`;
</code></pre>

<p>...would get us all the records from the left table regardless of whether or not they have a match in the right table, like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-number">1</span> Tim   <span class="hljs-number">1</span>    Tim
<span class="hljs-number">2</span> Marta <span class="hljs-keyword">NULL</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">NULL</span>
</code></pre>

<h3>Right Outer Join</h3>

<p>A right outer join, like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> `t1`
<span class="hljs-keyword">RIGHT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">OUTER</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> `t2` <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> `t1`.`id` <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> `t2`.`id`;
</code></pre>

<p>...would get us all the records from the right table regardless of whether or not they have a match in the left table, like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-number">1</span>    Tim   <span class="hljs-number">1</span>  Tim
<span class="hljs-keyword">NULL</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">NULL</span>  <span class="hljs-number">3</span>  Katarina
</code></pre>

<h3>Full Outer Join</h3>

<p>A full outer join would give us all records from both tables, whether or not they have a match in the other table, with NULLs on both sides where there is no match. The result would look like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-number">1</span>    Tim   <span class="hljs-number">1</span>    Tim
<span class="hljs-number">2</span>    Marta <span class="hljs-keyword">NULL</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">NULL</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">NULL</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">NULL</span>  <span class="hljs-number">3</span>    Katarina
</code></pre>

<p>However, as Pablo Santa Cruz pointed out, MySQL doesn't support this. We can emulate it by doing a UNION of a left join and a right join, like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> `t1`
<span class="hljs-keyword">LEFT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">OUTER</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> `t2` <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> `t1`.`id` <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> `t2`.`id`

<span class="hljs-keyword">UNION</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> `t1`
<span class="hljs-keyword">RIGHT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">OUTER</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> `t2` <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> `t1`.`id` <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> `t2`.`id`;
</code></pre>

<p>You can think of a <code>UNION</code> as meaning "run both of these queries, then stack the results on top of each other"; some of the rows will come from the first query and some from the second.</p>

<p>It should be noted that a <code>UNION</code> in MySQL will eliminate exact duplicates: Tim would appear in both of the queries here, but the result of the <code>UNION</code> only lists him once. My database guru colleague feels that this behavior should not be relied upon. So to be more explicit about it, we could add a <code>WHERE</code> clause to the second query:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> `t1`
<span class="hljs-keyword">LEFT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">OUTER</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> `t2` <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> `t1`.`id` <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> `t2`.`id`

<span class="hljs-keyword">UNION</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> `t1`
<span class="hljs-keyword">RIGHT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">OUTER</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> `t2` <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> `t1`.`id` <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> `t2`.`id`
<span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> `t1`.`id` <span class="hljs-keyword">IS</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">NULL</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand, if you <strong>wanted</strong> to see duplicates for some reason, you could use <code>UNION ALL</code>.</p>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution3" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl border p-10 shadow-md w-9/12 bg-white"><h4 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 3</h4><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>Using a <em>union</em> query will remove duplicates, and this is different than the behavior of <em>full outer join</em> that never removes any duplicates:</p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">[<span class="hljs-keyword">Table</span>: t1]        [<span class="hljs-keyword">Table</span>: t2]

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This may be the best solution, both for efficiency and for generating the same results as a <code>FULL OUTER JOIN</code>. <a href="http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2006/05/26/how-to-write-full-outer-join-in-mysql" rel="nofollow noreferrer">This blog post</a> also explains it well - to quote from Method 2: <em>"This handles duplicate rows correctly and doesnt include anything it shouldnt. Its necessary to use <code>UNION ALL</code> instead of plain <code>UNION</code>, which would eliminate the duplicates I want to keep. This may be significantly more efficient on large result sets, since theres no need to sort and remove duplicates."</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I decided to add another solution that comes from <em>full outer join</em> visualization and math. It is not better than the above, but it is more readable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Full outer join means <code>(t1  t2)</code>: all in <code>t1</code> or in <code>t2</code>

<p>MySQL does not have FULL-OUTER-JOIN syntax. You have to emulate it by doing both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN as follows:</p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> t1
<span class="hljs-keyword">LEFT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> t2 <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> t1.id <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> t2.id
<span class="hljs-keyword">UNION</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> t1
<span class="hljs-keyword">RIGHT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> t2 <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> t1.id <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> t2.id
</code></pre>
<p>But MySQL also does not have a RIGHT JOIN syntax. According to MySQL's <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/outer-join-simplification.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">outer join simplification</a>, the right join is converted to the equivalent left join by switching the t1 and t2 in the <code>FROM</code> and <code>ON</code> clause in the query. Thus, the MySQL query optimizer translates the original query into the following -</p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> t1
<span class="hljs-keyword">LEFT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> t2 <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> t1.id <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> t2.id
<span class="hljs-keyword">UNION</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> t2
<span class="hljs-keyword">LEFT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> t1 <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> t2.id <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> t1.id
</code></pre>
<p>Now, there is no harm in writing the original query as is, but say if you have predicates like the WHERE clause, which is a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/techarticle/purcell/0112purcell.html#beforejoinpredicates" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong>before-join</strong></a> predicate or an AND predicate on the <code>ON</code> clause, which is a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/techarticle/purcell/0112purcell.html#duringjoinpredicates" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong>during-join</strong></a> predicate, then you might want to take a look at the devil; which is in details.</p>
<p>The MySQL query optimizer routinely checks the predicates if they are <em>null-rejected</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NioBX.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/NioBX.png" alt="Null-Rejected Definition and Examples"></a></p>
<p>Now, if you have done the RIGHT JOIN, but with WHERE predicate on the column from t1, then you might be at a risk of running into a <em>null-rejected</em> scenario.</p>
<p>For example, the query</p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> t1
<span class="hljs-keyword">LEFT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> t2 <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> t1.id <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> t2.id
<span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> t1.col1 <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'someValue'</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">UNION</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> t1
<span class="hljs-keyword">RIGHT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> t2 <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> t1.id <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> t2.id
<span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> t1.col1 <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'someValue'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>gets translated to the following by the query optimizer:</p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> t1
<span class="hljs-keyword">LEFT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> t2 <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> t1.id <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> t2.id
<span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> t1.col1 <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'someValue'</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">UNION</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> t2
<span class="hljs-keyword">LEFT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> t1 <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> t2.id <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> t1.id
<span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> t1.col1 <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'someValue'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>So the order of tables has changed, but the predicate is still applied to t1, but t1 is now in the 'ON' clause. If t1.col1 is defined as <code>NOT NULL</code>
column, then this query will be <em>null-rejected</em>.</p>
<p>Any outer-join (left, right, full) that is <em>null-rejected</em> is converted to an inner-join by MySQL.</p>
<p>Thus the results you might be expecting might be completely different from what the MySQL is returning. You might think its a bug with MySQL's RIGHT JOIN, but thats not right. Its just how the MySQL query optimizer works. So the developer in charge has to pay attention to these nuances when he/she is constructing the query.</p>

<p>The SQL standard says <code>full join on</code> is <code>inner join on</code> rows <code>union all</code> unmatched left table rows extended by nulls <code>union all</code> right table rows extended by nulls. Ie <code>inner join on</code> rows <code>union all</code> rows in <code>left join on</code> but not <code>inner join on</code> <code>union all</code> rows in <code>right join on</code> but not <code>inner join on</code>.</p>
<p>Ie <code>left join on</code> rows <code>union all</code> <code>right join on</code> rows not in <code>inner join on</code>. Or if you know your <code>inner join on</code> result can't have null in a particular right table column then "<code>right join on</code> rows not in <code>inner join on</code>" are rows in <code>right join on</code> with the <code>on</code> condition extended by <code>and</code> that column <code>is null</code>.</p>
<p>Ie similarly <code>right join on</code> <code>union all</code> appropriate <code>left join on</code> rows.</p>
