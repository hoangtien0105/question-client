Give Lodash a try. It has a number of must-have functions such as isEqual().\n\n_.isEqual(object, other);\n\n\nIt will brute force check each key value - just like the other examples on this page - using ECMAScript 5 and native optimizations if they&apos;re available in the browser.\n\nNote: Previously this answer recommended Underscore.js, but lodash has done a better job of getting bugs fixed and addressing issues with consistency.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"The short answer\nThe simple answer is: No, there is no generic means to determine that an object is equal to another in the sense you mean. The exception is when you are strictly thinking of an object being typeless.\nThe long answer\nThe concept is that of an Equals method that compares two different instances of an object to indicate whether they are equal at a value level. However, it is up to the specific type to define how an Equals method should be implemented. An iterative comparison of attributes that have primitive values may not be enough: an object may contain attributes which are not relevant to equality. For example,\n function MyClass(a, b)\n {\n     var c;\n     this.getCLazy = function() {\n         if (c === undefined) c = a * b // imagine * is really expensive\n         return c;\n     }\n  }\n\nIn this above case, c is not really important to determine whether any two instances of MyClass are equal, only a and b are important. In some cases c might vary between instances and yet not be significant during comparison.\nNote this issue applies when members may themselves also be instances of a type and these each would all be required to have a means of determining equality.\nFurther complicating things is that in JavaScript the distinction between data and method is blurred.\nAn object may reference a method that is to be called as an event handler, and this would likely not be considered part of its &apos;value state&apos;. Whereas another object may well be assigned a function that performs an important calculation and thereby makes this instance different from others simply because it references a different function.\nWhat about an object that has one of its existing prototype methods overridden by another function? Could it still be considered equal to another instance that it otherwise identical? That question can only be answered in each specific case for each type.\nAs stated earlier, the exception would be a strictly typeless object. In which case the only sensible choice is an iterative and recursive comparison of each member. Even then one has to ask what is the &apos;value&apos; of a function?\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"The default equality operator in JavaScript for Objects yields true when they refer to the same location in memory.\n\nvar x = {};\nvar y = {};\nvar z = x;\n\nx === y; // =&gt; false\nx === z; // =&gt; true\n\n\nIf you require a different equality operator you&apos;ll need to add an equals(other) method, or something like it to your classes and the specifics of your problem domain will determine what exactly that means.\n\nHere&apos;s a playing card example:\n\nfunction Card(rank, suit) {\n  this.rank = rank;\n  this.suit = suit;\n  this.equals = function(other) {\n     return other.rank == this.rank &amp;&amp; other.suit == this.suit;\n  };\n}\n\nvar queenOfClubs = new Card(12, &quot;C&quot;);\nvar kingOfSpades = new Card(13, &quot;S&quot;);\n\nqueenOfClubs.equals(kingOfSpades); // =&gt; false\nkingOfSpades.equals(new Card(13, &quot;S&quot;)); // =&gt; true\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"If you are working in AngularJS, the angular.equals function will determine if two objects are equal.

I am going to summarize and explain them (with a &quot;my father&quot; analogy) and add my suggested solution.\nYou have 4+1 classes of solutions:\n\n1) Use a hacky incomplete quick one-liner\nGood if you are in a rush and 99% correctness works.\nExamples of this is, JSON.stringify() suggested by Pratik Bhalodiya, or JSON.encode by Joel Anair, or .toString(), or other methods that transform your objects into a String and then compare the two Strings using === character by character.\nThe drawback, however, is that there is no globally standard unique representation of an Object in String.  e.g. { a: 5, b: 8} and {b: 8 and a: 5 } are equal.\n\nPros: Fast, quick.\nCons: Hopefully works!  It will not work if the environment/browser/engine memorizes the ordering for objects (e.g. Chrome/V8) and the order of the keys are different (Thanks to Eksapsy.) So, not guaranteed at all.  Performance wouldn&apos;t be great either in large objects.\n\nMy Father Analogy\nWhen I am talking about my father, &quot;my tall handsome father&quot; and &quot;my handsome tall father&quot; are the same person!  But the two strings are not the same.\nNote that there is actually a correct (standard way) order of adjectives in English grammar, which says it should be a &quot;handsome tall man,&quot; but you are risking your competency if you blindly assume Javascript engine of iOS 8 Safari is also abiding the same grammar, blindly! #WelcomeToJavascriptNonStandards\n\n2) Write your own DIY recursive function\nGood if you are learning.\nExamples are atmin&apos;s solution.\nThe biggest disadvantage is you will definitely miss some edge cases.  Have you considered a self-reference in object values?  Have you considered NaN? Have you considered two objects that have the same ownProperties but different prototypical parents?\nI would only encourage people to do this if they are practicing and the code is not going to go in production.  That&apos;s the only case that reinventing the wheel has justifications.\n\nPros: Learning opportunity.\nCons: Not reliable.  Takes time and concerns.\n\nMy Father Analogy\nIt&apos;s like assuming if my dad&apos;s name is &quot;John Smith&quot; and his birthday is &quot;1/1/1970&quot;, then anyone whose name is &quot;John Smith&quot; and is born on &quot;1/1/1970&quot; is my father.\nThat&apos;s usually the case, but what if there are two &quot;John Smith&quot;s born on that day?  If you think you will consider their height, then that&apos;s increasing the accuracy but still not a perfect comparison.\n2.1 You limited scope DIY comparator\nRather than going on a wild chase of checking all the properties recursively, one might consider checking only &quot;a limited&quot; number of properties.  For instance, if the objects are Users, you can compare their emailAddress field.\nIt&apos;s still not a perfect one, but the benefits over solution #2 are:\n\nIt&apos;s predictable, and it&apos;s less likely to crash.\nYou are driving the &quot;definition&quot; of equality, rather than relying on a wild form and shape of the Object and its prototype and nested properties.\n\n\n3) Use a library version of equal function\nGood if you need a production-level quality, and you cannot change the design of the system.\nExamples are _.equal of lodash, already in coolaj86&apos;s answer or Angular&apos;s or Ember&apos;s as mentioned in Tony Harvey&apos;s answer or Node&apos;s by Rafael Xavier.\n\nPros: It&apos;s what everyone else does.\nCons: External dependency, which can cost you extra memory/CPU/Security concerns, even a little bit.  Also, can still miss some edge cases (e.g. whether two objects having same ownProperties but different prototypical parents should be considered the same or not.) Finally, you might be unintentionally band-aiding an underlying design problem with this; just saying!\n\nMy Father Analogy\nIt&apos;s like paying an agency to find my biological father, based on his phone, name, address, etc.\nIt&apos;s gonna cost more, and it&apos;s probably more accurate than myself running the background check, but doesn&apos;t cover edge cases like when my father is immigrant/asylum and his birthday is unknown!\n\n4) Use an IDentifier in the Object\nGood if you [still] can change the design of the system (objects you are dealing with) and you want your code to last long.\nIt&apos;s not applicable in all cases, and might not be very performant.  However, it&apos;s a very reliable solution, if you can make it.\nThe solution is, every object in the system will have a unique identifier along with all the other properties.  The uniqueness of the identifier will be guaranteed at the time of generation.  And you will use this ID (also known as UUID/GUID -- Globally/Universally Unique Identifier) when it comes to comparing two objects.  i.e. They are equal if and only if these IDs are equal.\nThe IDs can be simple auto_incremental numbers, or a string generated via a library (advised) or a piece of code.  All you need to do is make sure it&apos;s always unique, which in case of auto_incremental it can be built-in, or in case of UUID, can be checked will all existing values (e.g. MySQL&apos;s UNIQUE column attribute) or simply (if coming from a library) be relied upon giving the extremely low likelihood of a collision.\nNote that you also need to store the ID with the object at all times (to guarantee its uniqueness), and computing it in real-time might not be the best approach.\n\nPros: Reliable, efficient, not dirty, modern.\nCons: Needs extra space.  Might need a redesign of the system.\n\nMy Father Analogy\nIt&apos;s like known my father&apos;s Social Security Number is 911-345-9283, so anyone who has this SSN is my father, and anyone who claims to be my father must have this SSN.\n\nConclusion\nI personally prefer solution #4 (ID) over them all for accuracy and reliability.

<p>Stack Overflow question <em><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/194846">Is there any kind of hashCode function in JavaScript?</a></em> is similar to this question, but requires a more academic answer.

<p><strong>The short answer</strong></p>
<p>The simple answer is: No, there is no generic means to determine that an object is equal to another in the sense you mean. The exception is when you are strictly thinking of an object being typeless.</p>
<p><strong>The long answer</strong></p>
<p>The concept is that of an Equals method that compares two different instances of an object to indicate whether they are equal at a value level. However, it is up to the specific type to define how an <code>Equals</code> method should be implemented. An iterative comparison of attributes that have primitive values may not be enough: an object may contain attributes which are not relevant to equality. For example,</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"> <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">MyClass</span>(<span class="hljs-params">a, b</span>)
 {
     <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> c;
     <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">getCLazy</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
         <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (c === <span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span>) c = a * b <span class="hljs-comment">// imagine * is really expensive</span>
         <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> c;
     }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>In this above case, <code>c</code> is not really important to determine whether any two instances of MyClass are equal, only <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are important. In some cases <code>c</code> might vary between instances and yet not be significant during comparison.</p>
<p>Note this issue applies when members may themselves also be instances of a type and these each would all be required to have a means of determining equality.</p>
<p>Further complicating things is that in JavaScript the distinction between data and method is blurred.</p>
<p>An object may reference a method that is to be called as an event handler, and this would likely not be considered part of its 'value state'. Whereas another object may well be assigned a function that performs an important calculation and thereby makes this instance different from others simply because it references a different function.</p>
<p>What about an object that has one of its existing prototype methods overridden by another function? Could it still be considered equal to another instance that it otherwise identical? That question can only be answered in each specific case for each type.</p>
<p>As stated earlier, the exception would be a strictly typeless object. In which case the only sensible choice is an iterative and recursive comparison of each member. Even then one has to ask what is the 'value' of a function?</p>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution3" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl border p-10 shadow-md w-9/12 bg-white"><h4 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 3</h4><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>The default equality operator in JavaScript for Objects yields true when they refer to the same location in memory.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> x = {};
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> y = {};
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> z = x;

x === y; <span class="hljs-comment">// =&gt; false</span>
x === z; <span class="hljs-comment">// =&gt; true</span>
</code></pre>

<p>If you require a different equality operator you'll need to add an <code>equals(other)</code> method, or something like it to your classes and the specifics of your problem domain will determine what exactly that means.</p>

<p>Here's a playing card example:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">Card</span>(<span class="hljs-params">rank, suit</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">rank</span> = rank;
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">suit</span> = suit;
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">equals</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">other</span>) {
     <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> other.<span class="hljs-property">rank</span> == <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">rank</span> &amp;&amp; other.<span class="hljs-property">suit</span> == <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">suit</span>;
  };
}

<a href="http://nodejs.org/api/assert.html" rel="noreferrer">http://nodejs.org/api/assert.html</a></p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Are you trying to test if two objects are the equal? ie: their properties are equal?</p>

<p>If this is the case, you'll probably have noticed this situation:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = { foo : <span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span> };
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> b = { foo : <span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span> };
alert (a == b ? <span class="hljs-string">"Equal"</span> : <span class="hljs-string">"Not equal"</span>);
<span class="hljs-comment">// "Not equal"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>you might have to do something like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">objectEquals</span>(<span class="hljs-params">obj1, obj2</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> obj1) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (obj1.<span class="hljs-title function_">hasOwnProperty</span>(i)) {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!obj2.<span class="hljs-title function_">hasOwnProperty</span>(i)) <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
            <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (obj1[i] != obj2[i]) <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
        }
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> obj2) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (obj2.<span class="hljs-title function_">hasOwnProperty</span>(i)) {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!obj1.<span class="hljs-title function_">hasOwnProperty</span>(i)) <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
            <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (obj1[i] != obj2[i]) <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
        }
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously that function could do with quite a bit of optimisation, and the ability to do deep checking (to handle nested objects: <code>var a = { foo : { fu : "bar" } }</code>) but you get the idea.</p>

<p>As FOR pointed out, you might have to adapt this for your own purposes, eg: different classes may have different definitions of "equal". If you're just working with plain objects, the above may suffice, otherwise a custom <code>MyClass.equals()</code> function may be the way to go.</p>

<p>If you have a deep copy function handy, you can use the following trick to <em>still</em> use <code>JSON.stringify</code> while matching the order of properties:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">equals</span>(<span class="hljs-params">obj1, obj2</span>) {

    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">_equals</span>(obj1, obj2) &amp;&amp; <span class="hljs-title function_">_equals</span>(obj2, obj1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Demo: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/CU3vb/3/" rel="noreferrer">http://jsfiddle.net/CU3vb/3/</a></p>

<p>Rationale:</p>

<p>Since the properties of <code>obj1</code> are copied to the clone one by one, their order in the clone will be preserved. And when the properties of <code>obj2</code> are copied to the clone, since properties already existing in <code>obj1</code> will simply be overwritten, their orders in the clone will be preserved.</p>

<p>This question has more than 30 answers already.  I am going to summarize and explain them (with a "my father" analogy) and add my suggested solution.</p>
<p>You have <strong>4+1 classes of solutions</strong>:</p>
<hr>
<h1>1) Use a hacky incomplete quick one-liner</h1>
<p><strong>Good if you are in a rush and 99% correctness works.</strong></p>
<p>Examples of this is, <code>JSON.stringify()</code> suggested <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/46645497/2321594">by Pratik Bhalodiya</a>, or <code>JSON.encode</code> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/201305/2321594">by Joel Anair</a>, or <code>.toString()</code>, or other methods that transform your objects into a String and then compare the two Strings using <code>===</code> character by character.</p>
<p>The drawback, however, is that there is no globally standard unique representation of an Object in String.  e.g. <code>{ a: 5, b: 8}</code> and <code>{b: 8 and a: 5 }</code> are equal.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Fast, quick.</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> <em>Hopefully</em> works!  <strong>It will not work if the environment/browser/engine memorizes the ordering for objects (e.g. Chrome/V8) and the order of the keys are different</strong> (Thanks to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1712332/eksapsy">Eksapsy</a>.) So, not guaranteed at all.  Performance wouldn't be great either in large objects.</li>
</ul>
<h3>My Father Analogy</h3>
<p>When I am talking about my father, "<strong>my tall handsome father</strong>" and "<strong>my handsome tall father</strong>" are the same person!  But the two strings are not the same.</p>
<p>Note that there is actually a <strong>correct (standard way) order</strong> of adjectives in English grammar, which <a href="https://preply.com/en/blog/2014/02/18/the-correct-order-of-adjectives-in-english-rules-and-examples/#scroll-to-heading-1" rel="noreferrer">says</a> it should be a "handsome tall man," but you are risking your competency if you blindly assume Javascript engine of iOS 8 Safari is also abiding the same grammar, blindly! #WelcomeToJavascriptNonStandards</p>
<hr>
<h1>2) Write your own DIY recursive function</h1>
<p><strong>Good if you are learning.</strong></p>
<p>Examples are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/32922084/2321594">atmin's solution</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest disadvantage is you will definitely miss some edge cases.  Have you considered a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/2787309/2321594">self-reference</a> in object values?  Have you considered <code>NaN</code>? Have you considered two objects that have the same <code>ownProperties</code> but different prototypical parents?</p>
<p>I would only encourage people to do this if they are practicing and the code is not going to go in production.  That's the only case that <em>reinventing the wheel</em> has justifications.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Learning opportunity.</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Not reliable.  Takes time and concerns.</li>
</ul>
<h3>My Father Analogy</h3>
<p>It's like assuming if my dad's name is "John Smith" and his birthday is "1/1/1970", then anyone whose name is "John Smith" and is born on "1/1/1970" is my father.</p>
<p>That's usually the case, but what if there are two "John Smith"s born on that day?  If you think you will consider their height, then that's increasing the accuracy but still not a perfect comparison.</p>
<h2>2.1 You limited scope DIY comparator</h2>
<p>Rather than going on a wild chase of checking all the properties recursively, one might consider checking only "a limited" number of properties.  For instance, if the objects are <code>User</code>s, you can compare their <code>emailAddress</code> field.</p>
<p>It's still not a perfect one, but the benefits over solution #2 are:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's predictable, and it's less likely to crash.</li>
<li>You are driving the "definition" of equality, rather than relying on a wild form and shape of the Object and its prototype and nested properties.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h1>3) Use a library version of <code>equal</code> function</h1>
<p><strong>Good if you need a production-level quality, and you cannot change the design of the system.</strong></p>
<p>Examples are <code>_.equal</code> <a href="https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#isEqual" rel="noreferrer">of lodash</a>, already in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3198202/2321594">coolaj86's answer</a> or Angular's or Ember's as mentioned in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/19055489/2321594">Tony Harvey's answer</a> or Node's <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/26016880/2321594">by Rafael Xavier</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> It's what everyone else does.</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> External dependency, which can cost you extra memory/CPU/Security concerns, even a little bit.  Also, can still miss some edge cases (e.g. whether two objects having same <code>ownProperties</code> but different prototypical parents should be considered the same or not.) Finally, <strong>you <em>might</em> be unintentionally band-aiding an underlying design problem with this; just saying!</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>My Father Analogy</h3>
<p>It's like paying an agency to find my biological father, based on his phone, name, address, etc.</p>
<p>It's gonna cost more, and it's probably more accurate than myself running the background check, but doesn't cover edge cases like when my father is immigrant/asylum and his birthday is unknown!</p>
<hr>
<h1>4) Use an IDentifier in the Object</h1>
<p><strong>Good if you [still] can change the design of the system (objects you are dealing with) and you want your code to last long.</strong></p>
<p>It's not applicable in all cases, and might not be very performant.  However, it's a very reliable solution, if you can make it.</p>
<p>The solution is, every <code>object</code> in the system will have a <strong>unique</strong> identifier along with all the other properties.  The <em>uniqueness</em> of the identifier will be guaranteed at the time of generation.  And you will use this ID (also known as UUID/GUID -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier" rel="noreferrer">Globally/Universally Unique Identifier</a>) when it comes to comparing two objects.  i.e. They are equal if and only if these IDs are equal.</p>
<p>The IDs can be simple <code>auto_incremental</code> numbers, or a string generated via <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid" rel="noreferrer">a library</a> (advised) or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/105034/how-to-create-guid-uuid">a piece of code</a>.  All you need to do is make sure it's always unique, which in case of <code>auto_incremental</code> it can be built-in, or in case of UUID, can be checked will all existing values (e.g. MySQL's <code>UNIQUE</code> column attribute) or simply (if coming from a library) be relied upon giving the extremely low likelihood of a collision.</p>
<p>Note that you also need to store the ID with the object at all times (to guarantee its uniqueness), and computing it in real-time might not be the best approach.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Reliable, efficient, not dirty, modern.</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Needs extra space.  Might need a redesign of the system.</li>
</ul>
<h3>My Father Analogy</h3>
<p>It's like known my father's Social Security Number is 911-345-9283, so anyone who has this SSN is my father, and anyone who claims to be my father must have this SSN.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I personally prefer solution #4 (ID) over them all for accuracy and reliability.  If it's not possible I'd go with #2.1 for predictability, and then #3.  If neither is possible, #2 and finally #1.</p>

<p>Below is a short implementation which uses <code>JSON.stringify</code> but sorts the keys as @Jor suggested <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/53593328/2604492">here</a>.</p>
<p>Some tests were taken from the answer of @EbrahimByagowi <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/16788517/2604492">here</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, by using <code>JSON.stringify</code>, the solution is limited to JSON-serializable types (a string, a number, a JSON object, an array, a boolean, null). Objects like <code>Date</code>, <code>Function</code>, etc. are not supported.</p>

<p>EDIT: This method is quite flawed, and is rife with its own issues. I don't recommend it, and would appreciate some down-votes! It is problematic because 1) Some things can not be compared (i.e. functions) because they can not be serialized, 2) It isn't a very fast method of comparing, 3) It has ordering issues, 4) It can have collision issues/false positives if not properly implemented, 5) It can't check for "exactness" (<code>===</code>), and instead is based of value equality, which is oftentimes not what is desired in a comparison method.</p>
<p>A simple solution to this issue that many people don't realize is to sort the JSON strings (per character). This is also usually faster than the other solutions mentioned here:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">areEqual</span>(<span class="hljs-params">obj1, obj2</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = <span class="hljs-title class_">JSON</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">stringify</span>(obj1), b = <span class="hljs-title class_">JSON</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">stringify</span>(obj2);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!a) a = <span class="hljs-string">''</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!b) b = <span class="hljs-string">''</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> (a.<span class="hljs-title function_">split</span>(<span class="hljs-string">''</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">sort</span>().<span class="hljs-title function_">join</span>(<span class="hljs-string">''</span>) == b.<span class="hljs-title function_">split</span>(<span class="hljs-string">''</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">sort</span>().<span class="hljs-title function_">join</span>(<span class="hljs-string">''</span>));
}
</code></pre>
<p>Another useful thing about this method is you can filter comparisons by passing a "replacer" function to the JSON.stringify functions (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#Example_of_using_replacer_parameter" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#Example_of_using_replacer_parameter</a>).

<p>This Algorithm is split into two parts; The equals function itself and a function to find the numeric index of a property in an array / object. The find function is only needed because indexof only finds numbers and strings and no objects .</p>

<p>One can call it like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">({<span class="hljs-attr">a</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">b</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"h"</span>}).<span class="hljs-title function_">equals</span>({<span class="hljs-attr">a</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">b</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"h"</span>});
</code></pre>

<p>The function either returns true or false, in this case true.
The algorithm als allows comparison between very complex objects:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">({<span class="hljs-attr">a</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">b</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"hello"</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">c</span>: [<span class="hljs-string">"w"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"o"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"r"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"l"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"d"</span>, {<span class="hljs-attr">answer1</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"should be"</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">answer2</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>}]}).<span class="hljs-title function_">equals</span>({<span class="hljs-attr">b</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"hello"</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">a</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">c</span>: [<span class="hljs-string">"w"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"d"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"o"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"r"</span>, {<span class="hljs-attr">answer1</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"should be"</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">answer2</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>}, <span class="hljs-string">"l"</span>]})
</code></pre>

<p>The upper example will return true, even tho the properties have a different ordering. One small detail to look out for: This code also checks for the same type of two variables, so "3" is not the same as 3.</p>

<p>I'd advise against hashing or serialization (as the JSON solution suggest).  If you need to test if two objects are equal, then you need to define what equals means.  It could be that all data members in both objects match, or it could be that must the memory locations match (meaning both variables reference the same object in memory), or may be that only one data member in each object must match.</p>

<p>Recently I developed an object whose constructor creates a new id (starting from 1 and incrementing by 1) each time an instance is created.  This object has an isEqual function that compares that id value with the id value of another object and returns true if they match.</p>

<p>In that case I defined "equal" as meaning the the id values match.  Given that each instance has a unique id this could be used to enforce the idea that matching objects also occupy the same memory location.  Although that is not necessary.</p>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution29" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl border p-10 shadow-md w-9/12 bg-white"><h4 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 29</h4><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>It's useful to consider two objects equal if they have all the same values for all properties and recursively for all nested objects and arrays.  I also consider the following two objects equal:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = {<span class="hljs-attr">p1</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>};
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> b = {<span class="hljs-attr">p1</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">p2</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span>};
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, arrays can have "missing" elements and undefined elements.  I would treat those the same as well:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> c = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>];
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> d = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span>];
</code></pre>

However, it is up to the specific type to define how an \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Equals\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; method should be implemented. An iterative comparison of attributes that have primitive values may not be enough: an object may contain attributes which are not relevant to equality.

I don\u0026apos;t recommend it, and would appreciate some down-votes! It is problematic because 1) Some things can not be compared (i.e. functions) because they can not be serialized, 2) It isn\u0026apos;t a very fast method of comparing, 3) It has ordering issues, 4) It can have collision issues/false positives if not properly implemented, 5) It can\u0026apos;t check for \u0026quot;exactness\u0026quot; (\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;===\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;), and instead is based of value equality, which is oftentimes not what is desired in a comparison method.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A simple solution to this issue that many people don\u0026apos;t realize is to sort the JSON strings (per character).
