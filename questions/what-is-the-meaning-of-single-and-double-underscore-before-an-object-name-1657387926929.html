However, privacy is not enforced in any way.\nFrom the PEP-8 style guide:\n\n_single_leading_underscore: weak &quot;internal use&quot; indicator. E.g. from M import * does not import objects whose name starts with an underscore.\n\nDouble Underscore (Name Mangling)\nFrom the Python docs:\n\nAny identifier of the form __spam (at least two leading underscores, at most one trailing underscore) is textually replaced with _classname__spam, where classname is the current class name with leading underscore(s) stripped. This mangling is done without regard to the syntactic position of the identifier, so it can be used to define class-private instance and class variables, methods, variables stored in globals, and even variables stored in instances. private to this class on instances of other classes.\n\nAnd a warning from the same page:\n\nName mangling is intended to give classes an easy way to define private instance variables and methods, without having to worry about instance variables defined by derived classes, or mucking with instance variables by code outside the class. Note that the mangling rules are designed mostly to avoid accidents; it still is possible for a determined soul to access or modify a variable that is considered private.\n\nExample\n&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyClass():\n...     def __init__(self):\n...             self.__superprivate = &quot;Hello&quot;\n...             self._semiprivate = &quot;, world!&quot;\n...\n&gt;&gt;&gt; mc = MyClass()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print mc.__superprivate\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nAttributeError: myClass instance has no attribute &apos;__superprivate&apos;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print mc._semiprivate\n, world!\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print mc.__dict__\n{&apos;_MyClass__superprivate&apos;: &apos;Hello&apos;, &apos;_semiprivate&apos;: &apos;, world!&apos;}\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"\n_foo: Only a convention.

A way for the Python system to use names that won&apos;t conflict with user names.\n\n\nNo other form of underscores have meaning in the Python world. Also, there&apos;s no difference between class, variable, global, etc in these conventions.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Excellent answers so far but some tidbits are missing. A single leading underscore isn&apos;t exactly just a convention: if you use from foobar import *, and module foobar does not define an __all__ list, the names imported from the module do not include those with a leading underscore. Let&apos;s say it&apos;s mostly a convention, since this case is a pretty obscure corner;-).\n\nThe leading-underscore convention is widely used not just for private names, but also for what C++ would call protected ones -- for example, names of methods that are fully intended to be overridden by subclasses (even ones that have to be overridden since in the base class they raise NotImplementedError!-) are often single-leading-underscore names to indicate to code using instances of that class (or subclasses) that said methods are not meant to be called directly.\n\nFor example, to make a thread-safe queue with a different queueing discipline than FIFO, one imports Queue, subclasses Queue.Queue, and overrides such methods as _get and _put; &quot;client code&quot; never calls those (&quot;hook&quot;) methods, but rather the (&quot;organizing&quot;) public methods such as put and get (this is known as the Template Method design pattern -- see e.g. here for an interesting presentation based on a video of a talk of mine on the subject, with the addition of synopses of the transcript).\n\nEdit: The video links in the description of the talks are now broken.

The double underscores just namemangles, or renames, the variable to something like instance._className__mangled\n\nExample:\n\nclass Test(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.__a = &apos;a&apos;\n        self._b = &apos;b&apos;\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; t = Test()\n&gt;&gt;&gt; t._b\n&apos;b&apos;\n\n\nt._b is accessible because it is only hidden by convention\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; t.__a\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\nAttributeError: &apos;Test&apos; object has no attribute &apos;__a&apos;\n\n\nt.__a isn&apos;t found because it no longer exists due to namemangling\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; t._Test__a\n&apos;a&apos;\n\n\nBy accessing instance._className__variable instead of just the double underscore name, you can access the hidden value\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Single underscore at the beginning:\n\nPython doesn&apos;t have real private methods.

In this code, errors is a public property, but the method this property calls, _get_errors, is &quot;private&quot;, so you shouldn&apos;t access it.\n\nTwo underscores at the beginning:\n\nThis causes a lot of confusion. It should not be used to create a private method. It should be used to avoid your method being overridden by a subclass or accessed accidentally. Let&apos;s see an example:\n\nclass A(object):\n    def __test(self):\n        print &quot;I&apos;m a test method in class A&quot;\n\n    def test(self):\n        self.__test()\n\na = A()\na.test()\n# a.__test() # This fails with an AttributeError\na._A__test() # Works! We can access the mangled name directly!\n\n\nOutput: \n\n$ python test.py\nI&apos;m test method in class A\nI&apos;m test method in class A\n\n\nNow create a subclass B and do customization for __test method\n\nclass B(A):\n    def __test(self):\n        print &quot;I&apos;m test method in class B&quot;\n\nb = B()\nb.test()\n\n\nOutput will be....\n\n$ python test.py\nI&apos;m test method in class A\n\n\nAs we have seen, A.test() didn&apos;t call B.__test() methods, as we might expect. But in fact, this is the correct behavior for __. The two methods called __test() are automatically renamed (mangled) to _A__test() and _B__test(), so they do not accidentally override.  When you create a method starting with __ it means that you don&apos;t want to anyone to be able to override it, and you only intend to access it from inside its own class.\n\nTwo underscores at the beginning and at the end:\n\nWhen we see a method like __this__, don&apos;t call it. This is a method which python is meant to call, not you. Let&apos;s take a look:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name = &quot;test string&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; name.__len__()\n11\n&gt;&gt;&gt; len(name)\n11\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; number = 10\n&gt;&gt;&gt; number.__add__(40)\n50\n&gt;&gt;&gt; number + 50\n60\n\n\nThere is always an operator or native function which calls these magic methods. Sometimes it&apos;s just a hook python calls in specific situations. For example __init__() is called when the object is created after __new__() is called to build the instance...\n\nLet&apos;s take an example...\n\nclass FalseCalculator(object):\n\n    def __init__(self, number):\n        self.number = number\n\n    def __add__(self, number):\n        return self.number - number\n\n    def __sub__(self, number):\n        return self.number + number\n\nnumber = FalseCalculator(20)\nprint number + 10      # 10\nprint number - 20      # 40\n\n\nFor more details, see the PEP-8 guide.

It makes your subclasses free to override any one method without breaking the others.\n\n\nSay you don&apos;t keep a local reference of perimeter in Circle. Now, a derived class Tire overrides the implementation of perimeter, without touching area. When you call Tire(5).area(), in theory it should still be using Circle.perimeter for computation, but in reality it&apos;s using Tire.perimeter, which is not the intended behavior. That&apos;s why we need a local reference in Circle.\n\nBut why __perimeter instead of _perimeter? Because _perimeter still gives derived class the chance to override:\n\nclass Tire(Circle):\n\n    def perimeter(self):\n        return Circle.perimeter(self) * 1.25\n\n    _perimeter = perimeter\n\n\nDouble underscores has name mangling, so there&apos;s a very little chance that the local reference in parent class get override in derived class. thus &quot;makes your subclasses free to override any one method without breaking the others&quot;.\n\nIf your class won&apos;t be inherited, or method overriding does not break anything, then you simply don&apos;t need __double_leading_underscore.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution8","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"\n_var: variables with a leading single underscore in python are classic variables, intended to inform others using your code that this variable should be reserved for internal use.

<h2>Single Underscore</h2>
<p>In a class, names with a leading underscore indicate to other programmers that the attribute or method is intended to be private.  However, privacy is not <em>enforced</em> in any way.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/" rel="noreferrer">PEP-8</a> style guide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>_single_leading_underscore</code>: weak "internal use" indicator. E.g. <code>from M import *</code> does not import objects whose name starts with an underscore.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Double Underscore (Name Mangling)</h2>
<p>From <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables" rel="noreferrer">the Python docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any identifier of the form <code>__spam</code> (at least two leading underscores, at most one trailing underscore) is textually replaced with <code>_classname__spam</code>, where <code>classname</code> is the current class name with leading underscore(s) stripped. This mangling is done without regard to the syntactic position of the identifier, so it can be used to define class-private instance and class variables, methods, variables stored in globals, and even variables stored in instances. private to this class on instances of other classes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And a warning from the same page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Name mangling is intended to give classes an easy way to define private instance variables and methods, without having to worry about instance variables defined by derived classes, or mucking with instance variables by code outside the class. Note that the mangling rules are designed mostly to avoid accidents; <em>it still is possible for a determined soul to access or modify a variable that is considered private.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Excellent answers so far but some tidbits are missing. A single leading underscore isn't exactly <em>just</em> a convention: if you use <code>from foobar import *</code>, and module <code>foobar</code> does not define an <code>__all__</code> list, the names imported from the module <strong>do not</strong> include those with a leading underscore. Let's say it's <em>mostly</em> a convention, since this case is a pretty obscure corner;-).</p>

<p>The leading-underscore convention is widely used not just for <em>private</em> names, but also for what C++ would call <em>protected</em> ones -- for example, names of methods that are fully intended to be overridden by subclasses (even ones that <strong>have</strong> to be overridden since in the base class they <code>raise NotImplementedError</code>!-) are often single-leading-underscore names to indicate to code <strong>using</strong> instances of that class (or subclasses) that said methods are not meant to be called directly.</p>

<p>For example, to make a thread-safe queue with a different queueing discipline than FIFO, one imports Queue, subclasses Queue.Queue, and overrides such methods as <code>_get</code> and <code>_put</code>; "client code" never calls those ("hook") methods, but rather the ("organizing") public methods such as <code>put</code> and <code>get</code> (this is known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern" rel="noreferrer">Template Method</a> design pattern -- see e.g. <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/learning-python-design-patterns-through-video-lectures/" rel="noreferrer">here</a> for an interesting presentation based on a video of a talk of mine on the subject, with the addition of synopses of the transcript).</p>

<p>Edit: The video links in the description of the talks are now broken. You can find the first two videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Sbzmz1Nxvo" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJXhtncDBu4" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p><code>._variable</code> is semiprivate and meant just for convention</p>

<p><code>.__variable</code> is often incorrectly considered superprivate, while it's actual meaning is just to namemangle to <strong>prevent accidental access</strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTLu2DFOdTg&amp;t=33m8s" rel="noreferrer">[1]</a></p>

<p><code>.__variable__</code> is typically reserved for builtin methods or variables</p>

<p>You can still access <code>.__mangled</code> variables if you desperately want to. The double underscores just namemangles, or renames, the variable to something like <code>instance._className__mangled</code></p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Test</span>(<span class="hljs-title class_ inherited__">object</span>):

<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>t = Test()
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>t._b
<span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>

<p>t._b is accessible because it is only hidden by convention</p>

<p><strong>Single underscore at the beginning:</strong></p>

<p>Python doesn't have real private methods. Instead, one underscore at the start of a method or attribute name means you shouldn't access this method, because it's not part of the API.</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">BaseForm</span>(<span class="hljs-title class_ inherited__">StrAndUnicode</span>):

        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> self._errors

    errors = <span class="hljs-built_in">property</span>(_get_errors)
</code></pre>

<p>(This code snippet was taken from django source code: django/forms/forms.py). In this code, <code>errors</code> is a public property, but the method this property calls, _get_errors, is "private", so you shouldn't access it.</p>

<p><strong>Two underscores at the beginning:</strong></p>

<p>This causes a lot of confusion. It should not be used to create a private method. It should be used to avoid your method being overridden by a subclass or accessed accidentally. Let's see an example:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">A</span>(<span class="hljs-title class_ inherited__">object</span>):
    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">__test</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self</span>):
        <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> <span class="hljs-string">"I'm a test method in class A"</span>

    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">test</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self</span>):
        self.__test()

a = A()
a.test()
<span class="hljs-comment"># a.__test() # This fails with an AttributeError</span>
a._A__test() <span class="hljs-comment"># Works! We can access the mangled name directly!</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Output: </p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">$ python test.py
I<span class="hljs-string">'m test method in class A
I'</span>m test method <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">A</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Now create a subclass B and do customization for __test method</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">B</span>(<span class="hljs-title class_ inherited__">A</span>):
    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">__test</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self</span>):
        <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> <span class="hljs-string">"I'm test method in class B"</span>

b = B()
b.test()
</code></pre>

<p>Output will be....</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">$ python test.py
I<span class="hljs-string">'m test method in class A
</span></code></pre>

<p>As we have seen, A.test() didn't call B.__test() methods, as we might expect. But in fact, this is the correct behavior for __. The two methods called __test() are automatically renamed (mangled) to _A__test() and _B__test(), so they do not accidentally override.  When you create a method starting with __ it means that you don't want to anyone to be able to override it, and you only intend to access it from inside its own class.</p>

<p><strong>Two underscores at the beginning and at the end:</strong></p>

<p>When we see a method like <code>__this__</code>, don't call it. This is a method which python is meant to call, not you. Let's take a look:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>name = <span class="hljs-string">"test string"</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>name.__len__()
<span class="hljs-number">11</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-built_in">len</span>(name)
<span class="hljs-number">11</span>

<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>number = <span class="hljs-number">10</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>number.__add__(<span class="hljs-number">40</span>)
<span class="hljs-number">50</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>number + <span class="hljs-number">50</span>
<span class="hljs-number">60</span>
</code></pre>

<p>There is always an operator or native function which calls these magic methods. Sometimes it's just a hook python calls in specific situations. For example <code>__init__()</code> is called when the object is created after <code>__new__()</code> is called to build the instance...</p>

<p>Let's take an example...</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">FalseCalculator</span>(<span class="hljs-title class_ inherited__">object</span>):

    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">__init__</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self, number</span>):
        self.number = number

    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">__add__</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self, number</span>):
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> self.number - number

    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">__sub__</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self, number</span>):
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> self.number + number

  <p>The intention of the double underscores was not about privacy. The intention was to use it exactly like this</p>

  <p><strong>It's actually the opposite of privacy, it's all about freedom. It makes your subclasses free to override any one method without breaking the others</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Say you don't keep a local reference of <code>perimeter</code> in <code>Circle</code>. Now, a derived class <code>Tire</code> overrides the implementation of <code>perimeter</code>, without touching <code>area</code>. When you call <code>Tire(5).area()</code>, in theory it should still be using <code>Circle.perimeter</code> for computation, but in reality it's using <code>Tire.perimeter</code>, which is not the intended behavior. That's why we need a local reference in Circle.</p>

<p>But why <code>__perimeter</code> instead of <code>_perimeter</code>? Because <code>_perimeter</code> still gives derived class the chance to override:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Tire</span>(<span class="hljs-title class_ inherited__">Circle</span>):

    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">perimeter</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self</span>):
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> Circle.perimeter(self) * <span class="hljs-number">1.25</span>

    _perimeter = perimeter
</code></pre>

<p>Double underscores has name mangling, so there's a very little chance that the local reference in parent class get override in derived class. thus "<strong>makes your subclasses free to override any one method without breaking the others</strong>".</p>

<p>If your class won't be inherited, or method overriding does not break anything, then you simply don't need <code>__double_leading_underscore</code>.</p>

<p>Here is a simple illustrative example on how double underscore properties can affect an inherited class. So with the following setup:</p>

<p>if you then create a child instance in the python REPL, you will see the below</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">child_a = child()

<p>Single leading underscores is a convention. there is no difference from the interpreter's point of view if whether names starts with a single underscore or not. </p>

<p>Double leading and trailing underscores are used for built-in methods, such as <code>__init__</code>, <code>__bool__</code>, etc.</p>

<p>Double leading underscores w/o trailing counterparts are a convention too, however, the class methods will be <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#private-variables" rel="noreferrer">mangled</a> by the interpreter. For variables or basic function names no difference exists.</p>

<p>Your question is good, it is not only about methods. Functions and objects in modules are commonly prefixed with one underscore as well, and can be prefixed by two.</p>

<p>But __double_underscore names are not name-mangled in modules, for example. What happens is that names beginning with one (or more) underscores are not imported if you import all from a module (from module import *), nor are the names shown in help(module).</p>

<p>Private instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an object dont exist in Python. However, there is a convention that is followed by most Python code: a name prefixed with an underscore (e.g. _spam) should be treated as a non-public part of the API (whether it is a function, a method or a data member). It should be considered an implementation detail and subject to change without notice.</p>

<p>Getting the facts of _ and __ is pretty easy; the other answers express them pretty well. The usage is much harder to determine. </p>

<p>This is how I see it:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">_
</code></pre>

<p>Should be used to indicate that a function is not for public use as for example an API. This and the import restriction make it behave much like <code>internal</code> in c#.</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">__
</code></pre>

<p>Should be used to avoid name collision in the inheritace hirarchy and to avoid latebinding. Much like private in c#.</p>

<p>==&gt; </p>

<p>If you want to indicate that something is not for public use, but it should act like <code>protected</code> use <code>_</code>.
If you want to indicate that something is not for public use, but it should act like <code>private</code> use <code>__</code>.</p>

<p>This is also a quote that I like very much:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem is that the author of a class may legitimately think "this
  attribute/method name should be private, only accessible from within
  this class definition" and use the __private convention. But later on,
  a user of that class may make a subclass that legitimately needs
  access to that name. So either the superclass has to be modified
  (which may be difficult or impossible), or the subclass code has to
  use manually mangled names (which is ugly and fragile at best).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the problem with that is in my opinion that if there's no IDE that warns you when you override methods, finding the error might take you a while if you have accidentially overriden a method from a base-class.</p>
