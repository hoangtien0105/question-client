The expression syntax is:\na if condition else b\n\nFirst condition is evaluated, then exactly one of either a or b is evaluated and returned based on the Boolean value of condition. If condition evaluates to True, then a is evaluated and returned but b is ignored, or else when b is evaluated and returned but a is ignored.\nThis allows short-circuiting because when condition is true only a is evaluated and b is not evaluated at all, but when condition is false only b is evaluated and a is not evaluated at all.\nFor example:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &apos;true&apos; if True else &apos;false&apos;\n&apos;true&apos;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &apos;true&apos; if False else &apos;false&apos;\n&apos;false&apos;\n\nNote that conditionals are an expression, not a statement. This means you can&apos;t use assignment statements or pass or other statements within a conditional expression:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pass if False else x = 3\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1\n    pass if False else x = 3\n          ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\nYou can, however, use conditional expressions to assign a variable like so:\nx = a if True else b\n\nThink of the conditional expression as switching between two values. It is very useful when you&apos;re in a &apos;one value or another&apos; situation, but it doesn&apos;t do much else.\nIf you need to use statements, you have to use a normal if statement instead of a conditional expression.\n\nKeep in mind that it&apos;s frowned upon by some Pythonistas for several reasons:\n\nThe order of the arguments is different from those of the classic condition ? a : b ternary operator from many other languages (such as C, C++, Go, Perl, Ruby, Java, JavaScript, etc.), which may lead to bugs when people unfamiliar with Python&apos;s &quot;surprising&quot; behaviour use it (they may reverse the argument order).\nSome find it &quot;unwieldy&quot;, since it goes contrary to the normal flow of thought (thinking of the condition first and then the effects).\nStylistic reasons. (Although the &apos;inline if&apos; can be really useful, and make your script more concise, it really does complicate your code)\n\nIf you&apos;re having trouble remembering the order, then remember that when read aloud, you (almost) say what you mean. For example, x = 4 if b &gt; 8 else 9 is read aloud as x will be 4 if b is greater than 8 otherwise 9.\nOfficial documentation:\n\nConditional expressions\nIs there an equivalent of Cs ?: ternary operator?\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You can index into a tuple:\n\n(falseValue, trueValue)[test]\n\n\ntest needs to return True or False.\nIt might be safer to always implement it as:\n\n(falseValue, trueValue)[test == True]\n\n\nor you can use the built-in bool() to assure a Boolean value:\n\n(falseValue, trueValue)[bool(&lt;expression&gt;)]\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"For versions prior to 2.5, there&apos;s the trick:\n[expression] and [on_true] or [on_false]\n\nIt can give wrong results when on_true has a false Boolean value.1\nAlthough it does have the benefit of evaluating expressions left to right, which is clearer in my opinion.\n1.

You could assign a whichever string isn&apos;t empty.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s1 = &apos;&apos;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s2 = &apos;hello world&apos;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = s1 or s2\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a\n&apos;hello world&apos;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nI always liked the C ternary syntax, but Python takes it a step further!\nI understand that some may say this isn&apos;t a good stylistic choice, because it relies on mechanics that aren&apos;t immediately apparent to all developers. I personally disagree with that viewpoint. Python is a syntax-rich language with lots of idiomatic tricks that aren&apos;t immediately apparent to the dabbler.

<p>Yes, it was <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2005-September/056846.html" rel="noreferrer" title="[Python-Dev] Conditional Expression Resolution">added</a> in version 2.5. The expression syntax is:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">a <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> condition <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> b
</code></pre>
<p>First <code>condition</code> is evaluated, then exactly one of either <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> is evaluated and returned based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type" rel="noreferrer" title="Boolean data type">Boolean</a> value of <code>condition</code>. If <code>condition</code> evaluates to <code>True</code>, then <code>a</code> is evaluated and returned but <code>b</code> is ignored, or else when <code>b</code> is evaluated and returned but <code>a</code> is ignored.</p>
<p>This allows short-circuiting because when <code>condition</code> is true only <code>a</code> is evaluated and <code>b</code> is not evaluated at all, but when <code>condition</code> is false only <code>b</code> is evaluated and <code>a</code> is not evaluated at all.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-string">'true'</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-literal">True</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-string">'false'</span>
<span class="hljs-string">'true'</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-string">'true'</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-literal">False</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-string">'false'</span>
<span class="hljs-string">'false'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Note that conditionals are an <em>expression</em>, not a <em>statement</em>. This means you can't use assignment statements or <code>pass</code> or other <strong>statements</strong> within a conditional <strong>expression</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-keyword">pass</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-literal">False</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> x = <span class="hljs-number">3</span>
  File <span class="hljs-string">"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span>, line <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">pass</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-literal">False</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> x = <span class="hljs-number">3</span>
          ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
</code></pre>
<p>You can, however, use conditional expressions to assign a variable like so:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">x = a <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-literal">True</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> b
</code></pre>
<p>Think of the conditional expression as switching between two values. It is very useful when you're in a 'one value or another' situation, but it doesn't do much else.</p>
<p>If you need to use statements, you have to use a normal <code>if</code> <strong>statement</strong> instead of a conditional <strong>expression</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Keep in mind that it's frowned upon by some Pythonistas for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The order of the arguments is different from those of the classic <code>condition ? a : b</code> ternary operator from many other languages (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29" rel="noreferrer">C</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" rel="noreferrer">C++</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29" rel="noreferrer">Go</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl" rel="noreferrer">Perl</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29" rel="noreferrer">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29" rel="noreferrer">Java</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" rel="noreferrer">JavaScript</a>, etc.), which may lead to bugs when people unfamiliar with Python's "surprising" behaviour use it (they may reverse the argument order).</li>
<li>Some find it "unwieldy", since it goes contrary to the normal flow of thought (thinking of the condition first and then the effects).</li>
<li>Stylistic reasons. (Although the 'inline <code>if</code>' can be <em>really</em> useful, and make your script more concise, it really does complicate your code)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're having trouble remembering the order, then remember that when read aloud, you (almost) say what you mean. For example, <code>x = 4 if b &gt; 8 else 9</code> is read aloud as <code>x will be 4 if b is greater than 8 otherwise 9</code>.</p>

<p>An operator for a conditional expression in Python was added in 2006 as part of <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0308/" rel="noreferrer">Python Enhancement Proposal 308</a>. Its form differ from common <code>?:</code> operator and it's:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">&lt;expression1&gt; <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> &lt;condition&gt; <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> &lt;expression2&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which is equivalent to:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> &lt;condition&gt;: &lt;expression1&gt; <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>: &lt;expression2&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">result = x <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> a &gt; b <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> y
</code></pre>

<p>Another syntax which can be used (compatible with versions before 2.5):</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">result = (<span class="hljs-keyword">lambda</span>:y, <span class="hljs-keyword">lambda</span>:x)[a &gt; b]()
</code></pre>

<p>where operands are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation" rel="noreferrer">lazily evaluated</a>.</p>

<p>Another way is by indexing a tuple (which isn't consistent with the conditional operator of most other languages):</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">result = (y, x)[a &gt; b]
</code></pre>

<p>or explicitly constructed dictionary:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">result = {<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>: x, <span class="hljs-literal">False</span>: y}[a &gt; b]
</code></pre>

<p>Another (less reliable), but simpler method is to use <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> operators:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">result = (a &gt; b) <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> x <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> y
</code></pre>

<p>however this won't work if <code>x</code> would be <code>False</code>.</p>

<p>A possible workaround is to make <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> lists or tuples as in the following:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">result = ((a &gt; b) <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> [x] <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> [y])[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">result = ((a &gt; b) <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> (x,) <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> (y,))[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]
</code></pre>

<p>If you're working with dictionaries, instead of using a ternary conditional, you can take advantage of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get" rel="noreferrer"><code>get(key, default)</code></a>, for example:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">shell = os.environ.get(<span class="hljs-string">'SHELL'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"/bin/sh"</span>)

<p>Unfortunately, the</p>

<p>solution doesn't have short-circuit behaviour; thus both <code>falseValue</code> and <code>trueValue</code> are evaluated regardless of the condition. This could be suboptimal or even buggy (i.e. both <code>trueValue</code> and <code>falseValue</code> could be methods and have side effects).</p>
<p>One solution to this would be</p>

<p>And so the story goes - choosing between three mentioned solutions is a trade-off between having the short-circuit feature, using at least Python 2.5 (IMHO, not a problem anymore) and not being prone to "<code>trueValue</code>-evaluates-to-false" errors.</p>

<p>For Python 2.5 and newer there is a specific syntax:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">[on_true] <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> [cond] <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> [on_false]

<p>In older Pythons a ternary operator is not implemented but it's possible to simulate it.</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">cond <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> on_true <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> on_false
</code></pre>

<p>Though, there is a potential problem, which if <code>cond</code> evaluates to <code>True</code> and <code>on_true</code> evaluates to <code>False</code> then <code>on_false</code> is returned instead of <code>on_true</code>. If you want this behavior the method is OK, otherwise use this:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">{<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>: on_true, <span class="hljs-literal">False</span>: on_false}[cond <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> <span class="hljs-literal">True</span>] <span class="hljs-comment"># is True, not == True</span>

<p>which can be wrapped by:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">q</span>(<span class="hljs-params">cond, on_true, on_false</span>)

<p>and used this way:</p>

<blockquote>
<h1>Does Python have a ternary conditional operator?</h1>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/reference/grammar.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">grammar file</a>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">test: or_test [<span class="hljs-string">'if'</span> or_test <span class="hljs-string">'else'</span> test] | lambdef
</code></pre>
<p>The part of interest is:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">or_test [<span class="hljs-string">'if'</span> or_test <span class="hljs-string">'else'</span> test]
</code></pre>
<p>So, a ternary conditional operation is of the form:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">expression1 <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> expression2 <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> expression3
</code></pre>
<p><code>expression3</code> will be lazily evaluated (that is, evaluated only if <code>expression2</code> is false in a boolean context). And because of the recursive definition, you can chain them indefinitely (though it may considered bad style.)</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">expression1 <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> expression2 <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> expression3 <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> expression4 <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> expression5 <span class="hljs-comment"># and so on</span>
</code></pre>
<h3>A note on usage:</h3>
<p>Note that every <code>if</code> must be followed with an <code>else</code>. People learning list comprehensions and generator expressions may find this to be a difficult lesson to learn - the following will not work, as Python expects a third expression for an else:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">[expression1 <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> expression2 <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> element <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> iterable]
<span class="hljs-comment">#                          ^-- need an else here</span>
</code></pre>
<p>which raises a <code>SyntaxError: invalid syntax</code>.
So the above is either an incomplete piece of logic (perhaps the user expects a no-op in the false condition) or what may be intended is to use <code>expression2</code> as a filter - notes that the following is legal Python:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">[expression1 <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> element <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> iterable <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> expression2]
</code></pre>
<p><code>expression2</code> works as a filter for the list comprehension, and is <em>not</em> a ternary conditional operator.</p>
<h3>Alternative syntax for a more narrow case:</h3>
<p>You may find it somewhat painful to write the following:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">expression1 <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> expression1 <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> expression2
</code></pre>
<p><code>expression1</code> will have to be evaluated twice with the above usage. It can limit redundancy if it is simply a local variable. However, a common and performant Pythonic idiom for this use-case is to use <code>or</code>'s shortcutting behavior:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">expression1 <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> expression2
</code></pre>
<p>which is equivalent in semantics. Note that some style-guides may limit this usage on the grounds of clarity - it does pack a lot of meaning into very little syntax.</p>

<p>As already answered, yes, there is a ternary operator in Python:</p>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>&lt;expression 1&gt; if &lt;condition&gt; else &lt;expression 2&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In many cases <code>&lt;expression 1&gt;</code> is also used as Boolean evaluated <code>&lt;condition&gt;</code>. Then you can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">short-circuit evaluation</a>.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">a = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
b = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>

<span class="hljs-comment"># Instead of this:</span>
x = a <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> a <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> b
<span class="hljs-comment"># Evaluates as 'a if bool(a) else b'</span>

<span class="hljs-comment"># You could use short-circuit evaluation:</span>
x = a <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> b
</code></pre>
<p>One big pro of short-circuit evaluation is the possibility of chaining more than two expressions:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">x = a <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> b <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> c <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> d <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> e

<p>When working with functions it is more different in detail:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-comment"># Evaluating functions:</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params">x</span>):

</code></pre>
<p>PS: Of course, a short-circuit evaluation is not a ternary operator, but often the ternary is used in cases where the short circuit would be enough. It has a better readability and can be chained.</p>

<p>Note that conditionals are an <em>expression</em>, not a <em>statement</em>. This means you can't use assignment statements or <code>pass</code> or other <strong>statements</strong> within a conditional <strong>expression</strong></p>

<h3>Walrus operator in Python 3.8</h3>
<p>After the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.html#assignment-expressions" rel="nofollow noreferrer">walrus operator</a> was introduced in Python 3.8, something changed.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">(a := <span class="hljs-number">3</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-literal">True</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> (b := <span class="hljs-number">5</span>)

<p>gives <code>c = 5</code>, <code>a is not defined</code> and <code>b = 5</code>.</p>
<p>Even if this may be ugly, <strong>assignments</strong> can be done <strong>inside</strong> conditional expressions after Python 3.8. Anyway, it is still better to use normal <code>if</code> <strong>statement</strong> instead in this case.</p>

<p>More a tip than an answer (I don't need to repeat the obvious for the hundredth time), but I sometimes use it as a one-liner shortcut in such constructs:</p>

<p>Some (many :) may frown upon it as unpythonic (even, Ruby-ish :), but I personally find it more natural - i.e., how you'd express it normally, plus a bit more visually appealing in large blocks of code.</p>

<p>You can do this:</p>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>[condition] and [expression_1] or [expression_2];
</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>print(number%2 and "odd" or "even")
</code></pre>
<p>This would print "odd" if the number is odd or "even" if the number is even.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The result:</strong> If condition is true, exp_1 is executed, else exp_2 is executed.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> 0, None, False, emptylist, and emptyString evaluates as False.</p>
<p>And any data other than 0 evaluates to True.</p>
<h2>Here's how it works:</h2>
<p>If the condition [condition] becomes "True", then expression_1 will be evaluated, but not expression_2.</p>
<p>If we "and" something with 0 (zero), the result will always to be false. So in the below statement,</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-number">0</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> exp
</code></pre>
<p>The expression <em>exp</em> won't be evaluated at all since "and" with 0 will always evaluate to zero and there is no need to evaluate the expression. This is how the compiler itself works, in all languages.</p>
<p>In</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-number">1</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> exp
</code></pre>
<p>the expression <em>exp</em> won't be evaluated at all since "or" with 1 will always be 1. So it won't bother to evaluate the expression exp since the result will be 1 anyway (compiler optimization methods).</p>
<p>But in case of</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-literal">True</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> exp1 <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> exp2
</code></pre>
<p>The second expression exp2 won't be evaluated since <code>True and exp1</code> would be True when exp1 isn't false.</p>
<p>Similarly in</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-literal">False</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> exp1 <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> exp2
</code></pre>
<p>The expression <em>exp1</em> won't be evaluated since False is equivalent to writing 0 and doing "and" with 0 would be 0 itself, but after exp1 since "or" is used, it will evaluate the expression exp2 after "or".</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Note:-</strong> This kind of branching using "or" and "and" can only be used when the expression_1 doesn't have a Truth value of False (or 0 or None or emptylist [ ] or emptystring ' '.) since if expression_1 becomes False, then the expression_2 will be evaluated because of the presence "or" between exp_1 and exp_2.</p>
<p><strong>In case you still want to make it work for all the cases regardless of what exp_1 and exp_2 truth values are, do this:</strong></p>

<p>Many programming languages derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29" rel="nofollow noreferrer">C</a> usually have the following syntax of the ternary conditional operator:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">&lt;condition&gt; ? &lt;expression1&gt; : &lt;expression2&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>At first, the Python's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life" rel="nofollow noreferrer">benevolent dictator for life</a> (I mean <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Guido van Rossum</a>, of course) rejected it (as non-Pythonic style), since it's quite hard to understand for people not used to C language. Also, the colon sign <strong><code>:</code></strong> already has many uses in Python. After <strong>PEP 308</strong> was approved, Python finally received its own shortcut conditional expression (what we use now):</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">&lt;expression1&gt; <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> &lt;condition&gt; <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> &lt;expression2&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So, firstly it evaluates the condition. If it returns <code>True</code>, <strong>expression1</strong> will be evaluated to give the result, otherwise <strong>expression2</strong> will be evaluated. Due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lazy evaluation</a> mechanics  only one expression will be executed.</p>
<p>Here are some examples (conditions will be evaluated from left to right):</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">pressure = <span class="hljs-number">10</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'High'</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> pressure &lt; <span class="hljs-number">20</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-string">'Critical'</span>)

<span class="hljs-comment"># Result is 'High'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Ternary operators can be chained in series:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">pressure = <span class="hljs-number">5</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Normal'</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> pressure &lt; <span class="hljs-number">10</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-string">'High'</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> pressure &lt; <span class="hljs-number">20</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-string">'Critical'</span>)

<p>Other answers correctly talk about the Python ternary operator. I would like to complement by mentioning a scenario for which the ternary operator is often used, but for which there is a better idiom. This is the scenario of using a default value.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to use <code>option_value</code> with a default value if it is not set:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">run_algorithm(option_value <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> option_value <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> <span class="hljs-literal">None</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-number">10</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>or, if <code>option_value</code> is never set to a falsy value (<code>0</code>, <code>""</code>, etc.), simply</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">run_algorithm(option_value <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> option_value <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-number">10</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>However, in this case an ever better solution is simply to write</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">run_algorithm(option_value <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> <span class="hljs-number">10</span>)

<p>The syntax for the ternary operator in Python is:</p>
<p><code>[on_true] if [expression] else [on_false]</code></p>
<p>Using that syntax, here is how we would rewrite the code above using Pythons ternary operator:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">game_type = <span class="hljs-string">'home'</span>
shirt = <span class="hljs-string">'white'</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> game_type == <span class="hljs-string">'home'</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-string">'green'</span>

</code></pre>
<p>It's still pretty clear, but much shorter. Note that the expression could be any type of expression, including a function call, that returns a value that evaluates to True or False.</p>

<p>Python has a ternary form for assignments; however there may be even a shorter form that people should be aware of.</p>
<p>It's very common to need to assign to a variable one value or another depending on a condition.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>li1 = <span class="hljs-literal">None</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>li2 = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> li1:
<span class="hljs-meta">... </span>    a = li1
<span class="hljs-meta">... </span><span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
<span class="hljs-meta">... </span>    a = li2
...
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>^ This is the long form for doing such assignments.</p>
<p>Below is the ternary form. But this isn't the most succinct way - see the last example.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = li1 <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> li1 <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> li2
&gt;&gt;&gt;
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>With Python, you can simply use <code>or</code> for alternative assignments.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = li1 <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> li2
&gt;&gt;&gt;
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The above works since <code>li1</code> is <code>None</code> and the interpreter treats that as False in logic expressions. The interpreter then moves on and evaluates the second expression, which is not <code>None</code> and it's not an empty list - so it gets assigned to <em>a</em>.</p>
<p>This also works with empty lists. For instance, if you want to assign <code>a</code> whichever list has items.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>li1 = []
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>li2 = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = li1 <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> li2
&gt;&gt;&gt;
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>]
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Knowing this, you can simply such assignments whenever you encounter them. This also works with strings and other iterables. You could assign <code>a</code> whichever string isn't empty.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>s1 = <span class="hljs-string">''</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>s2 = <span class="hljs-string">'hello world'</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt;
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a = s1 <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> s2
&gt;&gt;&gt;
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>a
<span class="hljs-string">'hello world'</span>
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I always liked the C ternary syntax, but Python takes it a step further!</p>
<p>I understand that some may say this isn't a good stylistic choice, because it relies on mechanics that aren't immediately apparent to all developers. I personally disagree with that viewpoint. Python is a syntax-rich language with lots of idiomatic tricks that aren't immediately apparent to the dabbler. But the more you learn and understand the mechanics of the underlying system, the more you appreciate it.</p>

<p>I find the default Python syntax <code>val = a if cond else b</code> cumbersome, so sometimes I do this:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">iif = <span class="hljs-keyword">lambda</span> (cond, a, b): a <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> cond <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> b

<p>Of course, it has the downside of always evaluating both sides (<em>a</em> and <em>b</em>), but the syntax is way clearer to me.</p>
