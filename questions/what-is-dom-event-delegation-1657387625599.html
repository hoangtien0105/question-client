Bubbling\n  events will then trigger any\n  additional event listeners found by\n  following the EventTarget&apos;s parent\n  chain upward, checking for any event\n  listeners registered on each\n  successive EventTarget. This upward\n  propagation will continue up to and\n  including the Document.\n\n\nEvent bubbling provides the foundation for event delegation in browsers. Now you can bind an event handler to a single parent element, and that handler will get executed whenever the event occurs on any of its child nodes (and any of their children in turn). This is event delegation. Here&apos;s an example of it in practice:\n\n&lt;ul onclick=&quot;alert(event.type + &apos;!&apos;)&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;One&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;Two&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;li&gt;Three&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\nWith that example if you were to click on any of the child &lt;li&gt; nodes, you would see an alert of &quot;click!&quot;, even though there is no click handler bound to the &lt;li&gt; you clicked on. If we bound onclick=&quot;...&quot; to each &lt;li&gt; you would get the same effect.\n\nSo what&apos;s the benefit?\n\nImagine you now have a need to dynamically add new &lt;li&gt; items to the above list via DOM manipulation:\n\nvar newLi = document.createElement(&apos;li&apos;);\nnewLi.innerHTML = &apos;Four&apos;;\nmyUL.appendChild(newLi);\n\n\nWithout using event delegation you would have to &quot;rebind&quot; the &quot;onclick&quot; event handler to the new &lt;li&gt; element, in order for it to act the same way as its siblings. With event delegation you don&apos;t need to do anything. Just add the new &lt;li&gt; to the list and you&apos;re done.\n\nThis is absolutely fantastic for web apps with event handlers bound to many elements, where new elements are dynamically created and/or removed in the DOM. With event delegation the number of event bindings can be drastically decreased by moving them to a common parent element, and code that dynamically creates new elements on the fly can be decoupled from the logic of binding their event handlers.\n\nAnother benefit to event delegation is that the total memory footprint used by event listeners goes down (since the number of event bindings go down). It may not make much of a difference to small pages that unload often (i.e. user&apos;s navigate to different pages often). But for long-lived applications it can be significant. There are some really difficult-to-track-down situations when elements removed from the DOM still claim memory (i.e. they leak), and often this leaked memory is tied to an event binding. With event delegation you&apos;re free to destroy child elements without risk of forgetting to &quot;unbind&quot; their event listeners (since the listener is on the ancestor). These types of memory leaks can then be contained (if not eliminated, which is freaking hard to do sometimes. IE I&apos;m looking at you).\n\nHere are some better concrete code examples of event delegation:\n\n\nHow JavaScript Event Delegation Works\nEvent Delegation versus Event Handling\njQuery.delegate is event delegation + selector specification\njQuery.on uses event delegation when passed a selector as the 2nd parameter\nEvent delegation without a JavaScript library\nClosures vs Event delegation: takes a look at the pros of not converting code to use event delegation\nInteresting approach PPK uncovered for delegating the focus and blur events (which do not bubble)\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Event delegation allows you to avoid adding event listeners to specific nodes;  instead, the event listener is added to one parent.  That event listener analyzes bubbled events to find a match on child elements.\nJavaScript Example :\nLet&apos;s say that we have a parent UL element with several child elements:\n&lt;ul id=&quot;parent-list&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;li id=&quot;post-1&quot;&gt;Item 1&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li id=&quot;post-2&quot;&gt;Item 2&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li id=&quot;post-3&quot;&gt;Item 3&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li id=&quot;post-4&quot;&gt;Item 4&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li id=&quot;post-5&quot;&gt;Item 5&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li id=&quot;post-6&quot;&gt;Item 6&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\nLet&apos;s also say that something needs to happen when each child element is clicked.  You could add a separate event listener to each individual LI element, but what if LI elements are frequently added and removed from the list?  Adding and removing event listeners would be a nightmare, especially if addition and removal code is in different places within your app.  The better solution is to add an event listener to the parent UL element.  But if you add the event listener to the parent, how will you know which element was clicked?\nSimple:  when the event bubbles up to the UL element, you check the event object&apos;s target property to gain a reference to the actual clicked node.  Here&apos;s a very basic JavaScript snippet which illustrates event delegation:\n// Get the element, add a click listener...\ndocument.getElementById(&quot;parent-list&quot;).addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, function(e) {\n  // e.target is the clicked element!\n  // If it was a list item\n  if(e.target &amp;&amp; e.target.nodeName == &quot;LI&quot;) {\n    // List item found!  Output the ID!\n    console.log(&quot;List item &quot;, e.target.id.replace(&quot;post-&quot;), &quot; was clicked!&quot;);\n   }\n});\n\nStart by adding a click event listener to the parent element.  When the event listener is triggered, check the event element to ensure it&apos;s the type of element to react to.  If it is an LI element, boom:  we have what we need!  If it&apos;s not an element that we want, the event can be ignored.  This example is pretty simple -- UL and LI is a straight-forward comparison.  Let&apos;s try something more difficult.  Let&apos;s have a parent DIV with many children but all we care about is an A tag with the classA CSS class:\n// Get the parent DIV, add click listener...\ndocument.getElementById(&quot;myDiv&quot;).addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;,function(e) {\n// e.target was the clicked element\n  if(e.target &amp;&amp; e.target.nodeName == &quot;A&quot;) {\n    // Get the CSS classes\n    var classes = e.target.className.split(&quot; &quot;);\n    // Search for the CSS class!\n    if(classes) {\n        // For every CSS class the element has...\n        for(var x = 0; x &lt; classes.length; x++) {\n            // If it has the CSS class we want...\n            if(classes[x] == &quot;classA&quot;) {\n                // Bingo!\n                console.log(&quot;Anchor element clicked!&quot;);\n                // Now do something here....\n            }\n        }\n    }\n  }\n});\n\nhttp://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"dom event delegation is something different from the computer science definition.\n\nIt refers to handling bubbling events from many elements, like table cells, from a parent object, like the table.

This can simplify handling events on elements within the container.\n\nFor instance, suppose you want to handle a click on any table cell in a big table. You could write a loop to hook up a click handler to each cell...or you could hook up a click handler on the table and use event delegation to trigger it only for table cells (and not table headers, or the whitespace within a row around cells, etc.).\n\nIt&apos;s also useful when you&apos;re going to be adding and removing elements from the container, because you don&apos;t have to worry about adding and removing event handlers on those elements; just hook the event on the container and handle the event when it bubbles.\n\nHere&apos;s a simple example (it&apos;s intentionally verbose to allow for inline explanation): Handling a click on any td element in a container table:\n\n\n\n// Handle the event on the container\ndocument.getElementById(&quot;container&quot;).addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, function(event) {\n    // Find out if the event targeted or bubbled through a `td` en route to this container element\n    var element = event.target;\n    var target;\n    while (element &amp;&amp; !target) {\n        if (element.matches(&quot;td&quot;)) {\n            // Found a `td` within the container!\n            target = element;\n        } else {\n            // Not found\n            if (element === this) {\n                // We&apos;ve reached the container, stop\n                element = null;\n            } else {\n                // Go to the next parent in the ancestry\n                element = element.parentNode;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    if (target) {\n        console.log(&quot;You clicked a td: &quot; + target.textContent);\n    } else {\n        console.log(&quot;That wasn&apos;t a td in the container table&quot;);\n    }\n});\ntable {\n    border-collapse: collapse;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n}\nth, td {\n    padding: 4px;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    font-weight: normal;\n}\nth.rowheader {\n    text-align: left;\n}\ntd {\n    cursor: pointer;\n}\n&lt;table id=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;thead&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;\n            &lt;th&gt;Language&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;/thead&gt;\n    &lt;tbody&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;\n            &lt;th class=&quot;rowheader&quot;&gt;English&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;one&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;two&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;three&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;\n            &lt;th class=&quot;rowheader&quot;&gt;Español&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;uno&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;dos&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;tres&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;\n            &lt;th class=&quot;rowheader&quot;&gt;Italiano&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;uno&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;due&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;tre&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\nBefore going into the details of that, let&apos;s remind ourselves how DOM events work.\n\nDOM events are dispatched from the document to the target element (the capturing phase), and then bubble from the target element back to the document (the bubbling phase). This graphic in the old DOM3 events spec (now superceded, but the graphic&apos;s still valid) shows it really well:\n\n\n\nNot all events bubble, but most do, including click.\n\nThe comments in the code example above describe how it works. matches checks to see if an element matches a CSS selector, but of course you can check for whether something matches your criteria in other ways if you don&apos;t want to use a CSS selector.\n\nThat code is written to call out the individual steps verbosely, but on vaguely-modern browsers (and also on IE if you use a polyfill), you can use closest and contains instead of the loop:\n\nvar target = event.target.closest(&quot;td&quot;);\n    console.log(&quot;You clicked a td: &quot; + target.textContent);\n} else {\n    console.log(&quot;That wasn&apos;t a td in the container table&quot;);\n}\n\n\nLive Example:\n\nShow code snippet\n\n// Handle the event on the container\ndocument.getElementById(&quot;container&quot;).addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, function(event) {\n    var target = event.target.closest(&quot;td&quot;);\n    if (target &amp;&amp; this.contains(target)) {\n        console.log(&quot;You clicked a td: &quot; + target.textContent);\n    } else {\n        console.log(&quot;That wasn&apos;t a td in the container table&quot;);\n    }\n});\ntable {\n    border-collapse: collapse;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n}\nth, td {\n    padding: 4px;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    font-weight: normal;\n}\nth.rowheader {\n    text-align: left;\n}\ntd {\n    cursor: pointer;\n}\n&lt;table id=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;thead&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;\n            &lt;th&gt;Language&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;/thead&gt;\n    &lt;tbody&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;\n            &lt;th class=&quot;rowheader&quot;&gt;English&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;one&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;two&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;three&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;\n            &lt;th class=&quot;rowheader&quot;&gt;Español&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;uno&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;dos&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;tres&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;\n            &lt;th class=&quot;rowheader&quot;&gt;Italiano&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;uno&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;due&lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;tre&lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\nclosest checks the element you call it on to see if it matches the given CSS selector and, if it does, returns that same element; if not, it checks the parent element to see if it matches, and returns the parent if so; if not, it checks the parent&apos;s parent, etc. So it finds the &quot;closest&quot; element in the ancestor list that matches the selector. Since that might go past the container element, the code above uses contains to check that if a matching element was found, it&apos;s within the container  since by hooking the event on the container, you&apos;ve indicated you only want to handle elements within that container.\n\nGoing back to our table example, that means that if you have a table within a table cell, it won&apos;t match the table cell containing the table:\n\nShow code snippet\n\n// Handle the event on the container\ndocument.getElementById(&quot;container&quot;).addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, function(event) {\n    var target = event.target.closest(&quot;td&quot;);\n    if (target &amp;&amp; this.contains(target)) {\n        console.log(&quot;You clicked a td: &quot; + target.textContent);\n    } else {\n        console.log(&quot;That wasn&apos;t a td in the container table&quot;);\n    }\n});\ntable {\n    border-collapse: collapse;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n}\nth, td {\n    padding: 4px;\n    border: 1px solid #ddd;\n    font-weight: normal;\n}\nth.rowheader {\n    text-align: left;\n}\ntd {\n    cursor: pointer;\n}\n&lt;!-- The table wrapped around the #container table --&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n    &lt;tbody&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;\n                &lt;!-- This cell doesn&apos;t get matched, thanks to the `this.contains(target)` check --&gt;\n                &lt;table id=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;thead&gt;\n                        &lt;tr&gt;\n                            &lt;th&gt;Language&lt;/th&gt;\n                            &lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;\n                            &lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;\n                            &lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;\n                        &lt;/tr&gt;\n                    &lt;/thead&gt;\n                    &lt;tbody&gt;\n                        &lt;tr&gt;\n                            &lt;th class=&quot;rowheader&quot;&gt;English&lt;/th&gt;\n                            &lt;td&gt;one&lt;/td&gt;\n                            &lt;td&gt;two&lt;/td&gt;\n                            &lt;td&gt;three&lt;/td&gt;\n                        &lt;/tr&gt;\n                        &lt;tr&gt;\n                            &lt;th class=&quot;rowheader&quot;&gt;Español&lt;/th&gt;\n                            &lt;td&gt;uno&lt;/td&gt;\n                            &lt;td&gt;dos&lt;/td&gt;\n                            &lt;td&gt;tres&lt;/td&gt;\n                        &lt;/tr&gt;\n                        &lt;tr&gt;\n                            &lt;th class=&quot;rowheader&quot;&gt;Italiano&lt;/th&gt;\n                            &lt;td&gt;uno&lt;/td&gt;\n                            &lt;td&gt;due&lt;/td&gt;\n                            &lt;td&gt;tre&lt;/td&gt;\n                        &lt;/tr&gt;\n                    &lt;/tbody&gt;\n                &lt;/table&gt;\n            &lt;/td&gt;\n            &lt;td&gt;\n                This is next to the container table\n            &lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Delegation is a technique where an object expresses certain behavior to the outside but in reality delegates responsibility for implementing that behaviour to an associated object. This sounds at first very similar to the proxy pattern, but it serves a much different purpose. Delegation is an abstraction mechanism which centralizes object (method) behavior.\n\nGenerally spoken: use delegation as alternative to inheritance. Inheritance is a good strategy, when a close relationship exist in between parent and child object, however, inheritance couples objects very closely. Often, delegation is the more flexible way to express a relationship between classes.\n\nThis pattern is also known as &quot;proxy chains&quot;. Several other design patterns use delegation - the State, Strategy and Visitor Patterns depend on it.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"The delegation concept\nIf there are many elements inside one parent, and you want to handle events on them of them - dont bind handlers to each element.\nInstead, bind the single handler to their parent, and get the child from event.target.\nThis site provides useful info about how to implement event delegation.\nhttp://javascript.info/tutorial/event-delegation\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution6","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"To understand event delegation first we need to know why and when we actually need or want event delegation.\n\nThere may be many cases but let&apos;s discuss two big use cases for event delegation.\n1. The first case is when we have an element with lots of child elements that we are interested in. In this case, instead of adding an event handler to all of these child elements, we simply add it to the parent element and then determine on which child element the event was fired. \n\n2.The second use case for event delegation is when we want an event handler attached to an element that is not yet in the DOM when our page is loaded. That&apos;s, of course, because we cannot add an event handler to something that&apos;s not on our page, so in a case of deprecation that we&apos;re coding.\n\nSuppose you have a list of 0, 10, or 100 items in the DOM when you load your page, and more items are waiting in your hand to add in the list. So there is no way to attach an event handler for the future elements or those elements are not added in the DOM yet, and also there may be a lot of items, so it wouldn&apos;t be useful to have one event handler attached to each of them.\n\nEvent Delegation\n\nAll right, so in order to talk about event delegation, the first concept that we actually need to talk about is event bubbling.\n\nEvent bubbling:\nEvent bubbling means that when an event is fired or triggered on some DOM element, for example by clicking on our button here on the bellow image, then the exact same event is also triggered on all of the parent elements.\n\n\n\nThe event is first fired on the button, but then it will also be fired on all the parent elements one at a time, so it will also fire on the paragraph to the  section the main element and actually all the way up in a DOM tree until the HTML element which is the root. So we say that the event bubbles up inside the DOM tree, and that&apos;s why it&apos;s called bubbling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget element: The element on which the event was actually first fired called the target element, so the element that caused the event to happen, is called the target element. In our above example here it&apos;s, of course, the button that was clicked. The important part is that this target element is stored as a property in the event object, This means that all the parent elements on which the event will also fire will know the target element of the event, so where the event was first fired.\n\nThat brings us to event delegation because if the event bubbles up in the DOM tree, and if we know where the event was fired then we can simply attach an event handler to a parent element and wait for the event to bubble up, and we can then do whatever we intended to do with our target element. This technique is called event delegation. In this example here, we could simply add the event handler\nto the main element.\n\nAll right, so again, event delegation is to not set up the event handler on the original element that we&apos;re interested in but to attach it to a parent element and, basically, catch the event there because it bubbles up. We can then act on the element that we&apos;re interested in using the target element property.\n\nExample:\nNow lets assume we have two list item in our page, after adding items in those list programmtically we want to delete one or more items from them. Using event delegation tecnique we can achive our ppurpose easily.\n\n&lt;div class=&quot;body&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;top&quot;&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;div class=&quot;bottom&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;other&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;!-- other bottom elements --&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div class=&quot;container clearfix&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;income&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;h2 class=&quot;icome__title&quot;&gt;Income&lt;/h2&gt;\n                &lt;div class=&quot;income__list&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;!-- list items --&gt;\n                &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;expenses&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;h2 class=&quot;expenses__title&quot;&gt;Expenses&lt;/h2&gt;\n                &lt;div class=&quot;expenses__list&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;!-- list items --&gt;\n                &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nAdding items in those list:\n\nconst DOMstrings={\n        type:{\n            income:&apos;inc&apos;,\n            expense:&apos;exp&apos;\n        },\n        incomeContainer:&apos;.income__list&apos;,\n        expenseContainer:&apos;.expenses__list&apos;,\n        container:&apos;.container&apos;\n   }\n\n\nvar addListItem = function(obj, type){\n        //create html string with the place holder\n        var html, element;\n        if(type===DOMstrings.type.income){\n            element = DOMstrings.incomeContainer\n            html = `&lt;div class=&quot;item clearfix&quot; id=&quot;inc-${obj.id}&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;item__description&quot;&gt;${obj.descripiton}&lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;right clearfix&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;div class=&quot;item__value&quot;&gt;${obj.value}&lt;/div&gt;\n                &lt;div class=&quot;item__delete&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;button class=&quot;item__delete--btn&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;ion-ios-close-outline&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;\n                &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;`\n        }else if (type ===DOMstrings.type.expense){\n            element=DOMstrings.expenseContainer;\n            html = ` &lt;div class=&quot;item clearfix&quot; id=&quot;exp-${obj.id}&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;item__description&quot;&gt;${obj.descripiton}&lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;div class=&quot;right clearfix&quot;&gt;\n                &lt;div class=&quot;item__value&quot;&gt;${obj.value}&lt;/div&gt;\n                &lt;div class=&quot;item__percentage&quot;&gt;21%&lt;/div&gt;\n                &lt;div class=&quot;item__delete&quot;&gt;\n                    &lt;button class=&quot;item__delete--btn&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;ion-ios-close-outline&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;\n                &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;/div&gt;`\n        }\n        var htmlObject = document.createElement(&apos;div&apos;);\n        htmlObject.innerHTML=html;\n        document.querySelector(element).insertAdjacentElement(&apos;beforeend&apos;, htmlObject);\n    }\n\n\nDelete items:\n\nvar ctrlDeleteItem = function(event){\n       // var itemId = event.target.parentNode.parentNode.parentNode.parentNode.id;\n        var parent = event.target.parentNode;\n        var splitId, type, ID;\n        while(parent.id===&quot;&quot;){\n            parent = parent.parentNode\n        }\n        if(parent.id){\n            splitId = parent.id.split(&apos;-&apos;);\n            type = splitId[0];\n            ID=parseInt(splitId[1]);\n        }\n\n        deleteItem(type, ID);\n        deleteListItem(parent.id);\n }\n\n var deleteItem = function(type, id){\n        var ids, index;\n        ids = data.allItems[type].map(function(current){\n            return current.id;\n        });\n        index = ids.indexOf(id);\n        if(index&gt;-1){\n            data.allItems[type].splice(index,1);\n        }\n    }\n\n  var deleteListItem = function(selectorID){\n        var element = document.getElementById(selectorID);\n        element.parentNode.removeChild(element);\n    }\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution7","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"It&apos;s basically how association is made to the element. .click applies to the current DOM, while .on (using delegation) will continue to be valid for new elements added to the DOM after event association.\n\nWhich is better to use, I&apos;d say it depends on the case.\n\nExample:\n\n&lt;ul id=&quot;todo&quot;&gt;\n   &lt;li&gt;Do 1&lt;/li&gt;\n   &lt;li&gt;Do 2&lt;/li&gt;\n   &lt;li&gt;Do 3&lt;/li&gt;\n   &lt;li&gt;Do 4&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n.Click Event:\n\n$(&quot;li&quot;).click(function () {\n   $(this).remove ();\n});\n\n\nEvent .on:\n\n$(&quot;#todo&quot;).on(&quot;click&quot;, &quot;li&quot;, function () {\n   $(this).remove();\n});\n\n\nNote that I&apos;ve separated the selector in the .on.

<p>DOM event delegation is a mechanism of responding to ui-events via a single common parent rather than each child, through the magic of event "bubbling" (aka event propagation).</p>

<p>When an event is triggered on an element, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-flow-bubbling" rel="noreferrer">the following occurs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The event is dispatched to its target
  <code>EventTarget</code> and any event listeners
  found there are triggered. <em>Bubbling</em>
  events will then trigger any
  additional event listeners found by
  following the <code>EventTarget</code>'s parent
  chain <em>upward</em>, checking for any event
  listeners registered on each
  successive EventTarget. This upward
  propagation will continue up to and
  including the <code>Document</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Event bubbling provides the foundation for event delegation in browsers. Now you can bind an event handler to a single parent element, and that handler will get executed whenever the event occurs <em>on any of its child nodes</em> (and any of their children in turn). <strong>This is event delegation.</strong> Here's an example of it in practice:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;ul onclick=<span class="hljs-string">"alert(event.type + '!')"</span>&gt;
    <span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span>One<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span>Two<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span>Three<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span></span>
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With that example if you were to click on any of the child <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> nodes, you would see an alert of <code>"click!"</code>, even though there is no click handler bound to the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> you clicked on. If we bound <code>onclick="..."</code> to each <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> you would get the same effect.</p>

<p><strong>So what's the benefit?</strong></p>

<p>Imagine you now have a need to dynamically add new <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> items to the above list via DOM manipulation:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> newLi = <span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">createElement</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'li'</span>);
newLi.<span class="hljs-property">innerHTML</span> = <span class="hljs-string">'Four'</span>;
myUL.<span class="hljs-title function_">appendChild</span>(newLi);
</code></pre>

<p><em>Without</em> using event delegation you would have to "rebind" the <code>"onclick"</code> event handler to the new <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element, in order for it to act the same way as its siblings. <em>With</em> event delegation you don't need to do anything. Just add the new <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> to the list and you're done.</p>

<p>This is absolutely fantastic for web apps with event handlers bound to many elements, where new elements are dynamically created and/or removed in the DOM. With event delegation the number of event bindings can be drastically decreased by moving them to a common parent element, and code that dynamically creates new elements on the fly can be decoupled from the logic of binding their event handlers.</p>

<p>Another benefit to event delegation is that the total memory footprint used by event listeners goes down (since the number of event bindings go down). It may not make much of a difference to small pages that unload often (i.e. user's navigate to different pages often). But for long-lived applications it can be significant. There are some really difficult-to-track-down situations when elements removed from the DOM still claim memory (i.e. they leak), and often this leaked memory is tied to an event binding. With event delegation you're free to destroy child elements without risk of forgetting to "unbind" their event listeners (since the listener is on the ancestor). These types of memory leaks can then be contained (if not eliminated, which is freaking hard to do sometimes. IE I'm looking at you).</p>

<p>Event delegation allows you to avoid adding event listeners to specific nodes;  instead, the event listener is added to one parent.  That event listener analyzes bubbled events to find a match on child elements.</p>

<p>Let's also say that something needs to happen when each child element is clicked.  You could add a separate event listener to each individual LI element, but what if LI elements are frequently added and removed from the list?  Adding and removing event listeners would be a nightmare, especially if addition and removal code is in different places within your app.  The better solution is to add an event listener to the parent UL element.  But if you add the event listener to the parent, how will you know which element was clicked?</p>
<p>Simple:  when the event bubbles up to the UL element, you check the event object's target property to gain a reference to the actual clicked node.  Here's a very basic JavaScript snippet which illustrates event delegation:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// Get the element, add a click listener...</span>
<span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">getElementById</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"parent-list"</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">addEventListener</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"click"</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">e</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-comment">// e.target is the clicked element!</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">// If it was a list item</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(e.<span class="hljs-property">target</span> &amp;&amp; e.<span class="hljs-property">target</span>.<span class="hljs-property">nodeName</span> == <span class="hljs-string">"LI"</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// List item found!  Output the ID!</span>
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"List item "</span>, e.<span class="hljs-property">target</span>.<span class="hljs-property">id</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"post-"</span>), <span class="hljs-string">" was clicked!"</span>);
   }
});
</code></pre>
<p>Start by adding a click event listener to the parent element.  When the event listener is triggered, check the event element to ensure it's the type of element to react to.  If it is an LI element, boom:  we have what we need!  If it's not an element that we want, the event can be ignored.  This example is pretty simple -- UL and LI is a straight-forward comparison.  Let's try something more difficult.  Let's have a parent DIV with many children but all we care about is an A tag with the classA CSS class:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// Get the parent DIV, add click listener...</span>
<span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">getElementById</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"myDiv"</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">addEventListener</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"click"</span>,<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">e</span>) {

                <span class="hljs-comment">// Now do something here....</span>
            }
        }
    }

<p><strong>dom event delegation</strong> is something different from the computer science definition.</p>

<p>It refers to handling bubbling events from many elements, like table cells, from a parent object, like the table. It can keep the code simpler, especially when adding or removing elements, and saves some memory.</p>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution4" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl border p-10 shadow-md w-9/12 bg-white"><h4 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 4</h4><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>Event delegation is handling an event that <em>bubbles</em> using an event handler on a container element, but only activating the event handler's behavior if the event happened on an element within the container that matches a given condition. This can simplify handling events on elements within the container.</p>

<p>For instance, suppose you want to handle a click on any table cell in a big table. You <em>could</em> write a loop to hook up a click handler to each cell...or you could hook up a click handler on the table and use event delegation to trigger it only for table cells (and not table headers, or the whitespace within a row around cells, etc.).</p>

<p>It's also useful when you're going to be adding and removing elements from the container, because you don't have to worry about adding and removing event handlers on those elements; just hook the event on the container and handle the event when it bubbles.</p>

<p>Here's a simple example (it's intentionally verbose to allow for inline explanation): Handling a click on any <code>td</code> element in a container table:</p>

<p>Before going into the details of that, let's remind ourselves how DOM events work.</p>

<p>DOM events are dispatched from the document to the target element (the <em>capturing</em> phase), and then bubble from the target element back to the document (the <em>bubbling</em> phase). This graphic in the old <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#event-flow" rel="noreferrer">DOM3 events spec</a> (now superceded, but the graphic's still valid) shows it really well:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y3dk9.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y3dk9.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Not all events bubble, but most do, including <code>click</code>.</p>

<p>The comments in the code example above describe how it works. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/matches" rel="noreferrer"><code>matches</code></a> checks to see if an element matches a CSS selector, but of course you can check for whether something matches your criteria in other ways if you don't want to use a CSS selector.</p>

<p>That code is written to call out the individual steps verbosely, but on vaguely-modern browsers (and also on IE if you use a polyfill), you can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/closest" rel="noreferrer"><code>closest</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/contains" rel="noreferrer"><code>contains</code></a> instead of the loop:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> target = event.<span class="hljs-property">target</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">closest</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"td"</span>);
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"You clicked a td: "</span> + target.<span class="hljs-property">textContent</span>);

<p><code>closest</code> checks the element you call it on to see if it matches the given CSS selector and, if it does, returns that same element; if not, it checks the parent element to see if it matches, and returns the parent if so; if not, it checks the parent's parent, etc. So it finds the "closest" element in the ancestor list that matches the selector. Since that might go past the container element, the code above uses <code>contains</code> to check that if a matching element was found, it's within the container&nbsp; since by hooking the event on the container, you've indicated you only want to handle elements <em>within</em> that container.</p>

<p>Going back to our table example, that means that if you have a table within a table cell, it won't match the table cell containing the table:</p>

<p><a href="http://best-practice-software-engineering.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/patterns/delegation.html" rel="noreferrer">Delegation</a> is a technique where an object expresses certain behavior to the outside but in reality delegates responsibility for implementing that behaviour to an associated object. This sounds at first very similar to the proxy pattern, but it serves a much different purpose. Delegation is an abstraction mechanism which centralizes object (method) behavior.</p>

<p>Generally spoken: use delegation as alternative to inheritance. Inheritance is a good strategy, when a close relationship exist in between parent and child object, however, inheritance couples objects very closely. Often, delegation is the more flexible way to express a relationship between classes.</p>

<p>This pattern is also known as "proxy chains". Several other design patterns use delegation - the State, Strategy and Visitor Patterns depend on it.</p>

<h3>The delegation concept</h3>
<p>If there are many elements inside one parent, and you want to handle events on them of them - dont bind handlers to each element.
Instead, bind the single handler to their parent, and get the child from event.target.
This site provides useful info about how to implement event delegation.

<p>To understand event delegation first we need to know why and when we actually need or want event delegation.</p>

<p>There may be many cases but let's discuss two big use cases for event delegation.
1. The first case is when we have an element with lots of child elements that we are interested in. In this case, instead of adding an event handler to all of these child elements, we simply add it to the parent element and then determine on which child element the event was fired. </p>

<p>2.The second use case for event delegation is when we want an event handler attached to an element that is not yet in the DOM when our page is loaded. That's, of course, because we cannot add an event handler to something that's not on our page, so in a case of deprecation that we're coding.</p>

<p>Suppose you have a list of 0, 10, or 100 items in the DOM when you load your page, and more items are waiting in your hand to add in the list. So there is no way to attach an event handler for the future elements or those elements are not added in the DOM yet, and also there may be a lot of items, so it wouldn't be useful to have one event handler attached to each of them.</p>

<p><strong>Event Delegation</strong></p>

<p>All right, so in order to talk about event delegation, the first concept that we actually need to talk about is event bubbling.</p>

<p><strong>Event bubbling:</strong>
Event bubbling means that when an event is fired or triggered on some DOM element, for example by clicking on our button here on the bellow image, then the exact same event is also triggered on all of the parent elements.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pcbPG.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pcbPG.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>The event is first fired on the button, but then it will also be fired on all the parent elements one at a time, so it will also fire on the paragraph to the  section the main element and actually all the way up in a DOM tree until the HTML element which is the root. So we say that the event bubbles up inside the DOM tree, and that's why it's called bubbling.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sCEZA.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/sCEZA.jpg" alt="1"></a>
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VNtwk.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VNtwk.jpg" alt="2"></a>
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0ONWn.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/0ONWn.jpg" alt="3"></a>
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QX0Iy.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QX0Iy.jpg" alt="4"></a></p>

<p><strong>Target element:</strong> The element on which the event was actually first fired called the target element, so the element that caused the event to happen, is called the target element. In our above example here it's, of course, the button that was clicked. The important part is that this target element is stored as a property in the event object, This means that all the parent elements on which the event will also fire will know the target element of the event, so where the event was first fired.</p>

<p><strong>That brings us to event delegation</strong> because if the event bubbles up in the DOM tree, and if we know where the event was fired then we can simply attach an event handler to a parent element and wait for the event to bubble up, and we can then do whatever we intended to do with our target element. This technique is called event delegation. In this example here, we could simply add the event handler
to the main element.</p>

<p>All right, so again, event delegation is to not set up the event handler on the original element that we're interested in but to attach it to a parent element and, basically, catch the event there because it bubbles up. We can then act on the element that we're interested in using the target element property.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong>
Now lets assume we have two list item in our page, after adding items in those list programmtically we want to delete one or more items from them. Using event delegation tecnique we can achive our ppurpose easily.</p>

<p>It's basically how association is made to the element. <code>.click</code> applies to the current DOM, while <code>.on</code> (using delegation) will continue to be valid for new elements added to the DOM after event association.</p>

<p>Which is better to use, I'd say it depends on the case.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;ul id=<span class="hljs-string">"todo"</span>&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span>Do 1<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span></span>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span>Do 2<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span></span>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span>Do 3<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span></span>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span>Do 4<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span></span>
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>.Click Event:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$(<span class="hljs-string">"li"</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">click</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
&nbsp;&nbsp; $(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>).<span class="hljs-property">remove</span> ();
});
</code></pre>

<p>Event .on:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$(<span class="hljs-string">"#todo"</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">on</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"click"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"li"</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
&nbsp;&nbsp; $(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">remove</span>();
});
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I've separated the selector in the .on. I'll explain why.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that after this association, let us do the following:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$(<span class="hljs-string">"#todo"</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">append</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"&lt;li&gt;Do 5&lt;/li&gt;"</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>That is where you will notice the difference.</p>

<p>If the event was associated via .click, task 5 will not obey the click event, and so it will not be removed.</p>

<p>If it was associated via .on, with the selector separate, it will obey.</p>

<p>A delegate in C# is similar to a function pointer in C or C++. Using a delegate allows the programmer to encapsulate a reference to a method inside a delegate object. The delegate object can then be passed to code which can call the referenced method, without having to know at compile time which method will be invoked. </p>

<p>Event delegation makes use of two often overlooked features of JavaScript events: event bubbling and the target element.When an event is triggered on an element, for example a mouse click on a button, the same event is also triggered on all of that elements ancestors. This process is known as event bubbling; the event bubbles up from the originating element to the top of the DOM tree.</p>

<p>Imagine an HTML table with 10 columns and 100 rows in which you want something to happen when the user clicks on a table cell. For example, I once had to make each cell of a table of that size editable when clicked. Adding event handlers to each of the 1000 cells would be a major performance problem and, potentially, a source of browser-crashing memory leaks. Instead, using event delegation, you would add only one event handler to the table element, intercept the click event and determine which cell was clicked.</p>

<b>Event Delegation</b>

<p>Attach an event listener to a parent element that fires when an event occurs on a child element.</p>

<b>Event Propagation</b>

<p>When an event moves through the DOM from child to a parent element, that's called <i>Event Propagation</i>, because the event propagates, or moves through the DOM.</p>

<p>In this example, an event (onclick) from a button gets passed to the parent paragraph.</p>

Just add the new \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;\u0026amp;lt;li\u0026amp;gt;\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to the list and you\u0026apos;re done.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This is absolutely fantastic for web apps with event handlers bound to many elements, where new elements are dynamically created and/or removed in the DOM. With event delegation the number of event bindings can be drastically decreased by moving them to a common parent element, and code that dynamically creates new elements on the fly can be decoupled from the logic of binding their event handlers.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Another benefit to event delegation is that the total memory footprint used by event listeners goes down (since the number of event bindings go down). It may not make much of a difference to small pages that unload often (i.e. user\u0026apos;s navigate to different pages often). But for long-lived applications it can be significant. There are some really difficult-to-track-down situations when elements removed from the DOM still claim memory (i.e. they leak), and often this leaked memory is tied to an event binding. With event delegation you\u0026apos;re free to destroy child elements without risk of forgetting to \u0026quot;unbind\u0026quot; their event listeners (since the listener is on the ancestor). These types of memory leaks can then be contained (if not eliminated, which is freaking hard to do sometimes. IE I\u0026apos;m looking at you).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Here are some better concrete code examples of event delegation:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;How JavaScript Event Delegation Works\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20090415060836/http://icant.co.uk/sandbox/eventdelegation/\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Event Delegation versus Event Handling\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://api.jquery.com/delegate/\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;jQuery.delegate\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; is event delegation + selector specification\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;jQuery.on\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; uses event delegation when passed a selector as the 2nd parameter\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20090420170842/http://usabletype.com/weblog/event-delegation-without-javascript-library/\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot; title=\u0026quot;http://usabletype.com/weblog/event-delegation-without-javascript-library/\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Event delegation without a JavaScript library\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://lists.evolt.org/archive/Week-of-Mon-20090209/127339.html\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Closures vs Event delegation\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;: takes a look at the pros of \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;not\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; converting code to use event delegation\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Interesting approach PPK uncovered for \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2008/04/delegating_the.html\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;delegating the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;focus\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;blur\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; events\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; (which do \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;not\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; bubble)\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Event delegation allows you to avoid adding event listeners to specific nodes;  instead, the event listener is added to one parent.

You could add a separate event listener to each individual LI element, but what if LI elements are frequently added and removed from the list?  Adding and removing event listeners would be a nightmare, especially if addition and removal code is in different places within your app.  The better solution is to add an event listener to the parent UL element.  But if you add the event listener to the parent, how will you know which element was clicked?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Simple:  when the event bubbles up to the UL element, you check the event object\u0026apos;s target property to gain a reference to the actual clicked node.

Let\u0026apos;s have a parent DIV with many children but all we care about is an A tag with the classA CSS class:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-js s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-comment\u0026quot;\u0026gt;// Get the parent DIV, add click listener...\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-variable language_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;document\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;getElementById\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;myDiv\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;).\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;addEventListener\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;click\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;function\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-params\u0026quot;\u0026gt;e\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;) {\n\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-comment\u0026quot;\u0026gt;// e.target was the clicked element\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n  \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;if\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(e.\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-property\u0026quot;\u0026gt;target\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026amp;amp;\u0026amp;amp; e.\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-property\u0026quot;\u0026gt;target\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-property\u0026quot;\u0026gt;nodeName\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; == \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;A\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;) {\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-comment\u0026quot;\u0026gt;// Get the CSS classes\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;var\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; classes = e.\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-property\u0026quot;\u0026gt;target\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-property\u0026quot;\u0026gt;className\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;split\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot; \u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;);\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-comment\u0026quot;\u0026gt;// Search for the CSS class!\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;if\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(classes) {\n        \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-comment\u0026quot;\u0026gt;// For every CSS class the element has...\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n        \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;for\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;var\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; x = \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-number\u0026quot;\u0026gt;0\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;; x \u0026amp;lt; classes.\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-property\u0026quot;\u0026gt;length\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;; x++) {\n            \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-comment\u0026quot;\u0026gt;// If it has the CSS class we want...\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n            \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;if\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(classes[x] == \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;classA\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;) {\n                \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-comment\u0026quot;\u0026gt;// Bingo!\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n                \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-variable language_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;console\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;log\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;Anchor element clicked!\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;);\n                \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-comment\u0026quot;\u0026gt;// Now do something here....\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n  }\n});\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;http://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;dom event delegation\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; is something different from the computer science definition.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;It refers to handling bubbling events from many elements, like table cells, from a parent object, like the table. It can keep the code simpler, especially when adding or removing elements, and saves some memory.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Event delegation is handling an event that \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;bubbles\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; using an event handler on a container element, but only activating the event handler\u0026apos;s behavior if the event happened on an element within the container that matches a given condition. This can simplify handling events on elements within the container.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;For instance, suppose you want to handle a click on any table cell in a big table. You \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;could\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; write a loop to hook up a click handler to each cell...or you could hook up a click handler on the table and use event delegation to trigger it only for table cells (and not table headers, or the whitespace within a row around cells, etc.).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;It\u0026apos;s also useful when you\u0026apos;re going to be adding and removing elements from the container, because you don\u0026apos;t have to worry about adding and removing event handlers on those elements; just hook the event on the container and handle the event when it bubbles.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Here\u0026apos;s a simple example (it\u0026apos;s intentionally verbose to allow for inline explanation): Handling a click on any \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;td\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;

rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Delegation\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; is a technique where an object expresses certain behavior to the outside but in reality delegates responsibility for implementing that behaviour to an associated object. This sounds at first very similar to the proxy pattern, but it serves a much different purpose. Delegation is an abstraction mechanism which centralizes object (method) behavior.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Generally spoken: use delegation as alternative to inheritance. Inheritance is a good strategy, when a close relationship exist in between parent and child object, however, inheritance couples objects very closely. Often, delegation is the more flexible way to express a relationship between classes.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This pattern is also known as \u0026quot;proxy chains\u0026quot;. Several other design patterns use delegation - the State, Strategy and Visitor Patterns depend on it.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;The delegation concept\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If there are many elements inside one parent, and you want to handle events on them of them - dont bind handlers to each element.\nInstead, bind the single handler to their parent, and get the child from event.target.\nThis site provides useful info about how to implement event delegation.\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://javascript.info/tutorial/event-delegation\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;http://javascript.info/tutorial/event-delegation\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;To understand event delegation first we need to know why and when we actually need or want event delegation.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;There may be many cases but let\u0026apos;s discuss two big use cases for event delegation.\n1. The first case is when we have an element with lots of child elements that we are interested in. In this case, instead of adding an event handler to all of these child elements, we simply add it to the parent element and then determine on which child element the event was fired. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;2.The second use case for event delegation is when we want an event handler attached to an element that is not yet in the DOM when our page is loaded. That\u0026apos;s, of course, because we cannot add an event handler to something that\u0026apos;s not on our page, so in a case of deprecation that we\u0026apos;re coding.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Suppose you have a list of 0, 10, or 100 items in the DOM when you load your page, and more items are waiting in your hand to add in the list. So there is no way to attach an event handler for the future elements or those elements are not added in the DOM yet, and also there may be a lot of items, so it wouldn\u0026apos;t be useful to have one event handler attached to each of them.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Event Delegation\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;All right, so in order to talk about event delegation, the first concept that we actually need to talk about is event bubbling.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Event bubbling:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\nEvent bubbling means that when an event is fired or triggered on some DOM element, for example by clicking on our button here on the bellow image, then the exact same event is also triggered on all of the parent elements.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/pcbPG.jpg\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/pcbPG.jpg\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;enter image description here\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The event is first fired on the button, but then it will also be fired on all the parent elements one at a time, so it will also fire on the paragraph to the  section the main element and actually all the way up in a DOM tree until the HTML element which is the root. So we say that the event bubbles up inside the DOM tree, and that\u0026apos;s why it\u0026apos;s called bubbling.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/sCEZA.jpg\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/sCEZA.jpg\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/VNtwk.jpg\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/VNtwk.jpg\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;2\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/0ONWn.jpg\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/0ONWn.jpg\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;3\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/QX0Iy.jpg\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/QX0Iy.jpg\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;4\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Target element:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; The element on which the event was actually first fired called the target element, so the element that caused the event to happen, is called the target element. In our above example here it\u0026apos;s, of course, the button that was clicked. The important part is that this target element is stored as a property in the event object, This means that all the parent elements on which the event will also fire will know the target element of the event, so where the event was first fired.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;That brings us to event delegation\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; because if the event bubbles up in the DOM tree, and if we know where the event was fired then we can simply attach an event handler to a parent element and wait for the event to bubble up, and we can then do whatever we intended to do with our target element. This technique is called event delegation. In this example here, we could simply add the event handler\nto the main element.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;All right, so again, event delegation is to not set up the event handler on the original element that we\u0026apos;re interested in but to attach it to a parent element and, basically, catch the event there because it bubbles up. We can then act on the element that we\u0026apos;re interested in using the target element property.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Example:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\nNow lets assume we have two list item in our page, after adding items in those list programmtically we want to delete one or more items from them. Using event delegation tecnique we can achive our ppurpose easily.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-js s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026amp;lt;div \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;class\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;=\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;body\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026amp;gt;\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;language-xml\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-tag\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026amp;lt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-name\u0026quot;\u0026gt;div\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;

This process is known as event bubbling; the event bubbles up from the originating element to the top of the DOM tree.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Imagine an HTML table with 10 columns and 100 rows in which you want something to happen when the user clicks on a table cell. For example, I once had to make each cell of a table of that size editable when clicked. Adding event handlers to each of the 1000 cells would be a major performance problem and, potentially, a source of browser-crashing memory leaks. Instead, using event delegation, you would add only one event handler to the table element, intercept the click event and determine which cell was clicked.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Event Delegation\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Attach an event listener to a parent element that fires when an event occurs on a child element.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Event Propagation\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When an event moves through the DOM from child to a parent element, that\u0026apos;s called \u0026lt;i\u0026gt;Event Propagation\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;, because the event propagates, or moves through the DOM.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In this example, an event (onclick) from a button gets passed to the parent paragraph.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;snippet\u0026quot;
