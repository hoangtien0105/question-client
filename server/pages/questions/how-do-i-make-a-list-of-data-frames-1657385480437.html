Having sequentially named data frames is a problem, and putting them in a list is a good fix, but best practice is to avoid having a bunch of data.frames not in a list in the first place.\n\nThe other answers give plenty of detail of how to assign data frames to list elements, access them, etc. We&apos;ll cover that a little here too, but the Main Point is to say don&apos;t wait until you have a bunch of a data.frames to add them to a list. Start with the list.\n\nThe rest of the this answer will cover some common cases where you might be tempted to create sequential variables, and show you how to go straight to lists. If you&apos;re new to lists in R, you might want to also read What&apos;s the difference between [[ and [ in accessing elements of a list?.\n\n\n\nLists from the start\n\nDon&apos;t ever create d1 d2 d3, ..., dn in the first place. Create a list d with n elements.\n\nReading multiple files into a list of data frames\n\nThis is done pretty easily when reading in files. Maybe you&apos;ve got files data1.csv, data2.csv, ... in a directory. Your goal is a list of data.frames called mydata. The first thing you need is a vector with all the file names. You can construct this with paste (e.g., my_files = paste0(&quot;data&quot;, 1:5, &quot;.csv&quot;)), but it&apos;s probably easier to use list.files to grab all the appropriate files: my_files &lt;- list.files(pattern = &quot;\\\\.csv$&quot;). You can use regular  expressions to match the files, read more about regular expressions in other questions if you need help there. This way you can grab all CSV files even if they don&apos;t follow a nice naming scheme. Or you can use a fancier regex pattern if you need to pick certain CSV files out from a bunch of them.\n\nAt this point, most R beginners will use a for loop, and there&apos;s nothing wrong with that, it works just fine.\n\nmy_data &lt;- list()\nfor (i in seq_along(my_files)) {\n    my_data[[i]] &lt;- read.csv(file = my_files[i])\n}\n\n\nA more R-like way to do it is with lapply, which is a shortcut for the above\n\nmy_data &lt;- lapply(my_files, read.csv)\n\n\nOf course, substitute other data import function for read.csv as appropriate. readr::read_csv or data.table::fread will be faster, or you may also need a different function for a different file type.\n\nEither way, it&apos;s handy to name the list elements to match the files\n\nnames(my_data) &lt;- gsub(&quot;\\\\.csv$&quot;, &quot;&quot;, my_files)\n# or, if you prefer the consistent syntax of stringr\nnames(my_data) &lt;- stringr::str_replace(my_files, pattern = &quot;.csv&quot;, replacement = &quot;&quot;)\n\n\nSplitting a data frame into a list of data frames\n\nThis is super-easy, the base function split() does it for you. You can split by a column (or columns) of the data, or by anything else you want\n\nmt_list = split(mtcars, f = mtcars$cyl)\n# This gives a list of three data frames, one for each value of cyl\n\n\nThis is also a nice way to break a data frame into pieces for cross-validation. Maybe you want to split mtcars into training, test, and validation pieces.\n\ngroups = sample(c(&quot;train&quot;, &quot;test&quot;, &quot;validate&quot;),\n                size = nrow(mtcars), replace = TRUE)\nmt_split = split(mtcars, f = groups)\n# and mt_split has appropriate names already!\n\n\nSimulating a list of data frames\n\nMaybe you&apos;re simulating data, something like this:\n\nmy_sim_data = data.frame(x = rnorm(50), y = rnorm(50))\n\n\nBut who does only one simulation? You want to do this 100 times, 1000 times, more! But you don&apos;t want 10,000 data frames in your workspace. Use replicate and put them in a list:\n\nsim_list = replicate(n = 10,\n                     expr = {data.frame(x = rnorm(50), y = rnorm(50))},\n                     simplify = F)\n\n\nIn this case especially, you should also consider whether you really need separate data frames, or would a single data frame with a &quot;group&quot; column work just as well? Using data.table or dplyr it&apos;s quite easy to do things &quot;by group&quot; to a data frame.\n\nI didn&apos;t put my data in a list :( I will next time, but what can I do now?\n\nIf they&apos;re an odd assortment (which is unusual), you can simply assign them:\n\nmylist &lt;- list()\nmylist[[1]] &lt;- mtcars\nmylist[[2]] &lt;- data.frame(a = rnorm(50), b = runif(50))\n...\n\n\nIf you have data frames named in a pattern, e.g., df1, df2, df3, and you want them in a list, you can get them if you can write a regular expression to match the names. Something like\n\ndf_list = mget(ls(pattern = &quot;df[0-9]&quot;))\n# this would match any object with &quot;df&quot; followed by a digit in its name\n# you can test what objects will be got by just running the\nls(pattern = &quot;df[0-9]&quot;)\n# part and adjusting the pattern until it gets the right objects.\n\n\nGenerally, mget is used to get multiple objects and return them in a named list. Its counterpart get is used to get a single object and return it (not in a list).\n\nCombining a list of data frames into a single data frame\n\nA common task is combining a list of data frames into one big data frame. If you want to stack them on top of each other, you would use rbind for a pair of them, but for a list of data frames here are three good choices:\n\n# base option - slower but not extra dependencies\nbig_data = do.call(what = rbind, args = df_list)\n\n# data table and dplyr have nice functions for this that\n#  - are much faster\n#  - add id columns to identify the source\n#  - fill in missing values if some data frames have more columns than others\n# see their help pages for details\nbig_data = data.table::rbindlist(df_list)\nbig_data = dplyr::bind_rows(df_list)\n\n\n(Similarly using cbind or dplyr::bind_cols for columns.)\n\nTo merge (join) a list of data frames, you can see these answers. Often, the idea is to use Reduce with merge (or some other joining function) to get them together.\n\nWhy put the data in a list?\n\nPut similar data in lists because you want to do similar things to each data frame, and functions like lapply, sapply do.call, the purrr package, and the old plyr l*ply functions make it easy to do that. Examples of people easily doing things with lists are all over SO.\n\nEven if you use a lowly for loop, it&apos;s much easier to loop over the elements of a list than it is to construct variable names with paste and access the objects with get. Easier to debug, too.\n\nThink of scalability. If you really only need three variables, it&apos;s fine to use d1, d2, d3. But then if it turns out you really need 6, that&apos;s a lot more typing. And next time, when you need 10 or 20, you find yourself copying and pasting lines of code, maybe using find/replace to change d14 to d15, and you&apos;re thinking this isn&apos;t how programming should be. If you use a list, the difference between 3 cases, 30 cases, and 300 cases is at most one line of code---no change at all if your number of cases is automatically detected by, e.g., how many .csv files are in your directory. \n\nYou can name the elements of a list, in case you want to use something other than numeric indices to access your data frames (and you can use both, this isn&apos;t an XOR choice).\n\nOverall, using lists will lead you to write cleaner, easier-to-read code, which will result in fewer bugs and less confusion.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"This isn&apos;t related to your question, but you want to use = and not &lt;- within the function call.

<p>The other answers show you <em>how</em> to make a list of data.frames when you <em>already have</em> a bunch of data.frames, e.g., <code>d1</code>, <code>d2</code>, .... Having sequentially named data frames is a problem, and putting them in a list is a good fix, but best practice is to <strong>avoid having a bunch of data.frames not in a list</strong> in the first place.</p>

<p>The other answers give plenty of detail of how to assign data frames to list elements, access them, etc. We'll cover that a little here too, but the <em>Main Point</em> is to say <em>don't wait until you have a bunch of a <code>data.frames</code> to add them to a list. Start with the list.</em></p>

<p>The rest of the this answer will cover some common cases where you might be tempted to create sequential variables, and show you how to go straight to lists. If you're new to lists in R, you might want to also read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/1169456/903061">What's the difference between <code>[[</code> and <code>[</code> in accessing elements of a list?</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Lists from the start</h2>

<p>Don't ever create <code>d1</code> <code>d2</code> <code>d3</code>, ..., <code>dn</code> in the first place. Create a list <code>d</code> with <code>n</code> elements.</p>

<h3>Reading multiple files into a list of data frames</h3>

<p>This is done pretty easily when reading in files. Maybe you've got files <code>data1.csv, data2.csv, ...</code> in a directory. Your goal is a list of data.frames called <code>mydata</code>. The first thing you need is a vector with all the file names. You can construct this with paste (e.g., <code>my_files = paste0("data", 1:5, ".csv")</code>), but it's probably easier to use <code>list.files</code> to grab all the appropriate files: <code>my_files &lt;- list.files(pattern = "\\.csv$")</code>. You can use regular  expressions to match the files, read more about regular expressions in other questions if you need help there. This way you can grab all CSV files even if they don't follow a nice naming scheme. Or you can use a fancier regex pattern if you need to pick certain CSV files out from a bunch of them.</p>

<p>At this point, most R beginners will use a <code>for</code> loop, and there's nothing wrong with that, it works just fine.</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">my_data <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>i <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">seq_along</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>my_files<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">{</span>
    my_data<span class="hljs-punctuation">[[</span>i<span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> read.csv<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>file <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> my_files<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span>i<span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
<span class="hljs-punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>

<p>A more R-like way to do it is with <code>lapply</code>, which is a shortcut for the above</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">my_data <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> lapply<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>my_files<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> read.csv<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, substitute other data import function for <code>read.csv</code> as appropriate. <code>readr::read_csv</code> or <code>data.table::fread</code> will be faster, or you may also need a different function for a different file type.</p>

<p>Either way, it's handy to name the list elements to match the files</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r"><span class="hljs-built_in">names</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>my_data<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span> <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> gsub<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-string">"\\.csv$"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-string">""</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> my_files<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># or, if you prefer the consistent syntax of stringr</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">names</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>my_data<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span> <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> stringr<span class="hljs-operator">::</span>str_replace<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>my_files<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> pattern <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">".csv"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> replacement <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">""</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>

<h3>Splitting a data frame into a list of data frames</h3>

<p>This is super-easy, the base function <code>split()</code> does it for you. You can split by a column (or columns) of the data, or by anything else you want</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">mt_list <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> split<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>mtcars<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> f <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> mtcars<span class="hljs-operator">$</span>cyl<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># This gives a list of three data frames, one for each value of cyl</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This is also a nice way to break a data frame into pieces for cross-validation. Maybe you want to split <code>mtcars</code> into training, test, and validation pieces.</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">groups <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> sample<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-built_in">c</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-string">"train"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-string">"test"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-string">"validate"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span>
                size <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> nrow<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>mtcars<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> replace <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-literal">TRUE</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
mt_split <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> split<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>mtcars<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> f <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> groups<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># and mt_split has appropriate names already!</span>
</code></pre>

<h3>Simulating a list of data frames</h3>

<p>Maybe you're simulating data, something like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">my_sim_data <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> data.frame<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>x <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> rnorm<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-number">50</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> y <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> rnorm<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-number">50</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>But who does only one simulation? You want to do this 100 times, 1000 times, more! But you <em>don't</em> want 10,000 data frames in your workspace. Use <code>replicate</code> and put them in a list:</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">sim_list <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> replicate<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>n <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-number">10</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span>
                     expr <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">{</span>data.frame<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>x <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> rnorm<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-number">50</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> y <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> rnorm<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-number">50</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">}</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span>
                     simplify <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">F</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In this case especially, you should also consider whether you really need separate data frames, or would a single data frame with a "group" column work just as well? Using <code>data.table</code> or <code>dplyr</code> it's quite easy to do things "by group" to a data frame.</p>

<h3>I didn't put my data in a list :( I will next time, but what can I do now?</h3>

<p>If they're an odd assortment (which is unusual), you can simply assign them:</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">mylist <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
mylist<span class="hljs-punctuation">[[</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> mtcars
mylist<span class="hljs-punctuation">[[</span><span class="hljs-number">2</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> data.frame<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>a <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> rnorm<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-number">50</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> b <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> runif<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-number">50</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
...
</code></pre>

<p>If you have data frames named in a pattern, e.g., <code>df1</code>, <code>df2</code>, <code>df3</code>, and you want them in a list, you can <code>get</code> them if you can write a regular expression to match the names. Something like</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">df_list <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> mget<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>ls<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>pattern <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">"df[0-9]"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># this would match any object with "df" followed by a digit in its name</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># you can test what objects will be got by just running the</span>
ls<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>pattern <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">"df[0-9]"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># part and adjusting the pattern until it gets the right objects.</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Generally, <code>mget</code> is used to get multiple objects and return them in a named list. Its counterpart <code>get</code> is used to get a single object and return it (not in a list).</p>

<h3>Combining a list of data frames into a single data frame</h3>

<p>A common task is combining a list of data frames into one big data frame. If you want to stack them on top of each other, you would use <code>rbind</code> for a pair of them, but for a list of data frames here are three good choices:</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r"><span class="hljs-comment"># base option - slower but not extra dependencies</span>
big_data <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> do.call<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>what <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> rbind<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> args <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> df_list<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>

<span class="hljs-comment"># data table and dplyr have nice functions for this that</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">#  - are much faster</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">#  - add id columns to identify the source</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">#  - fill in missing values if some data frames have more columns than others</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># see their help pages for details</span>
big_data <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> data.table<span class="hljs-operator">::</span>rbindlist<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>df_list<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
big_data <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> dplyr<span class="hljs-operator">::</span>bind_rows<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>df_list<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>(Similarly using <code>cbind</code> or <code>dplyr::bind_cols</code> for columns.)</p>

<p>To merge (join) a list of data frames, you can see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/8091303/903061">these answers</a>. Often, the idea is to use <code>Reduce</code> with <code>merge</code> (or some other joining function) to get them together.</p>

<h2>Why put the data in a list?</h2>

<p>Put similar data in lists because you want to do similar things to each data frame, and functions like <code>lapply</code>, <code>sapply</code> <code>do.call</code>, <a href="https://github.com/hadley/purrr" rel="noreferrer">the <code>purrr</code> package</a>, and the old <code>plyr</code> <code>l*ply</code> functions make it easy to do that. Examples of people easily doing things with lists are all over SO.</p>

<p>Even if you use a lowly for loop, it's much easier to loop over the elements of a list than it is to construct variable names with <code>paste</code> and access the objects with <code>get</code>. Easier to debug, too.</p>

<p>Think of <strong>scalability</strong>. If you really only need three variables, it's fine to use <code>d1</code>, <code>d2</code>, <code>d3</code>. But then if it turns out you really need 6, that's a lot more typing. And next time, when you need 10 or 20, you find yourself copying and pasting lines of code, maybe using find/replace to change <code>d14</code> to <code>d15</code>, and you're thinking <em>this isn't how programming should be</em>. If you use a list, the difference between 3 cases, 30 cases, and 300 cases is at most one line of code---no change at all if your number of cases is automatically detected by, e.g., how many <code>.csv</code> files are in your directory. </p>

<p>You can name the elements of a list, in case you want to use something other than numeric indices to access your data frames (and you can use both, this isn't an XOR choice).</p>

<p>Overall, using lists will lead you to write cleaner, easier-to-read code, which will result in fewer bugs and less confusion.</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">d1 <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> data.frame<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>y1 <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">3</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> y2 <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-number">4</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">5</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">6</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
y1
<span class="hljs-comment"># [1] 1 2 3</span>
y2
<span class="hljs-comment"># [1] 4 5 6</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This won't have the seemingly desired effect of creating column names in the data frame:</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">d1
<span class="hljs-comment">#   y1....c.1..2..3. y2....c.4..5..6.</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># 1                1                4</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># 2                2                5</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># 3                3                6</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>=</code> operator, on the other hand, will associate your vectors with arguments to <code>data.frame</code>.</p>

<p>As for your question, making a list of data frames is easy:</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">d1 <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> data.frame<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>y1 <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">3</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> y2 <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-number">4</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">5</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">6</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>

</code></pre>

<p>You access the data frames just like you would access any other list element:</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">my.list<span class="hljs-punctuation">[[</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">#   y1 y2</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># 1  1  4</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># 2  2  5</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># 3  3  6</span>
</code></pre>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution3" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl solution-inner border md:px-10 md:py-10 px-2 py-10 shadow-md bg-white"><div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-between"><h4 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 3</h4><div class="tags-wrap h-max space-x-8"><div class="tags"></div></div></div><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>You can also access specific columns and values in each list element with  <code>[</code> and <code>[[</code>. Here are a couple of examples.   First, we can access only the first column of each data frame in the list with <code>lapply(ldf, "[", 1)</code>, where <code>1</code> signifies the column number.</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">ldf <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>d1 <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> d1<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> d2 <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> d2<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>  <span class="hljs-comment">## create a named list of your data frames</span>

<span class="hljs-comment"># $d1</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">#   y1</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># 1  1</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># 2  2</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># 3  3</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">#</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># $d2</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">#   y1</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># 1  3</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># 2  2</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># 3  1</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, we can access the first value in the second column with</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">lapply<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>ldf<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-string">"["</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># $d1</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># [1] 4</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># </span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># $d2</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># [1] 6</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Then we can also access the column values directly, as a vector, with <code>[[</code></p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">lapply<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>ldf<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-string">"[["</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>

<span class="hljs-comment"># [1] 1 2 3</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">#</span>

<span class="hljs-comment"># [1] 3 2 1</span>

<p>Taking as a given you have a "large" number of data.frames with similar names (here d# where # is some positive integer), the following is a slight improvement of @mark-miller's method. It is more terse and returns a <em>named</em> list of data.frames, where each name in the list is the name of the corresponding original data.frame.</p>

<p>The key is using <code>mget</code> together with <code>ls</code>. If the data frames d1 and d2 provided in the question were the only objects with names d# in the environment, then</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">my.list <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> mget<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>ls<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>pattern<span class="hljs-operator">=</span><span class="hljs-string">"^d[0-9]+"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>which would return</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">my.list

<span class="hljs-number">3</span>  <span class="hljs-number">1</span>  <span class="hljs-number">4</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This method takes advantage of the pattern argument in <code>ls</code>, which allows us to use regular expressions to do a finer parsing of the names of objects in the environment. An alternative to the regex <code>"^d[0-9]+$"</code> is <code>"^d\\d+$"</code>.</p>

<p>As @gregor <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/24376207/4895725">points out</a>, it is a better overall to set up your data construction process so that the data.frames are put into named lists at the start.</p>

<h3 id="accessing-the-data-b1t4">Accessing the data</h3>
<p>Then to get the <code>n</code>th dataframe from the list we use <code>dat_list[[n]]</code>. You can access the data within this dataframe in the normal way, e.g. <code>dat_list[[2]]$x</code>.</p>
<p>Or if you want the same part from all your dataframes <code>sapply(dat_list, "[", "x")</code>.</p>

<p>I consider myself a complete newbie, but I think I have an extremely simple answer to one of the original subquestions that has not been stated here: accessing the data frames, or parts of it.</p>
<p>Let's start by creating the list with data frames as was stated above:</p>
<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">d1 <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> data.frame<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>y1 <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">3</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> y2 <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-number">4</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">5</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">6</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>

d2 <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> data.frame<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>y1 <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-number">3</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> y2 <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-number">6</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">5</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">4</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>

my.list <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>d1<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> d2<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Then, if you want to access a specific value in one of the data frames, you can do so by using the double brackets sequentially. The first set gets you into the data frame, and the second set gets you to the specific coordinates:</p>
<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">my.list<span class="hljs-punctuation">[[</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span><span class="hljs-number">3</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span>

<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-number">6</span>
</code></pre>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution8" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl solution-inner border md:px-10 md:py-10 px-2 py-10 shadow-md bg-white"><div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-between"><h4 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 8</h4><div class="tags-wrap h-max space-x-8"><div class="tags"></div></div></div><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>This may be a little late but going back to your example I thought I would extend the answer just a tad.  </p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r"> D1 <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> data.frame<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>Y1<span class="hljs-operator">=</span><span class="hljs-built_in">c</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span><span class="hljs-number">2</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span><span class="hljs-number">3</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> Y2<span class="hljs-operator">=</span><span class="hljs-built_in">c</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-number">4</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span><span class="hljs-number">5</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span><span class="hljs-number">6</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>

</code></pre>

<p>Then you make your list easily:</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">mylist <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>D1<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span>D2<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span>D3<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span>D4<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have a list but instead of accessing the list the old way such as  </p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">mylist<span class="hljs-punctuation">[[</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-comment"># to access 'd1'</span>
</code></pre>

<p>you can use this function to obtain &amp; assign the dataframe of your choice.</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">GETDF_FROMLIST <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>DF_LIST<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> ITEM_LOC<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">{</span>

   <span class="hljs-built_in">return</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>DF_SELECTED<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
<span class="hljs-punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Now get the one you want.</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">D1 <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> GETDF_FROMLIST<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>mylist<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>

<p>Very simple ! Here is my suggestion : </p>

<p><strong>If you want to select dataframes in your workspace, try this :</strong> </p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">Filter<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>x<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span> is.data.frame<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>get<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>x<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> ls<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>or </p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">ls<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span>sapply<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>ls<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>x<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span> is.data.frame<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>get<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>x<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>all these will give the same result. </p>

<p>You can change <code>is.data.frame</code> to check other types of variables like <code>is.function</code></p>

Maybe you\u0026apos;ve got files \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;data1.csv, data2.csv, ...\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; in a directory. Your goal is a list of data.frames called \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;mydata\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. The first thing you need is a vector with all the file names. You can construct this with paste (e.g., \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;my_files = paste0(\u0026quot;data\u0026quot;, 1:5, \u0026quot;.csv\u0026quot;)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;), but it\u0026apos;s probably easier to use \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;list.files\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to grab all the appropriate files: \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;my_files \u0026amp;lt;- list.files(pattern = \u0026quot;\\\\.csv$\u0026quot;)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. You can use regular  expressions to match the files, read more about regular expressions in other questions if you need help there. This way you can grab all CSV files even if they don\u0026apos;t follow a nice naming scheme. Or you can use a fancier regex pattern if you need to pick certain CSV files out from a bunch of them.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;At this point, most R beginners will use a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;for\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; loop, and there\u0026apos;s nothing wrong with that, it works just fine.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-r s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-r\u0026quot;\u0026gt;my_data \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-operator\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026amp;lt;-\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;
