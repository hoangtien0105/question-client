Sequential for loop:\n\n\nvar myStringArray = [&quot;Hello&quot;,&quot;World&quot;];\nvar arrayLength = myStringArray.length;\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; arrayLength; i++) {\n    console.log(myStringArray[i]);\n    //Do something\n}\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\nPros\n\nWorks on every environment\nYou can use break and continue flow control statements\n\nCons\n\nToo verbose\nImperative\nEasy to have off-by-one errors (sometimes also called a fence post error)\n\n2. Array.prototype.forEach:\nThe ES5 specification introduced a lot of beneficial array methods. One of them, the Array.prototype.forEach, gave us a concise way to iterate over an array:\n\n\nconst array = [&quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, &quot;three&quot;]\narray.forEach(function (item, index) {\n  console.log(item, index);\n});\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\nBeing almost ten years as the time of writing that the ES5 specification was released (Dec. 2009), it has been implemented by nearly all modern engines in the desktop, server, and mobile environments, so it&apos;s safe to use them.\nAnd with the ES6 arrow function syntax, it&apos;s even more succinct:\narray.forEach(item =&gt; console.log(item));\n\nArrow functions are also widely implemented unless you plan to support ancient platforms (e.g., Internet Explorer 11); you are also safe to go.\nPros\n\nVery short and succinct.\nDeclarative\n\nCons\n\nCannot use break / continue\n\nNormally, you can replace the need to break out of imperative loops by filtering the array elements before iterating them, for example:\narray.filter(item =&gt; item.condition &lt; 10)\n     .forEach(item =&gt; console.log(item))\n\nKeep in mind if you are iterating an array to build another array from it, you should use map. I&apos;ve seen this anti-pattern so many times.\nAnti-pattern:\nconst numbers = [1,2,3,4,5], doubled = [];\n\nnumbers.forEach((n, i) =&gt; { doubled[i] = n * 2 });\n\nProper use case of map:\n\n\nconst numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];\nconst doubled = numbers.map(n =&gt; n * 2);\n\nconsole.log(doubled);\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\nAlso, if you are trying to reduce the array to a value, for example, you want to sum an array of numbers, you should use the reduce method.\nAnti-pattern:\nconst numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];\nconst sum = 0;\nnumbers.forEach(num =&gt; { sum += num });\n\nProper use of reduce:\n\n\nconst numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];\nconst sum = numbers.reduce((total, n) =&gt; total + n, 0);\n\nconsole.log(sum);\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n3. ES6 for-of statement:\nThe ES6 standard introduces the concept of iterable objects and defines a new construct for traversing data, the for...of statement.\nThis statement works for any kind of iterable object and also for generators (any object that has a \\[Symbol.iterator\\] property).\nArray objects are by definition built-in iterables in ES6, so you can use this statement on them:\nlet colors = [&apos;red&apos;, &apos;green&apos;, &apos;blue&apos;];\nfor (const color of colors){\n    console.log(color);\n}\n\nPros\n\nIt can iterate over a large variety of objects.\nCan use normal flow control statements (break / continue).\nUseful to iterate serially asynchronous values.\n\nCons\n\nIf you are targeting older browsers, the transpiled output might surprise you.\n\nDo not use for...in\n@zipcodeman suggests the use of the for...in statement, but for iterating arrays for-in should be avoided, that statement is meant to enumerate object properties.\nIt shouldn&apos;t be used for array-like objects because:\n\nThe order of iteration is not guaranteed; the array indexes may not be visited in numeric order.\nInherited properties are also enumerated.\n\nThe second point is that it can give you a lot of problems, for example, if you extend the Array.prototype object to include a method there, that property will also be enumerated.\nFor example:\n\n\nArray.prototype.foo = &quot;foo!&quot;;\nvar array = [&apos;a&apos;, &apos;b&apos;, &apos;c&apos;];\n\nfor (var i in array) {\n    console.log(array[i]);\n}\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\nThe above code will console log &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;foo!&quot;.\nThat can be particularly a problem if you use some library that relies heavily on native prototypes augmentation (such as MooTools).\nThe for-in statement, as I said before, is there to enumerate object properties, for example:\n\n\nvar obj = {\n    &quot;a&quot;: 1,\n    &quot;b&quot;: 2,\n    &quot;c&quot;: 3\n};\n\nfor (var prop in obj) {\n    if (obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {\n        // or if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj,prop)) for safety...\n        console.log(&quot;prop: &quot; + prop + &quot; value: &quot; + obj[prop])\n    }\n}\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\nIn the above example, the hasOwnProperty method allows you to enumerate only own properties. That&apos;s it, only the properties that the object physically has, no inherited properties.\nI would recommend you to read the following article:\n\nEnumeration VS Iteration\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Yes, assuming your implementation includes the for...of feature introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (the &quot;Harmony&quot; release)... which is a pretty safe assumption these days.\n\nIt works like this:\n\n// REQUIRES ECMASCRIPT 2015+\nvar s, myStringArray = [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;];\nfor (s of myStringArray) {\n  // ... do something with s ...\n}\n\n\nOr better yet, since ECMAScript 2015 also provides block-scoped variables:\n\n// REQUIRES ECMASCRIPT 2015+\nconst myStringArray = [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;];\nfor (const s of myStringArray) {\n  // ... do something with s ...\n}\n// s is no longer defined here\n\n\n(The variable s is different on each iteration, but can still be declared const inside the loop body as long as it isn&apos;t modified there.)\n\nA note on sparse arrays: an array in JavaScript may not actually store as many items as reported by its length; that reported number is simply one greater than the highest index at which a value is stored. If the array holds fewer elements than indicated by its length, its said to be sparse. For example, it&apos;s perfectly legitimate to have an array with items only at indexes 3, 12, and 247; the length of such an array is reported as 248, though it is only actually storing 3 values.  If you try to access an item at any other index, the array will appear to have the undefined value there. So when you want to &quot;loop through&quot; an array, you have a question to answer: do you want to loop over the full range indicated by its length and process undefineds for any missing elements, or do you only want to process the elements actually present? There are plenty of applications for both approaches; it just depends on what you&apos;re using the array for.\n\nIf you iterate over an array with for..of, the body of the loop is executed length times, and the loop control variable is set to undefined for any items not actually present in the array. Depending on the details of your &quot;do something with&quot; code, that behavior may be what you want, but if not, you should use a different approach.\n\nOf course, some developers have no choice but to use a different approach anyway, because for whatever reason they&apos;re targeting a version of JavaScript that doesn&apos;t yet support for...of.\n\nAs long as your JavaScript implementation is compliant with the previous edition of the ECMAScript specification (which rules out, for example, versions of Internet Explorer before 9), then you can use the Array#forEach iterator method instead of a loop. In that case, you pass a function to be called on each item in the array:\n\nvar myStringArray = [ &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot; ];\nmyStringArray.forEach( function(s) { \n     // ... do something with s ...\n} );\n\n\nUnlike for...of, .forEach only calls the function for elements that are actually present in the array. If passed our hypothetical array with three elements and a length of 248, it will only call the function three times, not 248 times. It also distinguishes between missing elements and elements that are actually set to undefined; for the latter, it will still call the function, passing undefined as the argument. If this is how you want to handle sparse arrays, .forEach may be the way to go even if your interpreter supports for...of.\n\nThe final option, which works in all versions of JavaScript, is an explicit counting loop. You simply count from 0 up to one less than the length and use the counter as an index. The basic loop looks like this:\n\nvar i, s, myStringArray = [ &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot; ], len = myStringArray.length;\nfor (i=0; i&lt;len; ++i) {\n  s = myStringArray[i];\n  // ... do something with s ...\n}\n\n\nOne advantage of this approach is that you can choose how to handle sparse arrays; the above code will run the body of the loop the full length times, with s set to undefined for any missing elements, just like for..of. If you instead want to handle only the actually-present elements of a sparse array, like .forEach, you can add a simple in test on the index:\n\nvar i, s, myStringArray = [ &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot; ], len = myStringArray.length;\nfor (i=0; i&lt;len; ++i) {\n  if (i in myStringArray) {\n    s = myStringArray[i];\n    // ... do something with s ...\n  }\n}\n\n\nAssigning the length value to the local variable (as opposed to including the full myStringArray.length expression in the loop condition) can make a significant difference in performance since it skips a property lookup each time through; using Rhino on my machine, the speedup is 43%. \n\nYou may see the length caching done in the loop initialization clause, like this:\n\nvar i, len, myStringArray = [ &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot; ];\nfor (len = myStringArray.length, i=0; i&lt;len; ++i) {\n\n\nThe explicit counting loop also means you have access to the index of each value, should you want it. The index is also passed as an extra parameter to the function you pass to forEach, so you can access it that way as well:\n\nmyStringArray.forEach( function(s, i) {\n   // ... do something with s and i ...\n});\n\n\nfor...of doesn&apos;t give you the index associated with each object, but as long as the object you&apos;re iterating over is actually an Array (for..of works for other iterable types which may not have this method), you can use the Array#entries method to change it to an array of [index, item] pairs, and then iterate over that:\n\nfor (const [i, s] of myStringArray.entries()) {\n  // ... do something with s and i ...\n}\n\n\nThe for...in syntax mentioned by others is for looping over an object&apos;s properties; since an Array in JavaScript is just an object with numeric property names (and an automatically-updated length property), you can theoretically loop over an Array with it.  But the problem is that it doesn&apos;t restrict itself to the numeric property values (remember that even methods are actually just properties whose value is a closure), nor is it guaranteed to iterate over those in numeric order. Therefore, the for...in syntax should not be used for looping through Arrays. \n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You can use map, which is a functional programming technique that&apos;s also available in other languages like Python and Haskell.\n\n[1,2,3,4].map( function(item) {\n     alert(item);\n})\n\n\nThe general syntax is:\n\narray.map(func)\n\n\nIn general func would take one parameter, which is an item of the array.

Such concepts include procedures / functions, IF-statements, FOR-loops, and WHILE-loops.\n\nA traditional for-loop\nA traditional for loop has three components:\n\nThe initialization: executed before the look block is executed the first time\nThe condition: checks a condition every time before the loop block is executed, and quits the loop if false\nThe afterthought: performed every time after the loop block is executed\n\nThese three components are separated from each other by a ; symbol. Content for each of these three components is optional, which means that the following is the most minimal for loop possible:\nfor (;;) {\n    // Do stuff\n}\n\nOf course, you will need to include an if(condition === true) { break; }  or an if(condition === true) { return; } somewhere inside that for-loop to get it to stop running.\nUsually, though, the initialization is used to declare an index, the condition is used to compare that index with a minimum or maximum value, and the afterthought is used to increment the index:\nfor (var i = 0, length = 10; i &lt; length; i++) {\n    console.log(i);\n}\n\n\nUsing a traditional for loop to loop through an array\nThe traditional way to loop through an array, is this:\nfor (var i = 0, length = myArray.length; i &lt; length; i++) {\n    console.log(myArray[i]);\n}\n\nOr, if you prefer to loop backwards, you do this:\nfor (var i = myArray.length - 1; i &gt; -1; i--) {\n    console.log(myArray[i]);\n}\n\nThere are, however, many variations possible, like for example this one:\nfor (var key = 0, value = myArray[key], length = myArray.length; key &lt; length; value = myArray[++key]) {\n    console.log(value);\n}\n\n...or this one...\nvar i = 0, length = myArray.length;\nfor (; i &lt; length;) {\n    console.log(myArray[i]);\n    i++;\n}\n\n...or this one:\nvar key = 0, value;\nfor (; value = myArray[key++];){\n    console.log(value);\n}\n\nWhichever works best is largely a matter of both personal taste and the specific use case you&apos;re implementing.\nNote that each of these variations is supported by all browsers, including very very old ones!\n\nA while loop\nOne alternative to a for loop is a while loop. To loop through an array, you could do this:\nvar key = 0;\nwhile(value = myArray[key++]){\n    console.log(value);\n}\n\nLike traditional for loops, while loops are supported by even the oldest of browsers.\nAlso, note that every while loop can be rewritten as a for loop.

Meaning that there actually is a value at each index in the array. However, I found that in practice I hardly ever use sparse arrays in JavaScript... In such cases it&apos;s usually a lot easier to use an object as a map/hashtable. If you do have a sparse array, and want to loop over 0 .. length-1, you need the for (var i=0; i&lt;someArray.length; ++i) construct, but you still need an if inside the loop to check whether the element at the current index is actually defined.\n\nAlso, as CMS mentions in a comment below, you can only use this on arrays that don&apos;t contain any falsish values. The array of strings from the example works, but if you have empty strings, or numbers that are 0 or NaN, etc. the loop will break off prematurely. Again in practice this is hardly ever a problem for me, but it is something to keep in mind, which makes this a loop to think about before you use it... That may disqualify it for some people :)\n\nWhat I like about this loop is:\n\n\nIt&apos;s short to write\nNo need to access (let alone cache) the length property\nThe item to access is automatically defined within the loop\nbody under the name you pick.\nCombines very naturally with array.push and array.splice to use arrays like lists/stacks\n\n\nThe reason this works is that the array specification mandates that when you read an item from an index &gt;= the array&apos;s length, it will return undefined. When you write to such a location it will actually update the length.\n\nFor me, this construct most closely emulates the Java 5 syntax that I love:\n\nfor (String item : someArray) {\n}\n\n\n... with the added benefit of also knowing about the current index inside the loop\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution18","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"If you&apos;re using the jQuery library, consider using \nhttp://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/\n\nFrom the documentation:\n\n\n  jQuery.each( collection, callback(indexInArray, valueOfElement) ) \n  \n  Returns: Object\n  \n  Description: A generic iterator function, which can be used to\n  seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays.

To make it available, it is certainly the safest way to iterate over an array in JavaScript.\n\nArray.prototype.forEach()\n\nSo as others has suggested, this is almost always what you want:\n\nvar numbers = [1,11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99,111];\nvar sum = 0;\nnumbers.forEach(function(n){\n  sum += n;\n});\n\n\nThis ensures that anything you need in the scope of processing the array stays within that scope, and that you are only processing the values of the array, not the object properties and other members, which is what for .. in does.\n\nUsing a regular C-style for loop works in most cases. It is just important to remember that everything within the loop shares its scope with the rest of your program, the { } does not create a new scope.\n\nHence:\n\nvar sum = 0;\nvar numbers = [1,11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99,111];\n\nfor(var i = 0; i&lt;numbers.length; ++i){\n  sum += numbers[i];\n}\n\nalert(i);\n\n\nwill output &quot;11&quot; - which may or may not be what you want.\n\nA

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#5th_Edition" rel="noreferrer">ES5</a> specification introduced a lot of beneficial array methods. One of them, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach" rel="noreferrer"><code>Array.prototype.forEach</code></a>, gave us a concise way to iterate over an array:</p>

<p></p>
<p>Being almost ten years as the time of writing that the ES5 specification was released (Dec. 2009), it has been implemented by nearly all modern engines in the desktop, server, and mobile environments, so it's safe to use them.</p>
<p>And with the ES6 arrow function syntax, it's even more succinct:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">array.<span class="hljs-title function_">forEach</span>(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">item</span> =&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(item));
</code></pre>
<p>Arrow functions are also widely implemented unless you plan to support ancient platforms (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_11#Internet_Explorer_11" rel="noreferrer">Internet&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;11</a>); you are also safe to go.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Very short and succinct.</li>
<li>Declarative</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cannot use <code>break</code> / <code>continue</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Normally, you can replace the need to <code>break</code> out of imperative loops by filtering the array elements before iterating them, for example:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">array.<span class="hljs-title function_">filter</span>(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">item</span> =&gt;</span> item.<span class="hljs-property">condition</span> &lt; <span class="hljs-number">10</span>)
     .<span class="hljs-title function_">forEach</span>(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">item</span> =&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(item))
</code></pre>
<p>Keep in mind if you are iterating an array <em>to build another array from it</em>, you should use <code>map</code>. I've seen this anti-pattern so many times.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-pattern:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> numbers = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>,<span class="hljs-number">4</span>,<span class="hljs-number">5</span>], doubled = [];

numbers.<span class="hljs-title function_">forEach</span>(<span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">n, i</span>) =&gt;</span> { doubled[i] = n * <span class="hljs-number">2</span> });
</code></pre>

</div>
<p></p>
<p>Also, if you are trying to <em>reduce</em> the array to a value, for example, you want to sum an array of numbers, you should use the <em>reduce</em> method.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-pattern:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> numbers = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>,<span class="hljs-number">4</span>,<span class="hljs-number">5</span>];

<h1>3. ES6 <code>for-of</code> statement:</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#6th_Edition_%E2%80%93_ECMAScript_2015" rel="noreferrer">ES6</a> standard introduces the concept of iterable objects and defines a new construct for traversing data, the <code>for...of</code> statement.</p>
<p>This statement works for any kind of iterable object and also for generators (any object that has a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/iterator" rel="noreferrer"><code>\[Symbol.iterator\]</code></a> property).</p>
<p>Array objects are by definition built-in iterables in ES6, so you can use this statement on them:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> colors = [<span class="hljs-string">'red'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'green'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'blue'</span>];
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> color <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> colors){
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(color);
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It can iterate over a large variety of objects.</li>
<li>Can use normal flow control statements (<code>break</code> / <code>continue</code>).</li>
<li>Useful to iterate serially asynchronous values.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are targeting older browsers, the transpiled output <a href="https://babeljs.io/repl#?babili=false&amp;browsers=&amp;build=&amp;builtIns=false&amp;spec=false&amp;loose=false&amp;code_lz=GYewTgBAFAxiB2BnALhOAbcETDSTYiAlAN4BQEeS-ApgHSYDms-4RA3GQL5A&amp;debug=false&amp;forceAllTransforms=false&amp;shippedProposals=false&amp;circleciRepo=&amp;evaluate=true&amp;fileSize=false&amp;timeTravel=false&amp;sourceType=module&amp;lineWrap=false&amp;presets=es2015&amp;prettier=false&amp;targets=&amp;version=7.4.4&amp;externalPlugins=" rel="noreferrer">might surprise you</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Do not use <code>for...in</code></h1>
<p>@zipcodeman suggests the use of the <code>for...in</code> statement, but for iterating arrays <code>for-in</code> should be avoided, that statement is meant to <strong>enumerate</strong> object properties.</p>
<p>It shouldn't be used for array-like objects because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The order of iteration is not guaranteed; the array indexes may not be visited in numeric order.</li>
<li>Inherited properties are also enumerated.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second point is that it can give you a lot of problems, for example, if you extend the <code>Array.prototype</code> object to include a method there, that property will also be enumerated.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p></p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title class_">Array</span>.<span class="hljs-property"><span class="hljs-keyword">prototype</span></span>.<span class="hljs-property">foo</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"foo!"</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> array = [<span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>];

<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> array) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(array[i]);
}</code></pre>
<div class="snippet-result"><div class="snippet-ctas"><button type="button" class="s-btn s-btn__primary"><span class="icon-play-white _hover"></span><span> Run code snippet</span></button><input class="copySnippet s-btn s-btn__filled" type="button" value="Copy snippet to answer" style="display: none;"><button type="button" class="s-btn hideResults" style="display: none;">Hide results</button><div class="popout-code"><a class="snippet-expand-link">Expand snippet</a></div></div><div class="snippet-result-code" style="display: none;"><iframe name="sif5" sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-scripts" class="snippet-box-edit snippet-box-result" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></div></div>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>The above code will console log "a", "b", "c", and "foo!".</p>
<p>That can be particularly a problem if you use some library that relies heavily on native prototypes augmentation (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MooTools" rel="noreferrer">MooTools</a>).</p>
<p>The <code>for-in</code> statement, as I said before, is there to <em>enumerate</em> object properties, for example:</p>
<p></p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> obj = {

    <span class="hljs-string">"b"</span>: <span class="hljs-number">2</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">"c"</span>: <span class="hljs-number">3</span>
};

<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> prop <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> obj) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (obj.<span class="hljs-title function_">hasOwnProperty</span>(prop)) {
        <span class="hljs-comment">// or if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj,prop)) for safety...</span>
        <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"prop: "</span> + prop + <span class="hljs-string">" value: "</span> + obj[prop])
    }
}</code></pre>
<div class="snippet-result"><div class="snippet-ctas"><button type="button" class="s-btn s-btn__primary"><span class="icon-play-white _hover"></span><span> Run code snippet</span></button><input class="copySnippet s-btn s-btn__filled" type="button" value="Copy snippet to answer" style="display: none;"><button type="button" class="s-btn hideResults" style="display: none;">Hide results</button><div class="popout-code"><a class="snippet-expand-link">Expand snippet</a></div></div><div class="snippet-result-code" style="display: none;"><iframe name="sif6" sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-scripts" class="snippet-box-edit snippet-box-result" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></div></div>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>In the above example, the <code>hasOwnProperty</code> method allows you to enumerate only <em>own properties</em>. That's it, only the properties that the object physically has, no inherited properties.</p>

<p>Yes, assuming your implementation includes the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-for-in-and-for-of-statements" rel="noreferrer"><code>for</code>...<code>of</code></a> feature introduced in <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/" rel="noreferrer">ECMAScript 2015</a> (the "Harmony" release)... which is a pretty safe assumption these days.</p>

<p>It works like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// REQUIRES ECMASCRIPT 2015+</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> s, myStringArray = [<span class="hljs-string">"Hello"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"World"</span>];
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (s <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> myStringArray) {
  <span class="hljs-comment">// ... do something with s ...</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or better yet, since ECMAScript 2015 also provides block-scoped variables:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// REQUIRES ECMASCRIPT 2015+</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> myStringArray = [<span class="hljs-string">"Hello"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"World"</span>];
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> s <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> myStringArray) {
  <span class="hljs-comment">// ... do something with s ...</span>
}
<span class="hljs-comment">// s is no longer defined here</span>
</code></pre>

<p>(The variable <code>s</code> is different on each iteration, but can still be declared <code>const</code> inside the loop body as long as it isn't modified there.)</p>

<p>A note on sparse arrays: an array in JavaScript may not actually store as many items as reported by its <code>length</code>; that reported number is simply one greater than the highest index at which a value is stored. If the array holds fewer elements than indicated by its length, its said to be <em>sparse</em>. For example, it's perfectly legitimate to have an array with items only at indexes 3, 12, and 247; the <code>length</code> of such an array is reported as 248, though it is only actually storing 3 values.  If you try to access an item at any other index, the array will appear to have the <code>undefined</code> value there. So when you want to "loop through" an array, you have a question to answer: do you want to loop over the full range indicated by its length and process <code>undefined</code>s for any missing elements, or do you only want to process the elements actually present? There are plenty of applications for both approaches; it just depends on what you're using the array for.</p>

<p>If you iterate over an array with <code>for</code>..<code>of</code>, the body of the loop is executed <code>length</code> times, and the loop control variable is set to <code>undefined</code> for any items not actually present in the array. Depending on the details of your "do something with" code, that behavior may be what you want, but if not, you should use a different approach.</p>

<p>Of course, some developers have no choice but to use a different approach anyway, because for whatever reason they're targeting a version of JavaScript that doesn't yet support <code>for</code>...<code>of</code>.</p>

<p>As long as your JavaScript implementation is compliant with the <em>previous</em> edition of the ECMAScript specification (which rules out, for example, versions of Internet Explorer before 9), then you can use the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-array.prototype.foreach" rel="noreferrer"><code>Array#forEach</code></a> iterator method instead of a loop. In that case, you pass a function to be called on each item in the array:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myStringArray = [ <span class="hljs-string">"Hello"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"World"</span> ];
myStringArray.<span class="hljs-title function_">forEach</span>( <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">s</span>) { 
     <span class="hljs-comment">// ... do something with s ...</span>
} );
</code></pre>

<p>Unlike <code>for</code>...<code>of</code>, <code>.forEach</code> only calls the function for elements that are actually present in the array. If passed our hypothetical array with three elements and a length of 248, it will only call the function three times, not 248 times. It also distinguishes between missing elements and elements that are actually set to <code>undefined</code>; for the latter, it will still call the function, passing <code>undefined</code> as the argument. If this is how you want to handle sparse arrays, <code>.forEach</code> may be the way to go even if your interpreter supports <code>for</code>...<code>of</code>.</p>

<p>The final option, which works in <em>all</em> versions of JavaScript, is <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-for-statement" rel="noreferrer">an explicit counting loop</a>. You simply count from 0 up to one less than the length and use the counter as an index. The basic loop looks like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i, s, myStringArray = [ <span class="hljs-string">"Hello"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"World"</span> ], len = myStringArray.<span class="hljs-property">length</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (i=<span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i&lt;len; ++i) {
  s = myStringArray[i];
  <span class="hljs-comment">// ... do something with s ...</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>One advantage of this approach is that you can choose how to handle sparse arrays; the above code will run the body of the loop the full <code>length</code> times, with <code>s</code> set to <code>undefined</code> for any missing elements, just like <code>for</code>..<code>of</code>. If you instead want to handle only the actually-present elements of a sparse array, like <code>.forEach</code>, you can add a simple <code>in</code> test on the index:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i, s, myStringArray = [ <span class="hljs-string">"Hello"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"World"</span> ], len = myStringArray.<span class="hljs-property">length</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (i=<span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i&lt;len; ++i) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (i <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> myStringArray) {
    s = myStringArray[i];
    <span class="hljs-comment">// ... do something with s ...</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Assigning the length value to the local variable (as opposed to including the full <code>myStringArray.length</code> expression in the loop condition) can make a significant difference in performance since it skips a property lookup each time through; using Rhino on my machine, the speedup is 43%. </p>

<p>You may see the length caching done in the loop initialization clause, like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i, len, myStringArray = [ <span class="hljs-string">"Hello"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"World"</span> ];
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (len = myStringArray.<span class="hljs-property">length</span>, i=<span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i&lt;len; ++i) {
</code></pre>

<p>The explicit counting loop also means you have access to the index of each value, should you want it. The index is also passed as an extra parameter to the function you pass to <code>forEach</code>, so you can access it that way as well:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">myStringArray.<span class="hljs-title function_">forEach</span>( <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">s, i</span>) {
   <span class="hljs-comment">// ... do something with s and i ...</span>
});
</code></pre>

<p><code>for</code>...<code>of</code> doesn't give you the index associated with each object, but as long as the object you're iterating over is actually an <code>Array</code> (<code>for</code>..<code>of</code> works for other iterable types which may not have this method), you can use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/entries" rel="noreferrer">Array#entries</a> method to change it to an array of [index, item] pairs, and then iterate over that:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> [i, s] <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> myStringArray.<span class="hljs-title function_">entries</span>()) {
  <span class="hljs-comment">// ... do something with s and i ...</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>for</code>...<code>in</code> syntax mentioned by others is for looping over an object's properties; since an Array in JavaScript is just an object with numeric property names (and an automatically-updated <code>length</code> property), you can theoretically loop over an Array with it.  But the problem is that it doesn't restrict itself to the numeric property values (remember that even methods are actually just properties whose value is a closure), nor is it guaranteed to iterate over those in numeric order. Therefore, the <code>for</code>...<code>in</code> syntax should <em>not</em> be used for looping through Arrays. </p>

<p>The general syntax is:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">array.<span class="hljs-title function_">map</span>(func)

<p>In general <code>func</code> would take one parameter, which is an item of the array. But in the case of JavaScript, it can take a second parameter which is the item's index, and a third parameter which is the array itself.</p>

<p>The return value of <code>array.map</code> is another array, so you can use it like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> x = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>,<span class="hljs-number">4</span>].<span class="hljs-title function_">map</span>( <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">item</span>) {<span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> item * <span class="hljs-number">10</span>;});
</code></pre>

<p>And now x is <code>[10,20,30,40]</code>.</p>

<p>You don't have to write the function inline. It could be a separate function.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> item_processor = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">item</span>) {
      <span class="hljs-comment">// Do something complicated to an item</span>
}

new_list = my_list.<span class="hljs-title function_">map</span>(item_processor);
</code></pre>

<p>which would be sort-of equivalent to:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"> <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (item <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> my_list) {<span class="hljs-title function_">item_processor</span>(item);}
</code></pre>

<p>Except you don't get the <code>new_list</code>.</p>

<p>(Directly answering your question: now you can!)</p>
<p>Most other answers are right, but they do not mention (as of this writing) that <em><strong>ECMAScript <strike>&nbsp;6&nbsp;</strike> 2015</strong></em> is bringing a new mechanism for doing iteration, the <strong><code>for..of</code></strong> loop.</p>
<p>This new syntax is the most elegant way to iterate an array in JavaScript (as long you don't need the iteration index).</p>
<p>It currently works with Firefox 13+, Chrome 37+ and it does not natively work with other browsers (see browser compatibility below). Luckily we have JavaScript compilers (such as <a href="https://babeljs.io/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Babel</a>) that allow us to use next-generation features today.</p>
<p>It also works on Node.js (I tested it on version 0.12.0).</p>

<p>Opera, Safari, Firefox and Chrome now all share a set of enhanced Array methods for optimizing many common loops.</p>

<p>You may not need all of them, but they can be very useful, or would be if every browser supported them.</p>

<p>Mozilla Labs published the algorithms they and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit" rel="noreferrer">WebKit</a> both use, so that you can add them yourself.</p>

<p><strong>filter</strong> returns an array of items that satisfy some condition or test.</p>

<p><strong>every</strong> returns true if every array member passes the test.</p>

<p><strong>some</strong> returns true if any pass the test.</p>

<p><strong>forEach</strong> runs a function on each array member and doesn't return anything.</p>

<p><strong>map</strong> is like forEach, but it returns an array of the results of the operation for each element.</p>

<p>These methods all take a function for their first argument and have an optional second argument, which is an object whose scope you want to impose on the array members as they loop through the function.</p>

<p>Ignore it until you need it.</p>

<p><strong>indexOf</strong> and <strong>lastIndexOf</strong> find the appropriate position of the first or last element that matches its argument exactly.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Since my time in college, I've programmed in Java, JavaScript, Pascal, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABAP" rel="noreferrer">ABAP</a>, PHP, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenEdge_Advanced_Business_Language" rel="noreferrer">Progress 4GL</a>, C/C++ and possibly a few other languages I can't think of right now.</p>
<p>While they all have their own linguistic idiosyncrasies, each of these languages share many of the same basic concepts. Such concepts include procedures / functions, <code>IF</code>-statements, <code>FOR</code>-loops, and <code>WHILE</code>-loops.</p>
<hr>
<h3>A traditional <code>for</code>-loop</h3>
<p>A traditional <code>for</code> loop has three components:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The initialization:</strong> executed before the look block is executed the first time</li>
<li><strong>The condition:</strong> checks a condition every time before the loop block is executed, and quits the loop if false</li>
<li><strong>The afterthought:</strong> performed every time after the loop block is executed</li>
</ol>
<p>These three components are separated from each other by a <code>;</code> symbol. Content for each of these three components is optional, which means that the following is the most minimal <code>for</code> loop possible:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (;;) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Do stuff</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, you will need to include an <code>if(condition === true) { break; }</code>  or an <code>if(condition === true) { return; }</code> somewhere inside that <code>for</code>-loop to get it to stop running.</p>
<p>Usually, though, the initialization is used to declare an index, the condition is used to compare that index with a minimum or maximum value, and the afterthought is used to increment the index:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, length = <span class="hljs-number">10</span>; i &lt; length; i++) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(i);
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h3>Using a traditional <code>for</code> loop to loop through an array</h3>
<p>The traditional way to loop through an array, is this:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, length = myArray.<span class="hljs-property">length</span>; i &lt; length; i++) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(myArray[i]);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Or, if you prefer to loop backwards, you do this:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i = myArray.<span class="hljs-property">length</span> - <span class="hljs-number">1</span>; i &gt; -<span class="hljs-number">1</span>; i--) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(myArray[i]);
}
</code></pre>
<p>There are, however, many variations possible, like for example this one:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> key = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, value = myArray[key], length = myArray.<span class="hljs-property">length</span>; key &lt; length; value = myArray[++key]) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(value);
}
</code></pre>
<p>...or this one...</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, length = myArray.<span class="hljs-property">length</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (; i &lt; length;) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(myArray[i]);
    i++;
}
</code></pre>
<p>...or this one:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> key = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, value;
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (; value = myArray[key++];){
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(value);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Whichever works best is largely a matter of both personal taste and the specific use case you're implementing.</p>
<p>Note that each of these variations is supported by all browsers, including very very old ones!</p>
<hr>
<h3>A <code>while</code> loop</h3>
<p>One alternative to a <code>for</code> loop is a <code>while</code> loop. To loop through an array, you could do this:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> key = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span>(value = myArray[key++]){
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(value);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Like traditional <code>for</code> loops, <code>while</code> loops are supported by even the oldest of browsers.</p>
<p>Also, note that every while loop can be rewritten as a <code>for</code> loop. For example, the <code>while</code> loop hereabove behaves the exact same way as this <code>for</code>-loop:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> key = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; value = myArray[key++];){
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(value);
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h3><code>For...in</code> and <code>for...of</code></h3>
<p>In JavaScript, you can also do this:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (i <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> myArray) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(myArray[i]);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This should be used with care, however, as it doesn't behave the same as a traditional <code>for</code> loop in all cases, and there are potential side-effects that need to be considered. See <strong><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/500504/why-is-using-for-in-with-array-iteration-such-a-bad-idea">Why is using "for...in" for array iteration a bad idea?</a></strong> for more details.</p>
<p>As an alternative to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in" rel="noreferrer"><strong><code>for...in</code></strong></a>, there's now also for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of" rel="noreferrer"><strong><code>for...of</code></strong></a>. The following example shows the difference between a <code>for...of</code> loop and a <code>for...in</code> loop:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myArray = [<span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>, <span class="hljs-number">7</span>];
myArray.<span class="hljs-property">foo</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"hello"</span>;

<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> myArray) {
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(i); <span class="hljs-comment">// logs 0, 1, 2, "foo"</span>
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> myArray) {
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(i); <span class="hljs-comment">// logs 3, 5, 7</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, you need to consider that no version of Internet Explorer supports <code>for...of</code> (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Edge 12+</strong></a> does) and that <code>for...in</code> requires at least Internet&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;10.</p>
<hr>
<h3><code>Array.prototype.forEach()</code></h3>
<p>An alternative to <code>for</code>-loops is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach" rel="noreferrer"><strong><code>Array.prototype.forEach()</code></strong></a>, which uses the following syntax:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">myArray.<span class="hljs-title function_">forEach</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">value, key, myArray</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(value);
});
</code></pre>
<p><code>Array.prototype.forEach()</code> is supported by all modern browsers, as well as Internet&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;9 and later.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Libraries</h3>
<p>Finally, many utility libraries also have their own <code>foreach</code> variation. AFAIK, the three most popular ones are these:</p>
<p><a href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.each/" rel="noreferrer"><strong><code>jQuery.each()</code></strong></a>, in <a href="https://jquery.com/" rel="noreferrer"><strong>jQuery</strong></a>:</p>

<h1>6 different methods to loop through the array</h1>
<p>You can loop through an array by many different methods. I have sorted my 6 favorite methods from top to bottom.</p>
<h2>1. Using for loop</h2>

<p>Some use cases of looping through an array in <strong>the functional programming way</strong> in JavaScript:</p>

<h3>1. Just loop through an array</h3>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> myArray = [{<span class="hljs-attr">x</span>:<span class="hljs-number">100</span>}, {<span class="hljs-attr">x</span>:<span class="hljs-number">200</span>}, {<span class="hljs-attr">x</span>:<span class="hljs-number">300</span>}];

myArray.<span class="hljs-title function_">forEach</span>(<span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">element, index, array</span>) =&gt;</span> {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(element.<span class="hljs-property">x</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// 100, 200, 300</span>
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(index); <span class="hljs-comment">// 0, 1, 2</span>
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(array); <span class="hljs-comment">// same myArray object 3 times</span>
});
</code></pre>

<p>Note: Array.prototype.forEach() is not a functional way strictly speaking, as the function it takes as the input parameter is not supposed to return a value, which thus cannot be regarded as a pure function.</p>

<h3>2. Check if any of the elements in an array pass a test</h3>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> people = [
    {<span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'John'</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">age</span>: <span class="hljs-number">23</span>}, 
    {<span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'Andrew'</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">age</span>: <span class="hljs-number">3</span>},

<h3>3. Transform to a new array</h3>

</code></pre>

<p>Note: The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.</p>

<h3>4. Sum up a particular property, and calculate its average</h3>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> myArray = [{<span class="hljs-attr">x</span>:<span class="hljs-number">100</span>}, {<span class="hljs-attr">x</span>:<span class="hljs-number">200</span>}, {<span class="hljs-attr">x</span>:<span class="hljs-number">300</span>}];

<p><strong>Yes</strong>, you can do the same in JavaScript using a loop, but <strong>not limited</strong> to that. There are many ways to do a loop over arrays in JavaScript. Imagine you have this array below, and you'd like to do a loop over it:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> arr = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">4</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>];
</code></pre>
<p>These are the solutions:</p>
<p><strong>1) For loop</strong></p>
<p>A <code>for</code> loop is a common way looping through arrays in JavaScript, but it is no considered as the fastest solutions for large arrays:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i=<span class="hljs-number">0</span>, l=arr.<span class="hljs-property">length</span>; i&lt;l; i++) {
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(arr[i]);
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>2) While loop</strong></p>
<p>A while loop is considered as the fastest way to loop through long arrays, but it is usually less used in the JavaScript code:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> i=<span class="hljs-number">0</span>;

<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> (arr.<span class="hljs-property">length</span>&gt;i) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(arr[i]);
    i++;
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>3) Do while</strong><br>
A <code>do while</code> is doing the same thing as <code>while</code> with some syntax difference as below:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> i=<span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> {
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(arr[i]);
  i++;
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> (arr.<span class="hljs-property">length</span>&gt;i);
</code></pre>
<p>These are the main ways to do JavaScript loops, but there are a few more ways to do that.</p>
<p>Also we use a <code>for in</code> loop for looping over objects in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Also look at the <code>map()</code>, <code>filter()</code>, <code>reduce()</code>, etc. functions on an Array in JavaScript. They may do things much faster and better than using <code>while</code> and <code>for</code>.</p>
<p>This is a good article if you like to learn more about the asynchronous functions over arrays in JavaScript.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Functional programming has been making quite a splash in the
development world these days. And for good reason: Functional
techniques can help you write more declarative code that is easier to
understand at a glance, refactor, and test.</p>
<p>One of the cornerstones of functional programming is its special use
of lists and list operations. And those things are exactly what the
sound like they are: arrays of things, and the stuff you do to them.
But the functional mindset treats them a bit differently than you
might expect.</p>
<p>This article will take a close look at what I like to call the "big
three" list operations: map, filter, and reduce. Wrapping your head
around these three functions is an important step towards being able
to write clean functional code, and opens the doors to the vastly
powerful techniques of functional and reactive programming.</p>
<p>It also means you'll never have to write a for loop again.</p>

<p>If anybody is interested in the performance side of the multiple mechanisms available for Array iterations, I've prepared the following JSPerf tests:</p>

<p><a href="https://jsperf.com/fastest-array-iterator" rel="noreferrer">https://jsperf.com/fastest-array-iterator</a></p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UOJ9F.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UOJ9F.jpg" alt="Performance results"></a></p>

<h2>Results:</h2>

<p>The traditional <code>for()</code> iterator, is by far the fastest method, especially when used with the <strong>array length cached</strong>.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> arr = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>,<span class="hljs-number">4</span>,<span class="hljs-number">5</span>];

    <span class="hljs-comment">// Do something</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Array.prototype.forEach()</code> and the <code>Array.prototype.map()</code> methods are the slowest approximations, probably as a consequence of the <strong>function call overhead</strong>.</p>

<p>I did not yet see this variation, which I personally like the best:</p>

<p>Given an array:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> someArray = [<span class="hljs-string">"some"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"example"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"array"</span>];

<p>You can loop over it without ever accessing the length property:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i=<span class="hljs-number">0</span>, item; item=someArray[i]; i++) {
  <span class="hljs-comment">// item is "some", then "example", then "array"</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">// i is the index of item in the array</span>
  <span class="hljs-title function_">alert</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"someArray["</span> + i + <span class="hljs-string">"]: "</span> + item);
}
</code></pre>

<p>See this JsFiddle demonstrating that: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/prvzk/" rel="noreferrer">http://jsfiddle.net/prvzk/</a></p>

<p>This only works for arrays that are <em>not</em> sparse. Meaning that there actually is a value at each index in the array. However, I found that in practice I hardly ever use sparse arrays in JavaScript... In such cases it's usually a lot easier to use an object as a map/hashtable. If you do have a sparse array, and want to loop over 0 .. length-1, you need the for (var i=0; i&lt;someArray.length; ++i) construct, but you still need an <code>if</code> inside the loop to check whether the element at the current index is actually defined.</p>

<p>Also, as CMS mentions in a comment below, you can only use this on arrays that don't contain any falsish values. The array of strings from the example works, but if you have empty strings, or numbers that are 0 or NaN, etc. the loop will break off prematurely. Again in practice this is hardly ever a problem for me, but it is something to keep in mind, which makes this a loop to think about before you use it... That may disqualify it for some people :)</p>

<p>What I like about this loop is:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's short to write</li>
<li>No need to access (let alone cache) the length property</li>
<li>The item to access is automatically defined within the loop
body under the name you pick.</li>
<li>Combines very naturally with array.push and array.splice to use arrays like lists/stacks</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason this works is that the array specification mandates that when you read an item from an index &gt;= the array's length, it will return undefined. When you write to such a location it will actually update the length.</p>

<p>For me, this construct most closely emulates the Java 5 syntax that I love:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-title class_">String</span> item : someArray) {
}

<p>If you're using the jQuery library, consider using

<p>From the documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><code>jQuery.each( collection, callback(indexInArray, valueOfElement) )</code></strong> </p>
  
  <p><strong>Returns:</strong> <em>Object</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> <em>A generic iterator function, which can be used to
  seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like
  objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object)
  are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are
  iterated via their named properties.</em></p>
  
  <p>The <code>$.each()</code> function is not the same as <code>$(selector).each()</code>, which is
  used to iterate, exclusively, over a jQuery object. The <code>$.each()</code>
  function can be used to iterate over any collection, whether it is a
  map (JavaScript object) or an array. In the case of an array, the
  callback is passed an array index and a corresponding array value each
  time. (The value can also be accessed through the <code>this</code> keyword, but
  Javascript will always wrap the <code>this</code> value as an <code>Object</code> even if it is
  a simple string or number value.) The method returns its first
  argument, the object that was iterated.</p>

<p>If the order of iteration does not matter then you should try reversed loop. It is the fastest as it reduces overhead condition testing and decrement is in one statement:</p>

<p>This ensures that anything you need in the scope of processing the array stays within that scope, and that you are only processing the values of the array, not the object properties and other members, which is what <code>for ..</code> in does.</p>

<p>Using a regular C-style <code>for</code> loop works in most cases. It is just important to remember that everything within the loop shares its scope with the rest of your program, the { } does not create a new scope.</p>

<p>Hence:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> sum = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> numbers = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">11</span>,<span class="hljs-number">22</span>,<span class="hljs-number">33</span>,<span class="hljs-number">44</span>,<span class="hljs-number">55</span>,<span class="hljs-number">66</span>,<span class="hljs-number">77</span>,<span class="hljs-number">88</span>,<span class="hljs-number">99</span>,<span class="hljs-number">111</span>];

<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i&lt;numbers.<span class="hljs-property">length</span>; ++i){
  sum += numbers[i];
}

<span class="hljs-title function_">alert</span>(i);
</code></pre>

<p>will output "11" - which may or may not be what you want.</p>

If the array holds fewer elements than indicated by its length, its said to be \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;sparse\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;. For example, it\u0026apos;s perfectly legitimate to have an array with items only at indexes 3, 12, and 247; the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;length\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; of such an array is reported as 248, though it is only actually storing 3 values.  If you try to access an item at any other index, the array will appear to have the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;undefined\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; value there. So when you want to \u0026quot;loop through\u0026quot; an array, you have a question to answer: do you want to loop over the full range indicated by its length and process \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;undefined\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;s for any missing elements, or do you only want to process the elements actually present? There are plenty of applications for both approaches; it just depends on what you\u0026apos;re using the array for.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If you iterate over an array with \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;for\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;..\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;of\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, the body of the loop is executed \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;length\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; times, and the loop control variable is set to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;undefined\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; for any items not actually present in the array. Depending on the details of your \u0026quot;do something with\u0026quot; code, that behavior may be what you want, but if not, you should use a different approach.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Of course, some developers have no choice but to use a different approach anyway, because for whatever reason they\u0026apos;re targeting a version of JavaScript that doesn\u0026apos;t yet support \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;for\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;...\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;of\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;As long as your JavaScript implementation is compliant with the \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;previous\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; edition of the ECMAScript specification (which rules out, for example, versions of Internet Explorer before 9), then you can use the \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-array.prototype.foreach\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Array#forEach\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; iterator method instead of a loop.

Wrapping your head\naround these three functions is an important step towards being able\nto write clean functional code, and opens the doors to the vastly\npowerful techniques of functional and reactive programming.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;It also means you\u0026apos;ll never have to write a for loop again.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Read more\u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;gt;

rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;http://jsfiddle.net/prvzk/\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This only works for arrays that are \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;not\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; sparse. Meaning that there actually is a value at each index in the array. However, I found that in practice I hardly ever use sparse arrays in JavaScript... In such cases it\u0026apos;s usually a lot easier to use an object as a map/hashtable. If you do have a sparse array, and want to loop over 0 .. length-1, you need the for (var i=0; i\u0026amp;lt;someArray.length; ++i) construct, but you still need an \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;if\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; inside the loop to check whether the element at the current index is actually defined.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Also, as CMS mentions in a comment below, you can only use this on arrays that don\u0026apos;t contain any falsish values. The array of strings from the example works, but if you have empty strings, or numbers that are 0 or NaN, etc. the loop will break off prematurely. Again in practice this is hardly ever a problem for me, but it is something to keep in mind, which makes this a loop to think about before you use it... That may disqualify it for some people :)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;What I like about this loop is:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;It\u0026apos;s short to write\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;No need to access (let alone cache) the length property\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;The item to access is automatically defined within the loop\nbody under the name you pick.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Combines very naturally with array.push and array.splice to use arrays like lists/stacks\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The reason this works is that the array specification mandates that when you read an item from an index \u0026amp;gt;= the array\u0026apos;s length, it will return undefined. When you write to such a location it will actually update the length.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;For me, this construct most closely emulates the Java 5 syntax that I love:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-js s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;for\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; (\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title class_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;String\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; item : someArray) {\n}\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;... with the added benefit of also knowing about the current index inside the loop\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If you\u0026apos;re using the jQuery library, consider using \n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;From the documentation:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n  \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;jQuery.each( collection, callback(indexInArray, valueOfElement) )\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n  \n  \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Returns:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;Object\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n  \n  \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Description:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;A generic iterator function, which can be used to\n  seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays.
