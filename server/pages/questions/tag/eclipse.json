This\n  will cause your &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; to break. Look\n  out for these erroneous import\n  statements and delete them.*&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While going through the Android sample tutorials, I would often use the &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;O&lt;/kbd&gt; command to &quot;Organize Imports&quot; and generate any missing import statements. Sometimes this would generate the incorrect import statement which would hide the &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; class that is automatically generated when you build.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Each time I had a problem with R not been generated, or even disappeared, this was due to some problem in the XML layout file that prevented the application from being built.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Whenever you get &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;R cannot be resolved&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;then check for the &lt;code&gt;/res&lt;/code&gt; directory and there must be some file that have some error in it and that is preventing the application from being built. For example, it may be a layout file or it may be due to some missing resource is, but you already defined it in the XML file.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any additional, even unused (!) or unreferenced (!) images in a folder like res/drawables-mdpi which do not comply to the file naming conventions (may contain only [a-z0-9_.]), the R.java class might not generate, causing the chain of events all the other posts referred to. Hope it helps!&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;my project have include a r.java.at the beginning ,R.layout.main work good.But,after adding some code it doesn&apos;t work,and the error is R.layout.main can&apos;t resolved.what&apos;s the problem?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look at your imports. Chances are that the line:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;default s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-cpp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; android.R;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;will be there. If that&apos;s the case, remove it, so that your project will resolve R not with the default Android Resources class, but with the one auto-generated from your /res/ folder.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;And another thing which may cause this problem:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I installed the new ADT (v. 22). It stopped creating &lt;code&gt;gen&lt;/code&gt; folder which includes &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt;. The solution was to also install new Android SDK Build Tools from Android SDK Manager.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Solution found &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/android-developers/rCaeT3qckoE&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;What Will said was right&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;R is an automatically generated class that holds the constants used to identify your &amp;gt;resources. If you don&apos;t have an R.java file (it would be gen/eu.mauriziopz.gps/R.java in &amp;gt;Eclipse with the 1.5 SDK) I would recommend closing and reopening your project or going to &amp;gt;Project &amp;gt; Build all (and selecting &quot;Build Automatically&quot; while there as recommended by &amp;gt;Josef). If that doesn&apos;t work than try making a new project, if the problem is recreated than &amp;gt;post here again and we&apos;ll go into more detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but I&apos;ve found out that there was another problem that was causing the first one. The tools in the SDK directory didn&apos;t have the permissions to be executed, so it was like the didn&apos;t exist for Eclipse, thus it didn&apos;t build the &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So modifying the permission and selecting &quot;Build Automatically&quot; solved the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; is a file that the Android Eclipse plugins creates while\nbuilding your application. &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; is created under the &quot;gen&quot;\ndirectory. This file is generated from the information in the &quot;res&quot;\ndirectory. If you run select &quot;Project&quot; -&amp;gt; &quot;Clean...&quot; on the Eclipse\nmenu, it will remove and then regenerate the &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem &quot;R cannot be resolved&quot; happens when you change your\npackage name in the &lt;code&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/code&gt; file. It uses your Android\npackage name to create a subdirectory under the &quot;gen&quot; directory where\nit stores the &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eclipse may have problems executing clean, because it is confused about\nwhere the &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; file is when you have changed the Android package\nname. You can either rename the subdirectory under &lt;code&gt;gen&lt;/code&gt; to match your\nnew package name, or you can change your package name back to the old\nname. Do the clean and then change the package name to the new name\nyou want. This works best if you stop Eclipse from trying to build\nwhile you are changing the package name. Under the &quot;Project&quot; menu\nuncheck the option to &quot;Build Automatically&quot; and also when the\n&quot;Clean...&quot; dialog asks if it should &quot;Start a build immediately&quot;\nuncheck the box so it doesn&apos;t try to build while you are changing the\npackage name. After you have changed the name you can turn &quot;Build\nAutomatically&quot; back on again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that if your &lt;code&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/code&gt; file package name does not match\nyour Java package name, Eclipse will end up automatically adding an\n&quot;import &amp;lt;your Android package name&amp;gt;.R;&quot; line in all your &lt;code&gt;.java&lt;/code&gt; files\nthat have any references to R. If you change your &lt;code&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/code&gt;\npackage name, sometimes Eclipse does not update all of these added\nimports. If that happens, use the Eclipse refactoring (&lt;kbd&gt;ALT&lt;/kbd&gt; +\n&lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;R&lt;/kbd&gt;) to change the import statement in one of your Java files to\nyour new &lt;code&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/code&gt; package name. It is best to do this\nwhile you have disabled &quot;Build Automatically&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;R is an automatically generated class that holds the constants used to identify your resources.  If you don&apos;t have an R.java file (it would be gen/eu.mauriziopz.gps/R.java in Eclipse with the 1.5 SDK) I would recommend closing and reopening your project or going to Project &amp;gt; Build all (and selecting &quot;Build Automatically&quot; while there as recommended by Josef).  If that doesn&apos;t work than try making a new project, if the problem is recreated than post here again and we&apos;ll go into more detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Close all files, clean project, restart Eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;It is worth checking in &lt;code&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/code&gt;.

I had a .jpg image in my drawable folder with the same name as a .png image.  Referencing this image in my code must have confused the program and it gave the &quot;R cannot be resolved&quot; error.  &lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Make sure you installed the Android build tool form sdk manager&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;project right click properties-&amp;gt; Java BuildPath select Library and add android-support.jar the follow these step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go to Project-&amp;gt;Properties-&amp;gt;Java Build Path than select Order and export tab. Set android-support .jar library checked and up it into top of the list.

All your XML filenames in &lt;code&gt;/res&lt;/code&gt; must match &lt;code&gt;[a-z0-9\\\\._]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Simplest solution - Sometimes you just need to save the XML file you were working on to get the autogenerator to kick in.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Save the file (e.g. main.xml) then delete the R.java file and see if the regenerated R.java resolves the R resolve problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Check the XML file names.  Be sure that they&apos;re all in lowercase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also make sure that any image resource names are also all in LOWER CASE. I had a capital letter in the name of my jpg file, and it caused the R unresolved error right across my project.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; is a generated class.

It turned out that the result was a failure in the &lt;code&gt;ADB&lt;/code&gt; binary, because the &lt;code&gt;ia32-libs&lt;/code&gt; package was not installed. Simply running &lt;code&gt;apt-get install ia32-libs&lt;/code&gt; and relaunching Eclipse fixed the error.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your x64 distro does not have ia32-libs, you&apos;ll have to go Multiarch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check #4 and #5 on this post:\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=277883#p277883&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=277883#p277883&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;You may need to update/install SDK tools.

It turned out that I had inadvertently deleted the &quot;app_name&quot; string resource from the &lt;code&gt;strings.xml&lt;/code&gt; file, which was causing a silent error. Once I added it back, the R class was generated successfully and everything was back up and running.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;You may need to update SDK tools.

For example, use &lt;code&gt;my_file.xml&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;myFile.xml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Yet another reason &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; might not get autogenerated is if you have directories like &lt;strong&gt;res/drawable-hdpi&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;res/drawable-mdpi&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;res/drawable-ldpi&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.6+ seems to be OK with these directories, but 1.5 doesn&apos;t want them. When I removed those directories, &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; started autogenerating for me again.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Often times this is because of the MinSDK version number you supplied when creating the project.  Example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want 2.1 to be the minimum, Android 2.1 is actually API Level 7.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can see what I am talking about when you browse the SDK you downloaded and installed.  Navigate to the place you installed the SDK to (&lt;code&gt;C:\\android-sdk-windows&lt;/code&gt; for example) and open the folder named &quot;platforms&quot;. You will see something like &quot;android-7&quot; listed as a folder, and if you open that there is a &lt;code&gt;source.properties&lt;/code&gt; file that, when opened with a text editor, will show you the corresponding platform version.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you create a project, and you must select a &quot;Build Target&quot; API, the last column in that list named &quot;API Level&quot; shows the number you are looking for when populating the MinSDK setting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is probably one of the most common mistakes that results in the &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; file not being created under Project &amp;gt; gen &amp;gt; packagename &amp;gt; R.java.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Remove &lt;code&gt;main.out.xml&lt;/code&gt;.

Hmmmm. After looking in &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt;, I found an auto-generated class, &lt;code&gt;XML.java&lt;/code&gt;, (I think) was not there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Solution? It needed a new folder in &lt;code&gt;res&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;res\\xml&lt;/code&gt; and a file called &lt;code&gt;default_values.xml&lt;/code&gt;\nin there.

For example, &lt;code&gt;/opt/android-sdk&lt;/code&gt;. Its important to set both &lt;code&gt;ANDROID_SDK_ROOT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ANDROID_NDK_ROOT&lt;/code&gt; because the Android tools use them internally.
