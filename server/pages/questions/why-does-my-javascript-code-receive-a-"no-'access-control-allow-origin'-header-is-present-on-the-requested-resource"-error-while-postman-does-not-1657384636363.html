I am trying to do authorization using JavaScript by connecting to the RESTful API built-in Flask. However, when I make the request, I get the following error:

XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://myApiUrl/login. No &#x27;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&#x27; header is present on the requested resource. Origin &#x27;null&#x27; is therefore not allowed access.

I know that the API or remote resource must set the header, but why did it work when I made the request via the Chrome extension Postman?
This is the request code:
$.ajax({
  type: &#x27;POST&#x27;,
  dataType: &#x27;text&#x27;,
  url: api,
  username: &#x27;user&#x27;,
  password: &#x27;pass&#x27;,
  crossDomain: true,
  xhrFields: {
    withCredentials: true,
  },
})
  .done(function (data) {
    console.log(&#x27;done&#x27;);
  })
  .fail(function (xhr, textStatus, errorThrown) {
    alert(xhr.responseText);
    alert(textStatus);
  });

Quoted from Cross-Origin XMLHttpRequest:\n\nRegular web pages can use the XMLHttpRequest object to send and receive data from remote servers, but they&apos;re limited by the same origin policy.

I assume that your page is on http://my-site.local:8088.\nNOTE: The API and your page have different domains!\nThe reason why you see different results is that Postman:\n\nset header Host=example.com (your API)\nNOT set header Origin\nPostman actually not use your website url at all (you only type your API address into Postman) - he only send request to API, so he assume that website has same address as API (browser not assume this)\n\nThis is similar to browsers&apos; way of sending requests when the site and API has the same domain (browsers also set the header item Referer=http://my-site.local:8088, however I don&apos;t see it in Postman). When Origin header is not set, usually servers allow such requests by default.\n\nThis is the standard way how Postman sends requests. But a browser sends requests differently when your site and API have different domains, and then CORS occurs and the browser automatically:\n\nsets header Host=example.com (yours as API)\nsets header Origin=http://my-site.local:8088 (your site)\n\n(The header Referer has the same value as Origin). And now in Chrome&apos;s Console &amp; Networks tab you will see:\n\n\nWhen you have Host != Origin this is CORS, and when the server detects such a request, it usually blocks it by default.\nOrigin=null is set when you open HTML content from a local directory, and it sends a request. The same situation is when you send a request inside an &lt;iframe&gt;, like in the below snippet (but here the Host header is not set at all) - in general, everywhere the HTML specification says opaque origin, you can translate that to Origin=null.

<p>I am trying to do authorization using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" rel="noreferrer">JavaScript</a> by connecting to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#RESTful_web_services" rel="noreferrer">RESTful</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" rel="noreferrer">API</a> built-in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_%28web_framework%29" rel="noreferrer">Flask</a>. However, when I make the request, I get the following error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://myApiUrl/login. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know that the API or remote resource must set the header, but why did it work when I made the request via the Chrome extension <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop" rel="noreferrer">Postman</a>?</p>
<p>This is the request code:</p>

<p>If I understood it right you are doing an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest" rel="noreferrer">XMLHttpRequest</a> to a different domain than your page is on. So the browser is blocking it as it usually allows a request in the same origin for security reasons. You need to do something different when you want to do a cross-domain request. A tutorial about how to achieve that is <em><a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/" rel="noreferrer">Using CORS</a></em>.</p>
<p>When you are using Postman they are not restricted by this policy. Quoted from <em><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/xhr/" rel="noreferrer">Cross-Origin XMLHttpRequest</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regular web pages can use the XMLHttpRequest object to send and receive data from remote servers, but they're limited by the same origin policy. Extensions aren't so limited. An extension can talk to remote servers outside of its origin, as long as it first requests cross-origin permissions.</p>

<p>It's very simple to solve if you are using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP" rel="noreferrer">PHP</a>. Just add the following script in the beginning of your PHP page which handles the request:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;?php <span class="hljs-title function_">header</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *'</span>); ?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node-RED" rel="noreferrer">Node-red</a> you have to allow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing" rel="noreferrer">CORS</a> in the <code>node-red/settings.js</code> file by un-commenting the following lines:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// The following property can be used to configure cross-origin resource sharing</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// in the HTTP nodes.</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// See https://github.com/troygoode/node-cors#configuration-options for</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// details on its contents. The following is a basic permissive set of options:</span>

 <span class="hljs-attr">methods</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"GET,PUT,POST,DELETE"</span>
},
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" rel="noreferrer">Flask</a> same as the question; you have first to install <code>flask-cors</code></p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$ pip install -U flask-cors
</code></pre>

<p>Then include the Flask cors in your application.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> flask_cors <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> <span class="hljs-variable constant_">CORS</span>

<h1>Deep</h1>
<p>In the below investigation as API, I use <a href="http://example.com" rel="noreferrer">http://example.com</a> instead of http://myApiUrl/login from your question, because this first one working. I assume that your page is on <a href="http://my-site.local:8088" rel="noreferrer">http://my-site.local:8088</a>.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The API and your page have different domains!</p>
<p>The reason why you see different results is that Postman:</p>
<ul>
<li>set header <code>Host=example.com</code> (your API)</li>
<li>NOT set header <code>Origin</code></li>
<li>Postman actually not use your website url at all (you only type your API address into Postman) - he only send request to API, so he assume that website has same address as API (browser not assume this)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is similar to browsers' way of sending requests when the site and API has the same domain (browsers also set the header item <code>Referer=http://my-site.local:8088</code>, however I don't see it in Postman). <strong>When <code>Origin</code> header is <em>not</em> set, usually servers allow such requests by default.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XLrRg.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XLrRg.png" alt="Enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>This is the standard way how Postman sends requests. But a browser sends requests differently when <strong>your site and API have different domains</strong>, and then <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS" rel="noreferrer">CORS</a> occurs and the browser automatically:</p>
<ul>
<li>sets header <code>Host=example.com</code> (yours as API)</li>
<li>sets header <code>Origin=http://my-site.local:8088</code> (your site)</li>
</ul>
<p>(The header <code>Referer</code> has the same value as <code>Origin</code>). And now in Chrome's <em>Console &amp; Networks</em> tab you will see:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oZkcL.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oZkcL.png" alt="Enter image description here"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ITev.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ITev.png" alt="Enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>When you have <strong><code>Host != Origin</code></strong> this is CORS, and when the server detects such a request, it usually <strong>blocks it by default</strong>.</p>
<p><code>Origin=null</code> is set when you open HTML content from a local directory, and it sends a request. The same situation is when you send a request inside an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, like in the below snippet (but here the <code>Host</code> header is not set at all) - in general, everywhere the HTML specification says opaque origin, you can translate that to <code>Origin=null</code>. More information about this you can find <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42239643/when-do-browsers-send-the-origin-header-when-do-browsers-set-the-origin-to-null/42242802#42242802">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not use a simple CORS request, usually the browser automatically also sends an OPTIONS request before sending the main request - more information is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10093053/access-control-request-headers-is-added-to-header-in-ajax-request-with-jquery/55584963#55584963">here</a>.

<p></p>
<p>You can change the configuration of your server to allow CORS requests.</p>
<p>Here is an example configuration which turns on <strong>CORS on nginx</strong> (nginx.conf file) - be very careful with setting <code>always/"$http_origin"</code> for nginx and <code>"*"</code> for Apache - this will unblock CORS from any domain (in production instead of stars use your concrete page adres which consume your api)</p>

<p>Applying a CORS restriction is a security feature defined by a server and implemented by a <strong>browser</strong>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The browser looks at the CORS policy of the server and respects it.</p>

<p>However, the Postman tool does not bother about the CORS policy of the server.</p>

<p>That is why the CORS error appears in the browser, but not in Postman.</p>

<p>The error you get is due to the CORS standard, which sets some restrictions on how JavaScript can perform ajax requests.</p>
<p>The CORS standard is a client-side standard, implemented in the browser. So it is the browser which prevent the call from completing and generates the error message - not the server.</p>
<p>Postman does not implement the CORS restrictions, which is why you don't see the same error when making the same call from Postman.</p>
<p><em>Why</em> doesn't Postman implement CORS? CORS defines the restrictions relative to the origin (URL domain) of the page which initiates the request. But in Postman the requests doesn't originate from a page with an URL so CORS does not apply.</p>

<h2>Solution &amp; Issue Origins</h2>
<p>You are making a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest" rel="noreferrer">XMLHttpRequest</a> to different domains, example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Domain one: <code>some-domain.com</code></li>
<li>Domain Two: <code>some-different-domain.com</code></li>
</ol>
<p>This difference in domain names triggers <strong>CORS</strong> (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS" rel="noreferrer">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a>) policy called <strong>SOP</strong> (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS" rel="noreferrer">Same-Origin Policy</a>) that enforces the use of same domains (hence <em>Origin</em>) in <a href="https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax" rel="noreferrer">Ajax</a>, XMLHttpRequest and other HTTP requests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why did it work when I made the request via the Chrome extension
Postman?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A client (most <strong>Browsers</strong> and <strong>Development Tools</strong>) has a choice to enforce the Same-Origin Policy.</p>
<p><em>Most browsers enforce the policy of Same-Origin Policy to prevent issues related to <strong>CSRF</strong> (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSRF" rel="noreferrer">Cross-Site Request Forgery</a>) attack.</em></p>
<p><strong>Postman</strong> as a development tool chooses not to enforce SOP while some browsers enforce, this is why you can send requests via Postman that you cannot send with XMLHttpRequest via JS using the browser.</p>

<p>You might also get this error if your gateway timeout is too short and the resource you are accessing takes longer to process than the timeout. This may be the case for complex database queries etc. Thus, the above error code can be disguishing this problem. Just check if the error code is 504 instead of 404 as in Kamils answer above or something else. If it is 504, then increasing the gateway timeout might fix the problem.</p>
<p>In my case the CORS error could be removed by disabling the same origin policy (CORS) in the IE browser, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20947359/how-to-disable-same-origin-policy-internet-explorer">How to disable same origin policy Internet Explorer</a>. After doing this it was a pure 504 error in the log.</p>
