An inner join of df1 and df2:
Return only the rows in which the left table have matching keys in the right table.
An outer join of df1 and df2:
Returns all rows from both tables, join records from the left which have matching keys in the right table.
A left outer join (or simply left join) of df1 and df2
Return all rows from the left table, and any rows with matching keys from the right table.
A right outer join of df1 and df2
Return all rows from the right table, and any rows with matching keys from the left table.

It even offers quite an elaborate SQL interface, and even a function to convert (most) SQL code directly into R.\n\nThe four joining-related functions in the dplyr package are (to quote):\n\n\ninner_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, ...): return all rows from\nx where there are matching values in y, and all columns from x and y \nleft_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, ...): return all rows from x, and all columns from x and y \nsemi_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, ...): return all rows from x where there are matching values in\ny, keeping just columns from x.  \nanti_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, ...): return all rows from x\nwhere there are not matching values in y, keeping just columns from x\n\n\nIt&apos;s all here in great detail.\n\nSelecting columns can be done by select(df,&quot;column&quot;). If that&apos;s not SQL-ish enough for you, then there&apos;s the sql() function, into which you can enter SQL code as-is, and it will do the operation you specified just like you were writing in R all along (for more information, please refer to the dplyr/databases vignette).

This is effectively df1 left join df2:\n\ndf1 &lt;- data.frame(CustomerId=1:6,Product=c(rep(&apos;Toaster&apos;,3L),rep(&apos;Radio&apos;,3L)));\ndf2 &lt;- data.frame(CustomerId=c(2L,4L,6L,7L),State=c(rep(&apos;Alabama&apos;,2L),&apos;Ohio&apos;,&apos;Texas&apos;));\ndf1[names(df2)[-1L]] &lt;- df2[match(df1[,1L],df2[,1L]),-1L];\ndf1;\n##   CustomerId Product   State\n## 1          1 Toaster    &lt;NA&gt;\n## 2          2 Toaster Alabama\n## 3          3 Toaster    &lt;NA&gt;\n## 4          4   Radio Alabama\n## 5          5   Radio    &lt;NA&gt;\n## 6          6   Radio    Ohio\n\n\nIn the above I hard-coded an assumption that the key column is the first column of both input tables. I would argue that, in general, this is not an unreasonable assumption, since, if you have a data.frame with a key column, it would be strange if it had not been set up as the first column of the data.frame from the outset. And you can always reorder the columns to make it so. An advantageous consequence of this assumption is that the name of the key column does not have to be hard-coded, although I suppose it&apos;s just replacing one assumption with another. Concision is another advantage of integer indexing, as well as speed. In the benchmarks below I&apos;ll change the implementation to use string name indexing to match the competing implementations.\n\nI think this is a particularly appropriate solution if you have several tables that you want to left join against a single large table. Repeatedly rebuilding the entire table for each merge would be unnecessary and inefficient.\n\nOn the other hand, if you need the joinee to remain unaltered through this operation for whatever reason, then this solution cannot be used, since it modifies the joinee directly. Although in that case you could simply make a copy and perform the in-place assignment(s) on the copy.\n\n\n\nAs a side note, I briefly looked into possible matching solutions for multicolumn keys. Unfortunately, the only matching solutions I found were:\n\n\ninefficient concatenations. e.g. match(interaction(df1$a,df1$b),interaction(df2$a,df2$b)), or the same idea with paste().\ninefficient cartesian conjunctions, e.g. outer(df1$a,df2$a,`==`) &amp; outer(df1$b,df2$b,`==`).\nbase R merge() and equivalent package-based merge functions, which always allocate a new table to return the merged result, and thus are not suitable for an in-place assignment-based solution.\n\n\nFor example, see Matching multiple columns on different data frames and getting other column as result, match two columns with two other columns, Matching on multiple columns, and the dupe of this question where I originally came up with the in-place solution, Combine two data frames with different number of rows in R.\n\n\n\nBenchmarking\n\nI decided to do my own benchmarking to see how the in-place assignment approach compares to the other solutions that have been offered in this question.\n\nTesting code:\n\nlibrary(microbenchmark);\nlibrary(data.table);\nlibrary(sqldf);\nlibrary(plyr);\nlibrary(dplyr);\n\nsolSpecs &lt;- list(\n    merge=list(testFuncs=list(\n        inner=function(df1,df2,key) merge(df1,df2,key),\n        left =function(df1,df2,key) merge(df1,df2,key,all.x=T),\n        right=function(df1,df2,key) merge(df1,df2,key,all.y=T),\n        full =function(df1,df2,key) merge(df1,df2,key,all=T)\n    )),\n    data.table.unkeyed=list(argSpec=&apos;data.table.unkeyed&apos;,testFuncs=list(\n        inner=function(dt1,dt2,key) dt1[dt2,on=key,nomatch=0L,allow.cartesian=T],\n        left =function(dt1,dt2,key) dt2[dt1,on=key,allow.cartesian=T],\n        right=function(dt1,dt2,key) dt1[dt2,on=key,allow.cartesian=T],\n        full =function(dt1,dt2,key) merge(dt1,dt2,key,all=T,allow.cartesian=T) ## calls merge.data.table()\n    )),\n    data.table.keyed=list(argSpec=&apos;data.table.keyed&apos;,testFuncs=list(\n        inner=function(dt1,dt2) dt1[dt2,nomatch=0L,allow.cartesian=T],\n        left =function(dt1,dt2) dt2[dt1,allow.cartesian=T],\n        right=function(dt1,dt2) dt1[dt2,allow.cartesian=T],\n        full =function(dt1,dt2) merge(dt1,dt2,all=T,allow.cartesian=T) ## calls merge.data.table()\n    )),\n    sqldf.unindexed=list(testFuncs=list( ## note: must pass connection=NULL to avoid running against the live DB connection, which would result in collisions with the residual tables from the last query upload\n        inner=function(df1,df2,key) sqldf(paste0(&apos;select * from df1 inner join df2 using(&apos;,paste(collapse=&apos;,&apos;,key),&apos;)&apos;),connection=NULL),\n        left =function(df1,df2,key) sqldf(paste0(&apos;select * from df1 left join df2 using(&apos;,paste(collapse=&apos;,&apos;,key),&apos;)&apos;),connection=NULL),\n        right=function(df1,df2,key) sqldf(paste0(&apos;select * from df2 left join df1 using(&apos;,paste(collapse=&apos;,&apos;,key),&apos;)&apos;),connection=NULL) ## can&apos;t do right join proper, not yet supported;

(In general it&apos;s not advisable to define key columns with double or complex values due to floating-point comparison complications, and basically no one ever uses the raw type, much less for key columns, so I haven&apos;t included those types in the key columns. Also, for information&apos;s sake, I initially tried to use four key columns by including a POSIXct key column, but the POSIXct type didn&apos;t play well with the sqldf.indexed solution for some reason, possibly due to floating-point comparison anomalies, so I removed it.)\n\nmakeArgSpecs.assortedKey.optionalManyToMany &lt;- function(size,overlap,uniquePct=75) {\n\n    ## number of unique keys in df1\n    u1Size &lt;- as.integer(size*uniquePct/100);\n\n    ## (roughly) divide u1Size into bases, so we can use expand.grid() to produce the required number of unique key values with repetitions within individual key columns\n    ## use ceiling() to ensure we cover u1Size; will truncate afterward\n    u1SizePerKeyColumn &lt;- as.integer(ceiling(u1Size^(1/3)));\n\n    ## generate the unique key values for df1\n    keys1 &lt;- expand.grid(stringsAsFactors=F,\n        idCharacter=replicate(u1SizePerKeyColumn,paste(collapse=&apos;&apos;,sample(letters,sample(4:12,1L),T))),\n        idInteger=sample(u1SizePerKeyColumn),\n        idLogical=sample(c(F,T),u1SizePerKeyColumn,T)\n        ##idPOSIXct=as.POSIXct(&apos;2016-01-01 00:00:00&apos;,&apos;UTC&apos;)+sample(u1SizePerKeyColumn)\n    )[seq_len(u1Size),];\n\n    ## rbind some repetitions of the unique keys; this will prepare one side of the many-to-many relationship\n    ## also scramble the order afterward\n    keys1 &lt;- rbind(keys1,keys1[sample(nrow(keys1),size-u1Size,T),])[sample(size),];\n\n    ## common and unilateral key counts\n    com &lt;- as.integer(size*overlap);\n    uni &lt;- size-com;\n\n    ## generate some unilateral keys for df2 by synthesizing outside of the idInteger range of df1\n    keys2 &lt;- data.frame(stringsAsFactors=F,\n        idCharacter=replicate(uni,paste(collapse=&apos;&apos;,sample(letters,sample(4:12,1L),T))),\n        idInteger=u1SizePerKeyColumn+sample(uni),\n        idLogical=sample(c(F,T),uni,T)\n        ##idPOSIXct=as.POSIXct(&apos;2016-01-01 00:00:00&apos;,&apos;UTC&apos;)+u1SizePerKeyColumn+sample(uni)\n    );\n\n    ## rbind random keys from df1; this will complete the many-to-many relationship\n    ## also scramble the order afterward\n    keys2 &lt;- rbind(keys2,keys1[sample(nrow(keys1),com,T),])[sample(size),];\n\n    ##keyNames &lt;- c(&apos;idCharacter&apos;,&apos;idInteger&apos;,&apos;idLogical&apos;,&apos;idPOSIXct&apos;);\n    keyNames &lt;- c(&apos;idCharacter&apos;,&apos;idInteger&apos;,&apos;idLogical&apos;);\n    ## note: was going to use raw and complex type for two of the non-key columns, but data.table doesn&apos;t seem to fully support them\n    argSpecs &lt;- list(\n        default=list(copySpec=1:2,args=list(\n            df1 &lt;- cbind(stringsAsFactors=F,keys1,y1=sample(c(F,T),size,T),y2=sample(size),y3=rnorm(size),y4=replicate(size,paste(collapse=&apos;&apos;,sample(letters,sample(4:12,1L),T)))),\n            df2 &lt;- cbind(stringsAsFactors=F,keys2,y5=sample(c(F,T),size,T),y6=sample(size),y7=rnorm(size),y8=replicate(size,paste(collapse=&apos;&apos;,sample(letters,sample(4:12,1L),T)))),\n            keyNames\n        )),\n        data.table.unkeyed=list(copySpec=1:2,args=list(\n            as.data.table(df1),\n            as.data.table(df2),\n            keyNames\n        )),\n        data.table.keyed=list(copySpec=1:2,args=list(\n            setkeyv(as.data.table(df1),keyNames),\n            setkeyv(as.data.table(df2),keyNames)\n        ))\n    );\n    ## prepare sqldf\n    initSqldf();\n    sqldf(paste0(&apos;create index df1_key on df1(&apos;,paste(collapse=&apos;,&apos;,keyNames),&apos;);&apos;)); ## upload and create an sqlite index on df1\n    sqldf(paste0(&apos;create index df2_key on df2(&apos;,paste(collapse=&apos;,&apos;,keyNames),&apos;);&apos;)); ## upload and create an sqlite index on df2\n\n    argSpecs;\n\n}; ## end makeArgSpecs.assortedKey.optionalManyToMany()\n\nsizes &lt;- c(1e1L,1e3L,1e5L); ## 1e5L instead of 1e6L to respect more heavy-duty inputs\noverlaps &lt;- c(0.99,0.5,0.01);\nsolTypes &lt;- setdiff(getSolTypes(),&apos;in.place&apos;);\nsystem.time({ res &lt;- testGrid(makeArgSpecs.assortedKey.optionalManyToMany,sizes,overlaps,solTypes); });\n##     user   system  elapsed\n## 38895.50   784.19 39745.53\n\n\nThe resulting plots, using the same plotting code given above:\n\ntitleFunc &lt;- function(overlap) sprintf(&apos;R merge solutions: character/integer/logical key, 0..*:0..* cardinality, %d%% overlap&apos;,as.integer(overlap*100));\nplotRes(res,titleFunc,F);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution9","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"In joining two data frames with ~1 million rows each, one with 2 columns and the other with ~20, I&apos;ve surprisingly found merge(..., all.x = TRUE, all.y = TRUE) to be faster then dplyr::full_join().

The approach above works well when we are joining on only a single column and are satisfied with the first match. Suppose we want the year of measurement in the customer table to match the year of sale.\n\nAs @bgoldst&apos;s answer mentions, match with interaction might be an option for this case.

Alternately, we may want to take the last state the customer was found in:\n\nsales[, State := cust[sales, on=.(CustomerId, Year), roll=TRUE, x.State]]\n\n#    CustomerId Year Product    State\n# 1:          1 2000 Toaster     &lt;NA&gt;\n# 2:          1 2001 Toaster  Alabama\n# 3:          1 2002 Toaster   Alaska\n# 4:          3 2003   Radio     &lt;NA&gt;\n# 5:          4 2004   Radio  Arizona\n# 6:          6 2005   Radio Arkansas\n\n\n\n\nThe three examples above all focus on creating/adding a new column.

<p>By using the <code>merge</code> function and its optional parameters:</p>

<p><strong><em>Inner join:</em></strong> <code>merge(df1, df2)</code> will work for these examples because R automatically joins the frames by common variable names, but you would most likely want to specify <code>merge(df1, df2, by = "CustomerId")</code> to make sure that you were matching on only the fields you desired.  You can also use the <code>by.x</code> and <code>by.y</code> parameters if the matching variables have different names in the different data frames.</p>

<p><strong><em>Outer join:</em></strong> <code>merge(x = df1, y = df2, by = "CustomerId", all = TRUE)</code></p>

<p><strong><em>Left outer:</em></strong> <code>merge(x = df1, y = df2, by = "CustomerId", all.x = TRUE)</code></p>

<p><strong><em>Right outer:</em></strong> <code>merge(x = df1, y = df2, by = "CustomerId", all.y = TRUE)</code></p>

<p><strong><em>Cross join:</em></strong> <code>merge(x = df1, y = df2, by = NULL)</code></p>

<p><strike>Just as with the inner join, you would probably want to explicitly pass "CustomerId" to R as the matching variable.</strike>  I think it's almost always best to explicitly state the identifiers on which you want to merge; it's safer if the input data.frames change unexpectedly and easier to read later on.</p>

<p>You can merge on multiple columns by giving <code>by</code> a vector, e.g., <code>by = c("CustomerId", "OrderId")</code>. </p>

<p>If the column names to merge on are not the same, you can specify, e.g., <code>by.x = "CustomerId_in_df1", by.y = "CustomerId_in_df2"</code> where <code>CustomerId_in_df1</code> is the name of the column in the first data frame and <code>CustomerId_in_df2</code> is the name of the column in the second data frame. (These can also be vectors if you need to merge on multiple columns.)</p>

<p>There is the <strong>data.table</strong> approach for an inner join, which is very time and memory efficient (and necessary for some larger data.frames):</p>

<p>There are some good examples of doing this over at the <a href="http://wiki.r-project.org/rwiki/doku.php?id=tips:data-frames:merge" rel="noreferrer">R Wiki</a>. I'll steal a couple here:</p>
<p><strong>Merge Method</strong></p>
<p>Since your keys are named the same the short way to do an inner join is merge():</p>
<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">merge<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>df1<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> df2<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>a full inner join (all records from both tables) can be created with the "all" keyword:</p>
<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">merge<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>df1<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> df2<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">all</span><span class="hljs-operator">=</span><span class="hljs-literal">TRUE</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>a left outer join of df1 and df2:</p>
<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">merge<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>df1<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> df2<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> all.x<span class="hljs-operator">=</span><span class="hljs-literal">TRUE</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>a right outer join of df1 and df2:</p>
<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">merge<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>df1<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> df2<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> all.y<span class="hljs-operator">=</span><span class="hljs-literal">TRUE</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>you can flip 'em, slap 'em and rub 'em down to get the other two outer joins you asked about :)</p>
<p><strong>Subscript Method</strong></p>
<p>A left outer join with df1 on the left using a subscript method would be:</p>
<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">df1<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span><span class="hljs-string">"State"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span>df2<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span>df1<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span><span class="hljs-string">"Product"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-string">"State"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The other combination of outer joins can be created by mungling the left outer join subscript example. (yeah, I know that's the equivalent of saying "I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader...")</p>

<p>New in 2014: </p>

<p>Especially if you're also interested in data manipulation in general (including sorting, filtering, subsetting, summarizing etc.), you should definitely take a look at <code>dplyr</code>, which comes with a variety of functions all designed to facilitate your work specifically with data frames and certain other database types. It even offers quite an elaborate SQL interface, and even a function to convert (most) SQL code directly into R.</p>

<p>The four joining-related functions in the dplyr package are (to quote):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>inner_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, ...)</code>: return all rows from
x where there are matching values in y, and all columns from x and y </li>
<li><code>left_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, ...)</code>: return all rows from x, and all columns from x and y </li>
<li><code>semi_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, ...)</code>: return all rows from x where there are matching values in
y, keeping just columns from x.  </li>
<li><code>anti_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, ...)</code>: return all rows from x
where there are not matching values in y, keeping just columns from x</li>
</ul>

<p>It's all <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html" rel="noreferrer">here</a> in great detail.</p>

<p>Selecting columns can be done by <code>select(df,"column")</code>. If that's not SQL-ish enough for you, then there's the <code>sql()</code> function, into which you can enter SQL code as-is, and it will do the operation you specified just like you were writing in R all along (for more information, please refer to the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/databases.html" rel="noreferrer">dplyr/databases vignette</a>). For example, if applied correctly, <code>sql("SELECT * FROM hflights")</code> will select all the columns from the "hflights" dplyr table (a "tbl").</p>

<p>Update on data.table methods for joining datasets. See below examples for each type of join. There are two methods, one from <code>[.data.table</code> when passing second data.table as the first argument to subset, another way is to use <code>merge</code> function which dispatches to fast data.table method.  </p>

<p>Below benchmark tests base R, sqldf, dplyr and data.table.<br>
Benchmark tests unkeyed/unindexed datasets.
Benchmark is performed on 50M-1 rows datasets, there are 50M-2 common values on join column so each scenario (inner, left, right, full) can be tested and join is still not trivial to perform. It is type of join which well stress join algorithms. Timings are as of <code>sqldf:0.4.11</code>, <code>dplyr:0.7.8</code>, <code>data.table:1.12.0</code>.  </p>

<p>dplyr since 0.4 implemented all those joins including <code>outer_join</code>, but it was worth noting that <strong>for the first few releases prior to 0.4 it used not to offer <code>outer_join</code>, and as a result there was a lot of really bad hacky workaround user code floating around for quite a while afterwards (you can still find such code in SO, Kaggle answers, github from that period.

<p>For the case of a left join with a <code>0..*:0..1</code> cardinality or a right join with a <code>0..1:0..*</code> cardinality it is possible to assign in-place the unilateral columns from the joiner (the <code>0..1</code> table) directly onto the joinee (the <code>0..*</code> table), and thereby avoid the creation of an entirely new table of data. This requires matching the key columns from the joinee into the joiner and indexing+ordering the joiner's rows accordingly for the assignment.</p>

<p>If the key is a single column, then we can use a single call to <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/match.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>match()</code></a> to do the matching. This is the case I'll cover in this answer.</p>

<p>Here's an example based on the OP, except I've added an extra row to <code>df2</code> with an id of 7 to test the case of a non-matching key in the joiner. This is effectively <code>df1</code> left join <code>df2</code>:</p>

<p>In the above I hard-coded an assumption that the key column is the first column of both input tables. I would argue that, in general, this is not an unreasonable assumption, since, if you have a data.frame with a key column, it would be strange if it had not been set up as the first column of the data.frame from the outset. And you can always reorder the columns to make it so. An advantageous consequence of this assumption is that the name of the key column does not have to be hard-coded, although I suppose it's just replacing one assumption with another. Concision is another advantage of integer indexing, as well as speed. In the benchmarks below I'll change the implementation to use string name indexing to match the competing implementations.</p>

<p>I think this is a particularly appropriate solution if you have several tables that you want to left join against a single large table. Repeatedly rebuilding the entire table for each merge would be unnecessary and inefficient.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you need the joinee to remain unaltered through this operation for whatever reason, then this solution cannot be used, since it modifies the joinee directly. Although in that case you could simply make a copy and perform the in-place assignment(s) on the copy.</p>

<hr>

<p>As a side note, I briefly looked into possible matching solutions for multicolumn keys. Unfortunately, the only matching solutions I found were:</p>

<ul>
<li>inefficient concatenations. e.g. <code>match(interaction(df1$a,df1$b),interaction(df2$a,df2$b))</code>, or the same idea with <code>paste()</code>.</li>
<li>inefficient cartesian conjunctions, e.g. <code>outer(df1$a,df2$a,`==`) &amp; outer(df1$b,df2$b,`==`)</code>.</li>
<li>base R <code>merge()</code> and equivalent package-based merge functions, which always allocate a new table to return the merged result, and thus are not suitable for an in-place assignment-based solution.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13286881/matching-multiple-columns-on-different-data-frames-and-getting-other-column-as-r">Matching multiple columns on different data frames and getting other column as result</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6880450/match-two-columns-with-two-other-columns">match two columns with two other columns</a>, <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2007-January/123488.html" rel="noreferrer">Matching on multiple columns</a>, and the dupe of this question where I originally came up with the in-place solution, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38066077/combine-two-data-frames-with-different-number-of-rows-in-r/38066281#38066281">Combine two data frames with different number of rows in R</a>.</p>

<h1>Benchmarking</h1>

<p>I decided to do my own benchmarking to see how the in-place assignment approach compares to the other solutions that have been offered in this question.</p>

<p>Here I benchmark on random input data, trying different scales and different patterns of key overlap between the two input tables. This benchmark is still restricted to the case of a single-column integer key. As well, to ensure that the in-place solution would work for both left and right joins of the same tables, all random test data uses <code>0..1:0..1</code> cardinality. This is implemented by sampling without replacement the key column of the first data.frame when generating the key column of the second data.frame.</p>

<p>I wrote some code to create log-log plots of the above results. I generated a separate plot for each overlap percentage. It's a little bit cluttered, but I like having all the solution types and join types represented in the same plot.</p>

<p>I used spline interpolation to show a smooth curve for each solution/join type combination, drawn with individual pch symbols. The join type is captured by the pch symbol, using a dot for inner, left and right angle brackets for left and right, and a diamond for full. The solution type is captured by the color as shown in the legend.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here's a second large-scale benchmark that's more heavy-duty, with respect to the number and types of key columns, as well as cardinality. For this benchmark I use three key columns: one character, one integer, and one logical, with no restrictions on cardinality (that is, <code>0..*:0..*</code>). (In general it's not advisable to define key columns with double or complex values due to floating-point comparison complications, and basically no one ever uses the raw type, much less for key columns, so I haven't included those types in the key columns. Also, for information's sake, I initially tried to use four key columns by including a POSIXct key column, but the POSIXct type didn't play well with the <code>sqldf.indexed</code> solution for some reason, possibly due to floating-point comparison anomalies, so I removed it.)</p>

<p>Suppose we want to add the customer's state from <code>cust</code> to the purchases table, <code>sales</code>, ignoring the year column. With base R, we can identify matching rows and then copy values over:</p>

<p>As can be seen here, <code>match</code> selects the first matching row from the customer table.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update join with multiple columns.</strong> The approach above works well when we are joining on only a single column and are satisfied with the first match. Suppose we want the year of measurement in the customer table to match the year of sale.</p>

<p>As @bgoldst's answer mentions, <code>match</code> with <code>interaction</code> might be an option for this case. More straightforwardly, one could use data.table:</p>

I would argue that, in general, this is not an unreasonable assumption, since, if you have a data.frame with a key column, it would be strange if it had not been set up as the first column of the data.frame from the outset. And you can always reorder the columns to make it so. An advantageous consequence of this assumption is that the name of the key column does not have to be hard-coded, although I suppose it\u0026apos;s just replacing one assumption with another. Concision is another advantage of integer indexing, as well as speed. In the benchmarks below I\u0026apos;ll change the implementation to use string name indexing to match the competing implementations.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I think this is a particularly appropriate solution if you have several tables that you want to left join against a single large table. Repeatedly rebuilding the entire table for each merge would be unnecessary and inefficient.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;On the other hand, if you need the joinee to remain unaltered through this operation for whatever reason, then this solution cannot be used, since it modifies the joinee directly. Although in that case you could simply make a copy and perform the in-place assignment(s) on the copy.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;As a side note, I briefly looked into possible matching solutions for multicolumn keys. Unfortunately, the only matching solutions I found were:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;inefficient concatenations. e.g. \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;match(interaction(df1$a,df1$b),interaction(df2$a,df2$b))\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, or the same idea with \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;paste()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;inefficient cartesian conjunctions, e.g. \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;outer(df1$a,df2$a,`==`) \u0026amp;amp; outer(df1$b,df2$b,`==`)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;base R \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;merge()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and equivalent package-based merge functions, which always allocate a new table to return the merged result, and thus are not suitable for an in-place assignment-based solution.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;For example, see \u0026lt;a

a second large-scale benchmark that\u0026apos;s more heavy-duty, with respect to the number and types of key columns, as well as cardinality. For this benchmark I use three key columns: one character, one integer, and one logical, with no restrictions on cardinality (that is, \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;0..*:0..*\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;). (In general it\u0026apos;s not advisable to define key columns with double or complex values due to floating-point comparison complications, and basically no one ever uses the raw type, much less for key columns, so I haven\u0026apos;t included those types in the key columns. Also, for information\u0026apos;s sake, I initially tried to use four key columns by including a POSIXct key column, but the POSIXct type didn\u0026apos;t play well with the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;sqldf.indexed\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; solution for some reason, possibly due to floating-point comparison anomalies, so I removed it.)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre
