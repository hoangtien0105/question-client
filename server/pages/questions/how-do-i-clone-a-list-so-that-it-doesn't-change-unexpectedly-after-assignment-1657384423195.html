The assignment just copies the reference to the list, not the actual list, so both new_list and my_list refer to the same list after the assignment.\nTo actually copy the list, you have several options:\n\nYou can use the builtin list.copy() method (available since Python 3.3):\n\nnew_list = old_list.copy()\n\n\nYou can slice it:\n\nnew_list = old_list[:]\n\nAlex Martelli&apos;s opinion (at least back in 2007) about this is, that it is a weird syntax and it does not make sense to use it ever. ;) (In his opinion, the next one is more readable).\n\nYou can use the built in list() function:\n\nnew_list = list(old_list)\n\n\nYou can use generic copy.copy():\n\nimport copy\nnew_list = copy.copy(old_list)\n\nThis is a little slower than list() because it has to find out the datatype of old_list first.\n\nIf you need to copy the elements of the list as well, use generic copy.deepcopy():\n\nimport copy\nnew_list = copy.deepcopy(old_list)\n\nObviously the slowest and most memory-needing method, but sometimes unavoidable. This operates recursively; it will handle any number of levels of nested lists (or other containers).\nExample:\nimport copy\n\nclass Foo(object):\n    def __init__(self, val):\n         self.val = val\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f&apos;Foo({self.val!r})&apos;\n\nfoo = Foo(1)\n\na = [&apos;foo&apos;, foo]\nb = a.copy()\nc = a[:]\nd = list(a)\ne = copy.copy(a)\nf = copy.deepcopy(a)\n\n# edit orignal list and instance \na.append(&apos;baz&apos;)\nfoo.val = 5\n\nprint(f&apos;original: {a}\\nlist.copy(): {b}\\nslice: {c}\\nlist(): {d}\\ncopy: {e}\\ndeepcopy: {f}&apos;)\n\nResult:\noriginal: [&apos;foo&apos;, Foo(5), &apos;baz&apos;]\nlist.copy(): [&apos;foo&apos;, Foo(5)]\nslice: [&apos;foo&apos;, Foo(5)]\nlist(): [&apos;foo&apos;, Foo(5)]\ncopy: [&apos;foo&apos;, Foo(5)]\ndeepcopy: [&apos;foo&apos;, Foo(1)]\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Felix already provided an excellent answer, but I thought I&apos;d do a speed comparison of the various methods:\n\n10.59 sec (105.9 µs/itn) -  copy.deepcopy(old_list)\n10.16 sec (101.6 µs/itn) - pure Python Copy() method copying classes with deepcopy\n1.488 sec (14.88 µs/itn) - pure Python Copy() method not copying classes (only dicts/lists/tuples)\n0.325 sec (3.25 µs/itn) - for item in old_list: new_list.append(item)\n0.217 sec (2.17 µs/itn) - [i for i in old_list] (a list comprehension)\n0.186 sec (1.86 µs/itn) - copy.copy(old_list)\n0.075 sec (0.75 µs/itn) - list(old_list)\n0.053 sec (0.53 µs/itn) - new_list = []; new_list.extend(old_list)\n0.039 sec (0.39 µs/itn) - old_list[:] (list slicing)\n\nSo the fastest is list slicing.

A shallow copy creates a new list of the same objects, a deep copy creates a new list containing new equivalent objects.\n\nShallow list copy\n\nA shallow copy only copies the list itself, which is a container of references to the objects in the list. If the objects contained themselves are mutable and one is changed, the change will be reflected in both lists. \n\nThere are different ways to do this in Python 2 and 3. The Python 2 ways will also work in Python 3.\n\nPython 2\n\nIn Python 2, the idiomatic way of making a shallow copy of a list is with a complete slice of the original:\n\na_copy = a_list[:]\n\n\nYou can also accomplish the same thing by passing the list through the list constructor, \n\na_copy = list(a_list)\n\n\nbut using the constructor is less efficient:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; timeit\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l = range(20)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; min(timeit.repeat(lambda: l[:]))\n0.30504298210144043\n&gt;&gt;&gt; min(timeit.repeat(lambda: list(l)))\n0.40698814392089844\n\n\nPython 3\n\nIn Python 3, lists get the list.copy method:\n\na_copy = a_list.copy()\n\n\nIn Python 3.5:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import timeit\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l = list(range(20))\n&gt;&gt;&gt; min(timeit.repeat(lambda: l[:]))\n0.38448613602668047\n&gt;&gt;&gt; min(timeit.repeat(lambda: list(l)))\n0.6309100328944623\n&gt;&gt;&gt; min(timeit.repeat(lambda: l.copy()))\n0.38122922903858125\n\n\nMaking another pointer does not make a copy\n\n\n  Using new_list = my_list then modifies new_list every time my_list changes. Why is this?\n\n\nmy_list is just a name that points to the actual list in memory. When you say new_list = my_list you&apos;re not making a copy, you&apos;re just adding another name that points at that original list in memory. We can have similar issues when we make copies of lists. \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l = [[], [], []]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l_copy = l[:]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l_copy\n[[], [], []]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l_copy[0].append(&apos;foo&apos;)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l_copy\n[[&apos;foo&apos;], [], []]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l\n[[&apos;foo&apos;], [], []]\n\n\nThe list is just an array of pointers to the contents, so a shallow copy just copies the pointers, and so you have two different lists, but they have the same contents. To make copies of the contents, you need a deep copy.\n\nDeep copies\n\nTo make a deep copy of a list, in Python 2 or 3, use deepcopy in the copy module:\n\nimport copy\na_deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(a_list)\n\n\nTo demonstrate how this allows us to make new sub-lists:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import copy\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l\n[[&apos;foo&apos;], [], []]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l_deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(l)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l_deep_copy[0].pop()\n&apos;foo&apos;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l_deep_copy\n[[], [], []]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l\n[[&apos;foo&apos;], [], []]\n\n\nAnd so we see that the deep copied list is an entirely different list from the original. You could roll your own function - but don&apos;t. You&apos;re likely to create bugs you otherwise wouldn&apos;t have by using the standard library&apos;s deepcopy function.\n\nDon&apos;t use eval\n\nYou may see this used as a way to deepcopy, but don&apos;t do it:\n\nproblematic_deep_copy = eval(repr(a_list))\n\n\n\nIt&apos;s dangerous, particularly if you&apos;re evaluating something from a source you don&apos;t trust.\nIt&apos;s not reliable, if a subelement you&apos;re copying doesn&apos;t have a representation that can be eval&apos;d to reproduce an equivalent element.\nIt&apos;s also less performant. \n\n\nIn 64 bit Python 2.7:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import timeit\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import copy\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l = range(10)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; min(timeit.repeat(lambda: copy.deepcopy(l)))\n27.55826997756958\n&gt;&gt;&gt; min(timeit.repeat(lambda: eval(repr(l))))\n29.04534101486206\n\n\non 64 bit Python 3.5:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import timeit\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import copy\n&gt;&gt;&gt; l = list(range(10))\n&gt;&gt;&gt; min(timeit.repeat(lambda: copy.deepcopy(l)))\n16.84255409205798\n&gt;&gt;&gt; min(timeit.repeat(lambda: eval(repr(l))))\n34.813894678023644\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Let&apos;s start from the beginning and explore this question.\nSo let&apos;s suppose you have two lists:\nlist_1 = [&apos;01&apos;, &apos;98&apos;]\nlist_2 = [[&apos;01&apos;, &apos;98&apos;]]\n\nAnd we have to copy both lists, now starting from the first list:\nSo first let&apos;s try by setting the variable copy to our original list, list_1:\ncopy = list_1\n\nNow if you are thinking copy copied the list_1, then you are wrong. The id function can show us if two variables can point to the same object. Let&apos;s try this:\nprint(id(copy))\nprint(id(list_1))\n\nThe output is:\n4329485320\n4329485320\n\nBoth variables are the exact same argument. Are you surprised?\nSo as we know, Python doesn&apos;t store anything in a variable, Variables are just referencing to the object and object store the value. Here object is a list but we created two references to that same object by two different variable names. This means that both variables are pointing to the same object, just with different names.\nWhen you do copy = list_1, it is actually doing:\n\nHere in the image list_1 and copy are two variable names, but the object is same for both variable which is list.\nSo if you try to modify copied list then it will modify the original list too because the list is only one there, you will modify that list no matter you do from the copied list or from the original list:\ncopy[0] = &quot;modify&quot;\n\nprint(copy)\nprint(list_1)\n\nOutput:\n[&apos;modify&apos;, &apos;98&apos;]\n[&apos;modify&apos;, &apos;98&apos;]\n\nSo it modified the original list:\nNow let&apos;s move onto a Pythonic method for copying lists.\ncopy_1 = list_1[:]\n\nThis method fixes the first issue we had:\nprint(id(copy_1))\nprint(id(list_1))\n\n4338792136\n4338791432\n\nSo as we can see our both list having different id and it means that both variables are pointing to different objects. So what actually going on here is:\n\nNow let&apos;s try to modify the list and let&apos;s see if we still face the previous problem:\ncopy_1[0] = &quot;modify&quot;\n\nprint(list_1)\nprint(copy_1)\n\nThe output is:\n[&apos;01&apos;, &apos;98&apos;]\n[&apos;modify&apos;, &apos;98&apos;]\n\nAs you can see, it only modified the copied list. That means it worked.\nDo you think we&apos;re done? No. Let&apos;s try to copy our nested list.\ncopy_2 = list_2[:]\n\nlist_2 should reference to another object which is copy of list_2. Let&apos;s check:\nprint(id((list_2)), id(copy_2))\n\nWe get the output:\n4330403592 4330403528\n\nNow we can assume both lists are pointing different object, so now let&apos;s try to modify it and let&apos;s see it is giving what we want:\ncopy_2[0][1] = &quot;modify&quot;\n\nprint(list_2, copy_2)\n\nThis gives us the output:\n[[&apos;01&apos;, &apos;modify&apos;]] [[&apos;01&apos;, &apos;modify&apos;]]\n\nThis may seem a little bit confusing, because the same method we previously used worked. Let&apos;s try to understand this.\nWhen you do:\ncopy_2 = list_2[:]\n\nYou&apos;re only copying the outer list, not the inside list. We can use the id function once again to check this.\nprint(id(copy_2[0]))\nprint(id(list_2[0]))\n\nThe output is:\n4329485832\n4329485832\n\nWhen we do copy_2 = list_2[:], this happens:\n\nIt creates the copy of list, but only outer list copy, not the nested list copy. The nested list is same for both variable, so if you try to modify the nested list then it will modify the original list too as the nested list object is same for both lists.\nWhat is the solution? The solution is the deepcopy function.\nfrom copy import deepcopy\ndeep = deepcopy(list_2)\n\nLet&apos;s check this:\nprint(id((list_2)), id(deep))\n\n4322146056 4322148040\n\nBoth outer lists have different IDs. Let&apos;s try this on the inner nested lists.\nprint(id(deep[0]))\nprint(id(list_2[0]))\n\nThe output is:\n4322145992\n4322145800\n\nAs you can see both IDs are different, meaning we can assume that both nested lists are pointing different object now.\nThis means when you do deep = deepcopy(list_2) what actually happens:\n\nBoth nested lists are pointing different object and they have separate copy of nested list now.\nNow let&apos;s try to modify the nested list and see if it solved the previous issue or not:\ndeep[0][1] = &quot;modify&quot;\nprint(list_2, deep)\n\nIt outputs:\n[[&apos;01&apos;, &apos;98&apos;]] [[&apos;01&apos;, &apos;modify&apos;]]\n\nAs you can see, it didn&apos;t modify the original nested list, it only modified the copied list.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"There are many answers already that tell you how to make a proper copy, but none of them say why your original &apos;copy&apos; failed. \n\nPython doesn&apos;t store values in variables; it binds names to objects.

Even though this is most likely not the most understandable, or fastest option, it provides a bit of an inside view of how deep copy works, as well as being another alternative option for deep copying. It doesn&apos;t really matter if my function has bugs, since the point of this is to show a way to copy objects like the question answers, but also to use this as a point to explain how deepcopy works at its core.\nAt the core of any deep copy function is way to make a shallow copy. How? Simple. Any deep copy function only duplicates the containers of immutable objects. When you deepcopy a nested list, you are only duplicating the outer lists, not the mutable objects inside of the lists. You are only duplicating the containers. The same works for classes, too. When you deepcopy a class, you deepcopy all of its mutable attributes. So, how? How come you only have to copy the containers, like lists, dicts, tuples, iters, classes, and class instances?\nIt&apos;s simple. A mutable object can&apos;t really be duplicated. It can never be changed, so it is only a single value. That means you never have to duplicate strings, numbers, bools, or any of those. But how would you duplicate the containers? Simple. You make just initialize a new container with all of the values. Deepcopy relies on recursion. It duplicates all the containers, even ones with containers inside of them, until no containers are left. A container is an immutable object.\nOnce you know that, completely duplicating an object without any references is pretty easy. Here&apos;s a function for deepcopying basic data-types (wouldn&apos;t work for custom classes but you could always add that)\ndef deepcopy(x):\n  immutables = (str, int, bool, float)\n  mutables = (list, dict, tuple)\n  if isinstance(x, immutables):\n    return x\n  elif isinstance(x, mutables):\n    if isinstance(x, tuple):\n      return tuple(deepcopy(list(x)))\n    elif isinstance(x, list):\n      return [deepcopy(y) for y in x]\n    elif isinstance(x, dict):\n      values = [deepcopy(y) for y in list(x.values())]\n      keys = list(x.keys())\n      return dict(zip(keys, values))\n\nPython&apos;s own built-in deepcopy is based around that example. The only difference is it supports other types, and also supports user-classes by duplicating the attributes into a new duplicate class, and also blocks infinite-recursion with a reference to an object it&apos;s already seen using a memo list or dictionary. And that&apos;s really it for making deep copies. At its core, making a deep copy is just making shallow copies. I hope this answer adds something to the question.\nEXAMPLES\nSay you have this list: [1, 2, 3]. The immutable numbers cannot be duplicated, but the other layer can. You can duplicate it using a list comprehension: [x for x in [1, 2, 3]]\nNow, imagine you have this list: [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]. This time, you want to make a function, which uses recursion to deep copy all layers of the list. Instead of the previous list comprehension:\n[x for x in _list]\n\nIt uses a new one for lists:\n[deepcopy_list(x) for x in _list]\n\nAnd deepcopy_list looks like this:\ndef deepcopy_list(x):\n  if isinstance(x, (str, bool, float, int)):\n    return x\n  else:\n    return [deepcopy_list(y) for y in x]\n\nThen now you have a function which can deepcopy any list of strs, bools, floast, ints and even lists to infinitely many layers using recursion. And there you have it, deepcopying.\nTLDR: Deepcopy uses recursion to duplicate objects, and merely returns the same immutable objects as before, as immutable objects cannot be duplicated. However, it deepcopies the most inner layers of mutable objects until it reaches the outermost mutable layer of an object.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution14","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Note that there are some cases where if you have defined your own custom class and you want to keep the attributes then you should use copy.copy() or copy.deepcopy() rather than the alternatives, for example in Python 3:\n\nimport copy\n\nclass MyList(list):\n    pass\n\nlst = MyList([1,2,3])\n\nlst.name = &apos;custom list&apos;\n\nd = {\n&apos;original&apos;: lst,\n&apos;slicecopy&apos; : lst[:],\n&apos;lstcopy&apos; : lst.copy(),\n&apos;copycopy&apos;: copy.copy(lst),\n&apos;deepcopy&apos;: copy.deepcopy(lst)\n}\n\n\nfor k,v in d.items():\n    print(&apos;lst: {}&apos;.format(k), end=&apos;, &apos;)\n    try:\n        name = v.name\n    except AttributeError:\n        name = &apos;NA&apos;\n    print(&apos;name: {}&apos;.format(name))\n\n\nOutputs:\n\nlst: original, name: custom list\nlst: slicecopy, name: NA\nlst: lstcopy, name: NA\nlst: copycopy, name: custom list\nlst: deepcopy, name: custom list\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution15","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Remember that in Python when you do:\n\n    list1 = [&apos;apples&apos;,&apos;bananas&apos;,&apos;pineapples&apos;]\n    list2 = list1\n\n\nList2 isn&apos;t storing the actual list, but a reference to list1.

<p><code>new_list = my_list</code> doesn't actually create a second list. The assignment just copies the reference to the list, not the actual list, so both <code>new_list</code> and <code>my_list</code> refer to the same list after the assignment.</p>
<p>To actually copy the list, you have several options:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use the builtin <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#mutable-sequence-types" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>list.copy()</code></a> method (available since Python 3.3):</li>
</ul>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">new_list = old_list.copy()
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>You can slice it:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">new_list = old_list[:]
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Martelli" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Alex Martelli</a>'s opinion (at least <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7V89K8QfgQ" rel="nofollow noreferrer">back in 2007</a>) about this is, that <em>it is a weird syntax and it does not make sense to use it ever</em>. ;) (In his opinion, the next one is more readable).</p>
<ul>
<li>You can use the built in <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#list" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>list()</code></a> function:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">new_list = <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(old_list)
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>You can use generic <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/copy.html#copy.copy" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>copy.copy()</code></a>:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> copy
new_list = copy.copy(old_list)
</code></pre>
<p>This is a little slower than <code>list()</code> because it has to find out the datatype of <code>old_list</code> first.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you need to copy the elements of the list as well, use generic <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/copy.html#copy.deepcopy" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>copy.deepcopy()</code></a>:</li>
</ul>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> copy
new_list = copy.deepcopy(old_list)
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously the slowest and most memory-needing method, but sometimes unavoidable. This operates recursively; it will handle any number of levels of nested lists (or other containers).</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> copy

<span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Foo</span>(<span class="hljs-title class_ inherited__">object</span>):
    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">__init__</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self, val</span>):
         self.val = val

    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">__repr__</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self</span>):
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-string">f'Foo(<span class="hljs-subst">{self.val!r}</span>)'</span>

foo = Foo(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>)

a = [<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>, foo]
b = a.copy()
c = a[:]
d = <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(a)
e = copy.copy(a)
f = copy.deepcopy(a)

<span class="hljs-comment"># edit orignal list and instance </span>
a.append(<span class="hljs-string">'baz'</span>)
foo.val = <span class="hljs-number">5</span>

<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">f'original: <span class="hljs-subst">{a}</span>\nlist.copy(): <span class="hljs-subst">{b}</span>\nslice: <span class="hljs-subst">{c}</span>\nlist(): <span class="hljs-subst">{d}</span>\ncopy: <span class="hljs-subst">{e}</span>\ndeepcopy: <span class="hljs-subst">{f}</span>'</span>)

<p>Felix already provided an excellent answer, but I thought I'd do a speed comparison of the various methods:</p>

<li>10.16 sec (101.6 µs/itn) - pure Python <code>Copy()</code> method copying classes with deepcopy</li>

<li>0.325 sec (3.25 µs/itn) - <code>for item in old_list: new_list.append(item)</code></li>
<li>0.217 sec (2.17 µs/itn) - <code>[i for i in old_list]</code> (a <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions" rel="noreferrer">list comprehension</a>)</li>

</ol>
<p>So the fastest is list slicing. But be aware that <code>copy.copy()</code>, <code>list[:]</code> and <code>list(list)</code>, unlike <code>copy.deepcopy()</code> and the python version don't copy any lists, dictionaries and class instances in the list, so if the originals change, they will change in the copied list too and vice versa.</p>

  <h1>What are the options to clone or copy a list in Python?</h1>
</blockquote>

<p>In Python 3, a shallow copy can be made with:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">a_copy = a_list.copy()
</code></pre>

<p>In Python 2 and 3, you can get a shallow copy with a full slice of the original:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">a_copy = a_list[:]
</code></pre>

<h2>Explanation</h2>

<p>There are two semantic ways to copy a list. A shallow copy creates a new list of the same objects, a deep copy creates a new list containing new equivalent objects.</p>

<h2>Shallow list copy</h2>

<p>A shallow copy only copies the list itself, which is a container of references to the objects in the list. If the objects contained themselves are mutable and one is changed, the change will be reflected in both lists. </p>

<p>There are different ways to do this in Python 2 and 3. The Python 2 ways will also work in Python 3.</p>

<h3>Python 2</h3>

<p>In Python 2, the idiomatic way of making a shallow copy of a list is with a complete slice of the original:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">a_copy = a_list[:]
</code></pre>

<p>You can also accomplish the same thing by passing the list through the list constructor, </p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">a_copy = <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(a_list)
</code></pre>

<p>but using the constructor is less efficient:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>timeit
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l = <span class="hljs-built_in">range</span>(<span class="hljs-number">20</span>)
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-built_in">min</span>(timeit.repeat(<span class="hljs-keyword">lambda</span>: l[:]))
<span class="hljs-number">0.30504298210144043</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-built_in">min</span>(timeit.repeat(<span class="hljs-keyword">lambda</span>: <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(l)))
<span class="hljs-number">0.40698814392089844</span>
</code></pre>

<h3>Python 3</h3>

<p>In Python 3, lists get the <code>list.copy</code> method:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">a_copy = a_list.copy()
</code></pre>

<p>In Python 3.5:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> timeit
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l = <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">range</span>(<span class="hljs-number">20</span>))
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-built_in">min</span>(timeit.repeat(<span class="hljs-keyword">lambda</span>: l[:]))
<span class="hljs-number">0.38448613602668047</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-built_in">min</span>(timeit.repeat(<span class="hljs-keyword">lambda</span>: <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(l)))
<span class="hljs-number">0.6309100328944623</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-built_in">min</span>(timeit.repeat(<span class="hljs-keyword">lambda</span>: l.copy()))
<span class="hljs-number">0.38122922903858125</span>
</code></pre>

<h2>Making another pointer does <em>not</em> make a copy</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Using new_list = my_list then modifies new_list every time my_list changes. Why is this?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>my_list</code> is just a name that points to the actual list in memory. When you say <code>new_list = my_list</code> you're not making a copy, you're just adding another name that points at that original list in memory. We can have similar issues when we make copies of lists. </p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l = [[], [], []]
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l_copy = l[:]
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l_copy
[[], [], []]
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l_copy[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>].append(<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>)
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l_copy
[[<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>], [], []]
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l
[[<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>], [], []]
</code></pre>

<p>The list is just an array of pointers to the contents, so a shallow copy just copies the pointers, and so you have two different lists, but they have the same contents. To make copies of the contents, you need a deep copy.</p>

<h2>Deep copies</h2>

<p>To make a <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/copy.html" rel="noreferrer">deep copy of a list, in Python 2 or 3, use <code>deepcopy</code> in the <code>copy</code> module</a>:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> copy
a_deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(a_list)
</code></pre>

<p>To demonstrate how this allows us to make new sub-lists:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> copy
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l
[[<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>], [], []]
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l_deep_copy = copy.deepcopy(l)
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l_deep_copy[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>].pop()
<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l_deep_copy
[[], [], []]
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>l
[[<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>], [], []]
</code></pre>

<p>And so we see that the deep copied list is an entirely different list from the original. You could roll your own function - but don't. You're likely to create bugs you otherwise wouldn't have by using the standard library's deepcopy function.</p>

<h2>Don't use <code>eval</code></h2>

<p>You may see this used as a way to deepcopy, but don't do it:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">problematic_deep_copy = <span class="hljs-built_in">eval</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">repr</span>(a_list))
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>It's dangerous, particularly if you're evaluating something from a source you don't trust.</li>
<li>It's not reliable, if a subelement you're copying doesn't have a representation that can be eval'd to reproduce an equivalent element.</li>
<li>It's also less performant. </li>
</ol>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> timeit

<p>So first let's try by setting the variable <code>copy</code> to our original list, <code>list_1</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">copy = list_1
</code></pre>
<p>Now if you are thinking copy copied the <em>list_1</em>, then you are wrong. The <code>id</code> function can show us if two variables can point to the same object. Let's try this:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">id</span>(copy))
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">id</span>(list_1))
</code></pre>
<p>The output is:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-number">4329485320</span>
<span class="hljs-number">4329485320</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Both variables are the exact same argument. Are you surprised?</p>
<p>So as we know, Python doesn't store anything in a variable, Variables are just referencing to the object and object store the value. Here object is a <code>list</code> but we created two references to that same object by two different variable names. This means that both variables are pointing to the same object, just with different names.</p>
<p>When you do <code>copy = list_1</code>, it is actually doing:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vNGqw.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/vNGqw.jpg" alt="Enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>Here in the image <em>list_1</em> and <em>copy</em> are two variable names, but the object is same for both variable which is <code>list</code>.</p>
<p>So if you try to modify copied list then it will modify the original list too because the list is only one there, you will modify that list no matter you do from the copied list or from the original list:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">copy[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">"modify"</span>

<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(copy)
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(list_1)
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">[<span class="hljs-string">'modify'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'98'</span>]
[<span class="hljs-string">'modify'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'98'</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>So it modified the original list:</p>
<p>Now let's move onto a Pythonic method for copying lists.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">copy_1 = list_1[:]
</code></pre>
<p>This method fixes the first issue we had:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">id</span>(copy_1))
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">id</span>(list_1))

<span class="hljs-number">4338792136</span>
<span class="hljs-number">4338791432</span>
</code></pre>
<p>So as we can see our both list having different id and it means that both variables are pointing to different objects. So what actually going on here is:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iitLk.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iitLk.jpg" alt="Enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>Now let's try to modify the list and let's see if we still face the previous problem:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">copy_1[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">"modify"</span>

<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(list_1)
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(copy_1)
</code></pre>
<p>The output is:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">[<span class="hljs-string">'01'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'98'</span>]
[<span class="hljs-string">'modify'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'98'</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it only modified the copied list. That means it worked.</p>
<p>Do you think we're done? No. Let's try to copy our nested list.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">copy_2 = list_2[:]
</code></pre>
<p><code>list_2</code> should reference to another object which is copy of <code>list_2</code>. Let's check:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">id</span>((list_2)), <span class="hljs-built_in">id</span>(copy_2))
</code></pre>
<p>We get the output:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-number">4330403592</span> <span class="hljs-number">4330403528</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can assume both lists are pointing different object, so now let's try to modify it and let's see it is giving what we want:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">copy_2[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>][<span class="hljs-number">1</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">"modify"</span>

<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(list_2, copy_2)
</code></pre>
<p>This gives us the output:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">[[<span class="hljs-string">'01'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'modify'</span>]] [[<span class="hljs-string">'01'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'modify'</span>]]
</code></pre>
<p>This may seem a little bit confusing, because the same method we previously used worked. Let's try to understand this.</p>
<p>When you do:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">copy_2 = list_2[:]
</code></pre>
<p>You're only copying the outer list, not the inside list. We can use the <code>id</code> function once again to check this.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">id</span>(copy_2[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]))
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">id</span>(list_2[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]))
</code></pre>
<p>The output is:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-number">4329485832</span>
<span class="hljs-number">4329485832</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When we do <code>copy_2 = list_2[:]</code>, this happens:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3hPti.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/3hPti.jpg" alt="Enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>It creates the copy of list, but only outer list copy, not the nested list copy. The nested list is same for both variable, so if you try to modify the nested list then it will modify the original list too as the nested list object is same for both lists.</p>
<p>What is the solution? The solution is the <code>deepcopy</code> function.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> copy <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> deepcopy
deep = deepcopy(list_2)
</code></pre>
<p>Let's check this:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">id</span>((list_2)), <span class="hljs-built_in">id</span>(deep))

<span class="hljs-number">4322146056</span> <span class="hljs-number">4322148040</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Both outer lists have different IDs. Let's try this on the inner nested lists.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">id</span>(deep[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]))
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">id</span>(list_2[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]))
</code></pre>
<p>The output is:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-number">4322145992</span>
<span class="hljs-number">4322145800</span>
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see both IDs are different, meaning we can assume that both nested lists are pointing different object now.</p>
<p>This means when you do <code>deep = deepcopy(list_2)</code> what actually happens:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O7yoo.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/O7yoo.jpg" alt="Enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>Both nested lists are pointing different object and they have separate copy of nested list now.</p>
<p>Now let's try to modify the nested list and see if it solved the previous issue or not:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">deep[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>][<span class="hljs-number">1</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">"modify"</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(list_2, deep)
</code></pre>
<p>It outputs:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">[[<span class="hljs-string">'01'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'98'</span>]] [[<span class="hljs-string">'01'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'modify'</span>]]
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it didn't modify the original nested list, it only modified the copied list.</p>

<p>There are many answers already that tell you how to make a proper copy, but none of them say why your original 'copy' failed. </p>

<p>Python doesn't store values in variables; it binds names to objects. Your original assignment took the object referred to by <code>my_list</code> and bound it to <code>new_list</code> as well. No matter which name you use there is still only one list, so changes made when referring to it as <code>my_list</code> will persist when referring to it as <code>new_list</code>. Each of the other answers to this question give you different ways of creating a new object to bind to <code>new_list</code>. </p>

<p>Each element of a list acts like a name, in that each element binds non-exclusively to an object. A shallow copy creates a new list whose elements bind to the same objects as before.</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">new_list = <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(my_list)  <span class="hljs-comment"># or my_list[:], but I prefer this syntax</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># is simply a shorter way of:</span>
new_list = [element <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> element <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> my_list]
</code></pre>

<p>To take your list copy one step further, copy each object that your list refers to, and bind those element copies to a new list. </p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> copy  
<span class="hljs-comment"># each element must have __copy__ defined for this...</span>
new_list = [copy.copy(element) <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> element <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> my_list]
</code></pre>

<p>This is not yet a deep copy, because each element of a list may refer to other objects, just like the list is bound to its elements. To recursively copy every element in the list, and then each other object referred to by each element, and so on: perform a deep copy. </p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> copy
<span class="hljs-comment"># each element must have __deepcopy__ defined for this...</span>
new_list = copy.deepcopy(my_list)

<h2>Python 3.6 Timings</h2>
<p>Here are the timing results using Python 3.6.8. Keep in mind these times are relative to one another, not absolute.</p>
<p>I stuck to only doing shallow copies, and also added some new methods that weren't possible in Python&nbsp;2, such as <code>list.copy()</code> (the Python&nbsp;3 <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-ideas/2013-July/022368.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">slice equivalent</a>) and two forms of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43190992/understanding-x-lst">list unpacking</a> (<code>*new_list, = list</code> and <code>new_list = [*list]</code>):</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">METHOD                TIME TAKEN
b = [*a]               <span class="hljs-number">2.75180600000021</span>
b = a * <span class="hljs-number">1</span>              <span class="hljs-number">3.50215399999990</span>
b = a[:]               <span class="hljs-number">3.78278899999986</span>  <span class="hljs-comment"># Python 2 winner (see above)</span>
b = a.copy()           <span class="hljs-number">4.20556500000020</span>  <span class="hljs-comment"># Python 3 "slice equivalent" (see above)</span>
b = []; b.extend(a)    <span class="hljs-number">4.68069800000012</span>
b = a[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>:<span class="hljs-built_in">len</span>(a)]        <span class="hljs-number">6.84498999999959</span>
*b, = a                <span class="hljs-number">7.54031799999984</span>
b = <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(a)            <span class="hljs-number">7.75815899999997</span>
b = [i <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> i <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> a]    <span class="hljs-number">18.4886440000000</span>

  b.append(item)      <span class="hljs-number">35.4729199999997</span>
</code></pre>
<p>We can see the Python 2 winner still does well, but doesn't edge out Python 3 <code>list.copy()</code> by much, especially considering the superior readability of the latter.</p>
<p>The dark horse is the unpacking and repacking method (<code>b = [*a]</code>), which is ~25% faster than raw slicing, and more than twice as fast as the other unpacking method (<code>*b, = a</code>).</p>
<p><code>b = a * 1</code> also does surprisingly well.</p>
<p><strong>Note that these methods do <em>not</em> output equivalent results for any input other than lists.</strong> They all work for sliceable objects, a few work for any iterable, but only <code>copy.copy()</code> works for more general Python objects.</p>

<p>All of the other contributors gave <strong>great</strong> answers, which work when you have a single dimension (leveled) list, however of the methods mentioned so far, only <code>copy.deepcopy()</code> works to clone/copy a list and not have it point to the nested <code>list</code> objects when you are working with multidimensional, nested lists (list of lists). While <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/218196/felix-kling">Felix Kling</a> refers to it in his answer, there is a little bit more to the issue and possibly a workaround using built-ins that might prove a faster alternative to <code>deepcopy</code>.</p>
<p>While <code>new_list = old_list[:]</code>, <code>copy.copy(old_list)'</code> and for Py3k <code>old_list.copy()</code> work for single-leveled lists, they revert to pointing at the <code>list</code> objects nested within the <code>old_list</code> and the <code>new_list</code>, and changes to one of the <code>list</code> objects are perpetuated in the other.</p>
<h1>Edit: New information brought to light</h1>

<p>As was pointed out by both <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/541136/aaron-hall">Aaron Hall</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/4014959/pm-2ring">PM 2Ring</a> <strong>using <code>eval()</code> is not only a bad idea, it is also much slower than <code>copy.deepcopy()</code>.</strong></p>
<p>This means that for multidimensional lists, the only option is <code>copy.deepcopy()</code>. With that being said, it really isn't an option as the performance goes way south when you try to use it on a moderately sized multidimensional array.  I tried to <code>timeit</code> using a 42x42 array, not unheard of or even that large for bioinformatics applications, and I gave up on waiting for a response and just started typing my edit to this post.</p>
<p>It would seem that the only real option then is to initialize multiple lists and work on them independently. If anyone has any other suggestions, for how to handle multidimensional list copying, it would be appreciated.</p>

<p>It surprises me that this hasn't been mentioned yet, so for the sake of completeness...</p>

<p>You can perform list unpacking with the "splat operator": <code>*</code>, which will also copy elements of your list.</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">old_list = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>]

new_list = [*old_list]

new_list.append(<span class="hljs-number">4</span>)
old_list == [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>]
new_list == [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">4</span>]
</code></pre>

<p>The obvious downside to this method is that it is only available in Python 3.5+.</p>

<p>Timing wise though, this appears to perform better than other common methods.</p>

<p>Try to understand this. Let's say that <em>my_list</em> is in the heap memory at location X, i.e., <em>my_list</em> is pointing to the X. Now by assigning <code>new_list = my_list</code> you're letting <em>new_list</em> point to the X. This is known as a <em>shallow copy</em>.</p>
<p>Now if you assign <code>new_list = my_list[:]</code>, you're simply copying each object of <em>my_list</em> to <em>new_list</em>. This is known as a <em>deep copy</em>.</p>

<p>A very simple approach independent of python version was missing in already-given answers which you can use most of the time (at least I do):</p>

<p>I wanted to post something a bit different than some of the other answers. Even though this is most likely not the most understandable, or fastest option, it provides a bit of an inside view of how deep copy works, as well as being another alternative option for deep copying. It doesn't really matter if my function has bugs, since the point of this is to show a way to copy objects like the question answers, but also to use this as a point to explain how deepcopy works at its core.</p>
<p>At the core of any deep copy function is way to make a shallow copy. How? Simple. Any deep copy function only duplicates the containers of immutable objects. When you deepcopy a nested list, you are only duplicating the outer lists, not the mutable objects inside of the lists. You are only duplicating the containers. The same works for classes, too. When you deepcopy a class, you deepcopy all of its mutable attributes. So, how? How come you only have to copy the containers, like lists, dicts, tuples, iters, classes, and class instances?</p>
<p>It's simple. A mutable object can't really be duplicated. It can never be changed, so it is only a single value. That means you never have to duplicate strings, numbers, bools, or any of those. But how would you duplicate the containers? Simple. You make just initialize a new container with all of the values. Deepcopy relies on recursion. It duplicates all the containers, even ones with containers inside of them, until no containers are left. A container is an immutable object.</p>
<p>Once you know that, completely duplicating an object without any references is pretty easy. Here's a function for deepcopying basic data-types (wouldn't work for custom classes but you could always add that)</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">deepcopy</span>(<span class="hljs-params">x</span>):

      values = [deepcopy(y) <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> y <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(x.values())]

</code></pre>
<p>Python's own built-in deepcopy is based around that example. The only difference is it supports other types, and also supports user-classes by duplicating the attributes into a new duplicate class, and also blocks infinite-recursion with a reference to an object it's already seen using a memo list or dictionary. And that's really it for making deep copies. At its core, making a deep copy is just making shallow copies. I hope this answer adds something to the question.</p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<p>Say you have this list: <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>. The immutable numbers cannot be duplicated, but the other layer can. You can duplicate it using a list comprehension: <code>[x for x in [1, 2, 3]]</code></p>
<p>Now, imagine you have this list: <code>[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]</code>. This time, you want to make a function, which uses recursion to deep copy all layers of the list. Instead of the previous list comprehension:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">[x <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> x <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> _<span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>It uses a new one for lists:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">[deepcopy_list(x) <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> x <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> _<span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>And <strong>deepcopy_list</strong> looks like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">deepcopy_list</span>(<span class="hljs-params">x</span>):
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">isinstance</span>(x, (<span class="hljs-built_in">str</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">bool</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">float</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>)):
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> x
  <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> [deepcopy_list(y) <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> y <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> x]
</code></pre>
<p>Then now you have a function which can deepcopy any list of <strong>strs, bools, floast, ints</strong> and even <strong>lists</strong> to infinitely many layers using recursion. And there you have it, deepcopying.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: Deepcopy uses recursion to duplicate objects, and merely returns the same immutable objects as before, as immutable objects cannot be duplicated. However, it deepcopies the most inner layers of mutable objects until it reaches the outermost mutable layer of an object.</p>

<p>List2 isn't storing the actual list, but a reference to list1. So when you do anything to list1, list2 changes as well. use the copy module (not default, download on pip) to make an original copy of the list(<code>copy.copy()</code> for simple lists, <code>copy.deepcopy()</code> for nested ones). This makes a copy that doesn't change with the first list.</p>

Even though this is most likely not the most understandable, or fastest option, it provides a bit of an inside view of how deep copy works, as well as being another alternative option for deep copying. It doesn\u0026apos;t really matter if my function has bugs, since the point of this is to show a way to copy objects like the question answers, but also to use this as a point to explain how deepcopy works at its core.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;At the core of any deep copy function is way to make a shallow copy. How? Simple. Any deep copy function only duplicates the containers of immutable objects. When you deepcopy a nested list, you are only duplicating the outer lists, not the mutable objects inside of the lists. You are only duplicating the containers. The same works for classes, too. When you deepcopy a class, you deepcopy all of its mutable attributes. So, how? How come you only have to copy the containers, like lists, dicts, tuples, iters, classes, and class instances?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;It\u0026apos;s simple. A mutable object can\u0026apos;t really be duplicated. It can never be changed, so it is only a single value. That means you never have to duplicate strings, numbers, bools, or any of those. But how would you duplicate the containers? Simple. You make just initialize a new container with all of the values. Deepcopy relies on recursion. It duplicates all the containers, even ones with containers inside of them, until no containers are left. A container is an immutable object.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Once you know that, completely duplicating an object without any references is pretty easy. Here\u0026apos;s a function for deepcopying basic data-types (wouldn\u0026apos;t work for custom classes but you could always add that)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-py s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-python\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;def\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;deepcopy\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-params\u0026quot;\u0026gt;x\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;):\n  immutables = (\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;str\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;int\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;bool\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;float\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;)\n  mutables = (\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;list\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;dict\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;tuple\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;)\n  \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;if\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;isinstance\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(x, immutables):\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;return\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; x\n  \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;elif\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;isinstance\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(x, mutables):\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;if\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;isinstance\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(x, \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;tuple\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;):\n      \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;return\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;tuple\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(deepcopy(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;list\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(x)))\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;elif\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;isinstance\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(x, \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;list\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;):\n      \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;return\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; [deepcopy(y) \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;for\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; y \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;in\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; x]\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;elif\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;isinstance\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(x, \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;dict\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;):\n      values = [deepcopy(y) \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;for\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; y \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;in\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;list\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(x.values())]\n      keys = \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;list\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(x.keys())\n      \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;return\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;dict\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;zip\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(keys, values))\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Python\u0026apos;s own built-in deepcopy is based around that example.
