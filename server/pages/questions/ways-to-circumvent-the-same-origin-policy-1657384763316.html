The same origin policy

I wanted to make a community wiki regarding HTML/JS same-origin policies to hopefully help anyone searching for this topic. This is one of the most searched-for topics on SO and there is no consolidated wiki for it so here I go :)


  The same origin policy prevents a
  document or script loaded from one
  origin from getting or setting
  properties of a document from another
  origin. This policy dates all the way
  back to Netscape Navigator 2.0.


What are some of your favorite ways to go around same-origin policies?

Please keep examples verbose and preferably also link your sources.

If it does so, the shorter domain is used for subsequent origin checks. For example, assume a script in the document at http://store.company.com/dir/other.html executes the following statement:\n\ndocument.domain = &quot;company.com&quot;;\n\n\nAfter that statement executes, the page would pass the origin check with http://company.com/dir/page.html. However, by the same reasoning, company.com could not set document.domain  to othercompany.com.\n\nWith this method, you would be allowed to exectue javascript from an iframe sourced on a subdomain on a page sourced on the main domain. This method is not suited for cross-domain resources as browsers like Firefox will not allow you to change the document.domain to a completely alien domain.\n\nSource: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript\n\nThe Cross-Origin Resource Sharing method\n\n\nMethod type: AJAX.\n\n\nCross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a W3C Working Draft that defines how the browser and server must communicate when accessing sources across origins. The basic idea behind CORS is to use custom HTTP headers to allow both the browser and the server to know enough about each other to determine if the request or response should succeed or fail.\n\nFor a simple request, one that uses either GET or POST with no custom headers and whose body is text/plain, the request is sent with an extra header called Origin. The Origin  header contains the origin (protocol, domain name, and port) of the requesting page so that the server can easily determine whether or not it should serve a response. An example Origin header might look like this:\n\nOrigin: http://www.stackoverflow.com\n\n\nIf the server decides that the request should be allowed, it sends a Access-Control-Allow-Origin header echoing back the same origin that was sent or * if its a public resource. For example:\n\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.stackoverflow.com\n\n\nIf this header is missing, or the origins dont match, then the browser disallows the request. If all is well, then the browser processes the request. Note that neither the requests nor responses include cookie information.\n\nThe Mozilla team suggests in their post about CORS that you should check for the existence of the withCredentials  property to determine if the browser supports CORS via XHR. You can then couple with the existence of the XDomainRequest object to cover all browsers:\n\nfunction createCORSRequest(method, url){\n    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    if (&quot;withCredentials&quot; in xhr){\n        xhr.open(method, url, true);\n    } else if (typeof XDomainRequest != &quot;undefined&quot;){\n        xhr = new XDomainRequest();\n        xhr.open(method, url);\n    } else {\n        xhr = null;\n    }\n    return xhr;\n}\n\nvar request = createCORSRequest(&quot;get&quot;, &quot;http://www.stackoverflow.com/&quot;);\nif (request){\n    request.onload = function() {\n        // ...\n    };\n    request.onreadystatechange = handler;\n    request.send();\n}\n\n\nNote that for the CORS method to work, you need to have access to any type of server header mechanic and can&apos;t simply access any third-party resource.\n\nSource: http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/05/25/cross-domain-ajax-with-cross-origin-resource-sharing/\n\nThe window.postMessage method\n\n\nMethod type: iframe.\n\n\nwindow.postMessage, when called, causes a MessageEvent to be dispatched at the target window when any pending script that must be executed completes (e.g. remaining event handlers if window.postMessage is called from an event handler, previously-set pending timeouts, etc.). The MessageEvent has the type message, a data property which is set to the string value of the first argument provided to window.postMessage, an origin property corresponding to the origin of the main document in the window calling window.postMessage at the time window.postMessage was called, and a source property which is the window from which window.postMessage is called.\n\nTo use window.postMessage, an event listener must be attached:\n\n    // Internet Explorer\n    window.attachEvent(&apos;onmessage&apos;,receiveMessage);\n\n    // Opera/Mozilla/Webkit\n    window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;, receiveMessage, false);\n\n\nAnd a receiveMessage function must be declared:\n\nfunction receiveMessage(event)\n{\n    // do something with event.data;\n}\n\n\nThe off-site iframe must also send events properly via postMessage:\n\n&lt;script&gt;window.parent.postMessage(&apos;foo&apos;,&apos;*&apos;)&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\nAny window may access this method on any other window, at any time, regardless of the location of the document in the window, to send it a message. Consequently, any event listener used to receive messages must  first check the identity of the sender of the message, using the origin  and possibly source properties. This cannot be understated: Failure to check the origin and possibly source properties enables cross-site scripting attacks.\n\nSource: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.postMessage\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"The Reverse Proxy method\n\n\nMethod type: Ajax\n\n\nSetting up a simple reverse proxy on the server, will allow the browser to use relative paths for the Ajax requests, while the server would be acting as a proxy to any remote location. \n\nIf using mod_proxy in Apache, the fundamental configuration directive to set up a reverse proxy is the ProxyPass. It is typically used as follows:\n\nProxyPass     /ajax/     http://other-domain.com/ajax/\n\n\nIn this case, the browser would be able to request /ajax/web_service.xml as a relative URL, but the server would serve this by acting as a proxy to http://other-domain.com/ajax/web_service.xml. \n\nOne interesting feature of the this method is that the reverse proxy can easily distribute requests towards multiple back-ends, thus acting as a load balancer. \n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I use JSONP.\n\nBasically, you add\n\n&lt;script src=&quot;http://..../someData.js?callback=some_func&quot;/&gt;\n\n\non your page.\n\nsome_func() should get called so that you are notified that the data is in.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"AnyOrigin didn&apos;t function well with some https sites, so I just wrote an open source alternative called whateverorigin.org that seems to work well with https.\n\nCode on github.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"The most recent way of overcoming the same-origin policy that I&apos;ve found is http://anyorigin.com/\n\nThe site&apos;s made so that you just give it any url and it generates javascript/jquery code for you that lets you get the html/data, regardless of it&apos;s origin.

<h2>The <code>document.domain</code> method</h2>

<ul>
<li>Method type: <strong>iframe</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this is an iframe method that sets the value of document.domain to a suffix of the current domain. If it does so, the shorter domain is used for subsequent origin checks. For example, assume a script in the document at <code>http://store.company.com/dir/other.html</code> executes the following statement:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-property">domain</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"company.com"</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>After that statement executes, the page would pass the origin check with <code>http://company.com/dir/page.html</code>. However, by the same reasoning, company.com could not set <code>document.domain</code>  to <code>othercompany.com</code>.</p>

<p>With this method, you would be allowed to exectue javascript from an iframe sourced on a subdomain on a page sourced on the main domain. This method is not suited for cross-domain resources as browsers like Firefox will not allow you to change the <code>document.domain</code> to a completely alien domain.</p>

<h2>The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing method</h2>

<ul>
<li>Method type: <strong>AJAX</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/access-control/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a> (CORS) is a W3C Working Draft that defines how the browser and server must communicate when accessing sources across origins. The basic idea behind CORS is to use custom HTTP headers to allow both the browser and the server to know enough about each other to determine if the request or response should succeed or fail.</p>

<p>For a simple request, one that uses either <code>GET</code> or <code>POST</code> with no custom headers and whose body is <code>text/plain</code>, the request is sent with an extra header called <code>Origin</code>. The Origin  header contains the origin (protocol, domain name, and port) of the requesting page so that the server can easily determine whether or not it should serve a response. An example <code>Origin</code> header might look like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title class_">Origin</span>: <span class="hljs-attr">http</span>:<span class="hljs-comment">//www.stackoverflow.com</span>
</code></pre>

<p>If the server decides that the request should be allowed, it sends a <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header echoing back the same origin that was sent or <code>*</code> if its a public resource. For example:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title class_">Access</span>-<span class="hljs-title class_">Control</span>-<span class="hljs-title class_">Allow</span>-<span class="hljs-title class_">Origin</span>: <span class="hljs-attr">http</span>:<span class="hljs-comment">//www.stackoverflow.com</span>
</code></pre>

<p>If this header is missing, or the origins dont match, then the browser disallows the request. If all is well, then the browser processes the request. Note that neither the requests nor responses include cookie information.</p>

<p>The Mozilla team suggests in <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/cross-site-xmlhttprequest-with-cors/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">their post about CORS</a> that you should check for the existence of the <code>withCredentials</code>  property to determine if the browser supports CORS via XHR. You can then couple with the existence of the <code>XDomainRequest</code> object to cover all browsers:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">createCORSRequest</span>(<span class="hljs-params">method, url</span>){
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> xhr = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">XMLHttpRequest</span>();
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-string">"withCredentials"</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> xhr){
        xhr.<span class="hljs-title function_">open</span>(method, url, <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>);
    } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">XDomainRequest</span> != <span class="hljs-string">"undefined"</span>){
        xhr = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">XDomainRequest</span>();
        xhr.<span class="hljs-title function_">open</span>(method, url);
    } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
        xhr = <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>;
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> xhr;
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> request = <span class="hljs-title function_">createCORSRequest</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"get"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"http://www.stackoverflow.com/"</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (request){
    request.<span class="hljs-property">onload</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
        <span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
    };
    request.<span class="hljs-property">onreadystatechange</span> = handler;
    request.<span class="hljs-title function_">send</span>();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that for the CORS method to work, you need to have access to any type of server header mechanic and can't simply access any third-party resource.</p>

<h2>The <code>window.postMessage</code> method</h2>

<ul>
<li>Method type: <strong>iframe</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><code>window.postMessage</code>, when called, causes a <code>MessageEvent</code> to be dispatched at the target window when any pending script that must be executed completes (e.g. remaining event handlers if <code>window.postMessage</code> is called from an event handler, previously-set pending timeouts, etc.). The <code>MessageEvent</code> has the type message, a <code>data</code> property which is set to the string value of the first argument provided to <code>window.postMessage</code>, an <code>origin</code> property corresponding to the origin of the main document in the window calling <code>window.postMessage</code> at the time <code>window.postMessage</code> was called, and a <code>source</code> property which is the window from which <code>window.postMessage</code> is called.</p>

<p>To use <code>window.postMessage</code>, an event listener must be attached:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">    <span class="hljs-comment">// Internet Explorer</span>
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">window</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">attachEvent</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'onmessage'</span>,receiveMessage);

    <span class="hljs-comment">// Opera/Mozilla/Webkit</span>
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">window</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">addEventListener</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"message"</span>, receiveMessage, <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>And a <code>receiveMessage</code> function must be declared:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">receiveMessage</span>(<span class="hljs-params">event</span>)
{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// do something with event.data;</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>The off-site iframe must also send events properly via <code>postMessage</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;script&gt;<span class="hljs-variable language_">window</span>.<span class="hljs-property">parent</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">postMessage</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'*'</span>)&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Any window may access this method on any other window, at any time, regardless of the location of the document in the window, to send it a message. Consequently, any event listener used to receive messages must  first check the identity of the sender of the message, using the origin  and possibly source properties. This cannot be understated: <strong>Failure to check the <code>origin</code> and possibly <code>source</code> properties enables cross-site scripting attacks.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>The Reverse Proxy method</strong></h2>

<ul>
<li>Method type: <strong>Ajax</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Setting up a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reverse proxy</a> on the server, will allow the browser to use relative paths for the Ajax requests, while the server would be acting as a proxy to any remote location. </p>

<p>If using <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">mod_proxy</a> in Apache, the fundamental configuration directive to set up a reverse proxy is the <code>ProxyPass</code>. It is typically used as follows:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title class_">ProxyPass</span>     /ajax/     <span class="hljs-attr">http</span>:<span class="hljs-comment">//other-domain.com/ajax/</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the browser would be able to request <code>/ajax/web_service.xml</code> as a relative URL, but the server would serve this by acting as a proxy to <code>http://other-domain.com/ajax/web_service.xml</code>. </p>

<p>One interesting feature of the this method is that the reverse proxy can easily distribute requests towards multiple back-ends, thus acting as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">load balancer</a>. </p>

<p>The most recent way of overcoming the same-origin policy that I've found is <a href="http://anyorigin.com/">http://anyorigin.com/</a></p>

<p>The site's made so that you just give it any url and it generates javascript/jquery code for you that lets you get the html/data, regardless of it's origin.  In other words, it makes any url or webpage a JSONP request.</p>

<p>I've found it pretty useful :)</p>

<p>Here's some example javascript code from anyorigin:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$.<span class="hljs-title function_">getJSON</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'http://anyorigin.com/get?url=google.com&amp;callback=?'</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">data</span>){

  <p>JSONP or "JSON with padding" is a

  format, a usage pattern that allows a
  page to request and more meaningfully
  use JSON from a server other than the

<p>Personally, <code>window.postMessage</code> is the most reliable way that I've found for modern browsers. You do have to do a slight bit more work to make sure you're not leaving yourself open to XSS attacks, but it's a reasonable tradeoff.</p>

The basic idea behind CORS is to use custom HTTP headers to allow both the browser and the server to know enough about each other to determine if the request or response should succeed or fail.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;For a simple request, one that uses either \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;GET\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;POST\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; with no custom headers and whose body is \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;text/plain\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, the request is sent with an extra header called \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Origin\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. The Origin  header contains the origin (protocol, domain name, and port) of the requesting page so that the server can easily determine whether or not it should serve a response. An example \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Origin\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; header might look like this:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-js s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title class_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Origin\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;: \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-attr\u0026quot;\u0026gt;http\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-comment\u0026quot;\u0026gt;//www.stackoverflow.com\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If the server decides that the request should be allowed, it sends a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Access-Control-Allow-Origin\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; header echoing back the same origin that was sent or \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;*\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; if its a public resource. For example:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-js s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title class_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Access\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title class_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Control\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title class_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Allow\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title class_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Origin\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;: \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-attr\u0026quot;\u0026gt;http\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-comment\u0026quot;\u0026gt;//www.stackoverflow.com\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If this header is missing, or the origins dont match, then the browser disallows the request.
