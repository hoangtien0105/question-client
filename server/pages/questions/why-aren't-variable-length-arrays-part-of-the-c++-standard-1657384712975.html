When I read this question today I came across some C syntax which I wasn&#x27;t familiar with.

Apparently in C99 the following syntax is valid:

void foo(int n) {
    int values[n]; //Declare a variable length array
}


This seems like a pretty useful feature. Was there ever a discussion about adding it to the C++ standard, and if so, why it was omitted?

Some potential reasons:


Hairy for compiler vendors to implement
Incompatible with some other part of the standard
Functionality can be emulated with other C++ constructs


The C++ standard states that array size must be a constant expression (8.3.4.1).

Yes, of course I realize that in the toy example one could use std::vector&lt;int&gt; values(m);, but this allocates memory from the heap and not the stack. And if I want a multidimensional array like:

void foo(int x, int y, int z) {
    int values[x][y][z]; // Declare a variable length array
}


the vector version becomes pretty clumsy:

void foo(int x, int y, int z) {
    vector&lt; vector&lt; vector&lt;int&gt; &gt; &gt; values( /* Really painful expression here. */);
}


The slices, rows and columns will also potentially be spread all over memory.

Looking at the discussion at comp.std.c++ it&#x27;s clear that this question is pretty controversial with some very heavyweight names on both sides of the argument. It&#x27;s certainly not obvious that a std::vector is always a better solution.

It&apos;s certainly not obvious that a std::vector is always a better solution.\n    ","answerCount":13,"upVoteCount":500,"suggestedAnswer":[{"text":"(Background: I have some experience implementing C and C++ compilers.)\n\nVariable-length arrays in C99 were basically a misstep. In order to support VLAs, C99 had to make the following concessions to common sense:\n\n\nsizeof x is no longer always a compile-time constant; the compiler must sometimes generate code to evaluate a sizeof-expression at runtime.\nAllowing two-dimensional VLAs (int A[x][y]) required a new syntax for declaring functions that take 2D VLAs as parameters: void foo(int n, int A[][*]).\nLess importantly in the C++ world, but extremely important for C&apos;s target audience of embedded-systems programmers, declaring a VLA means chomping an arbitrarily large chunk of your stack. This is a guaranteed stack-overflow and crash. (Anytime you declare int A[n], you&apos;re implicitly asserting that you have 2GB of stack to spare. After all, if you know &quot;n is definitely less than 1000 here&quot;, then you would just declare int A[1000]. Substituting the 32-bit integer n for 1000 is an admission that you have no idea what the behavior of your program ought to be.)\n\n\nOkay, so let&apos;s move to talking about C++ now. In C++, we have the same strong distinction between &quot;type system&quot; and &quot;value system&quot; that C89 does but we&apos;ve really started to rely on it in ways that C has not. For example:\n\ntemplate&lt;typename T&gt; struct S { ... };\nint A[n];\nS&lt;decltype(A)&gt; s;  // equivalently, S&lt;int[n]&gt; s;\n\n\nIf n weren&apos;t a compile-time constant (i.e., if A were of variably modified type), then what on earth would be the type of S? Would S&apos;s type also be determined only at runtime?\n\nWhat about this:\n\ntemplate&lt;typename T&gt; bool myfunc(T&amp; t1, T&amp; t2) { ... };\nint A1[n1], A2[n2];\nmyfunc(A1, A2);\n\n\nThe compiler must generate code for some instantiation of myfunc. What should that code look like? How can we statically generate that code, if we don&apos;t know the type of A1 at compile time?\n\nWorse, what if it turns out at runtime that n1 != n2, so that !std::is_same&lt;decltype(A1), decltype(A2)&gt;()? In that case, the call to myfunc shouldn&apos;t even compile, because template type deduction should fail! How could we possibly emulate that behavior at runtime?\n\nBasically, C++ is moving in the direction of pushing more and more decisions into compile-time: template code generation, constexpr function evaluation, and so on. Meanwhile, C99 was busy pushing traditionally compile-time decisions (e.g. sizeof) into the runtime. With this in mind, does it really even make sense to expend any effort trying to integrate C99-style VLAs into C++?\n\nAs every other answerer has already pointed out, C++ provides lots of heap-allocation mechanisms (std::unique_ptr&lt;int[]&gt; A = new int[n]; or std::vector&lt;int&gt; A(n); being the obvious ones) when you really want to convey the idea &quot;I have no idea how much RAM I might need.&quot; And C++ provides a nifty exception-handling model for dealing with the inevitable situation that the amount of RAM you need is greater than the amount of RAM you have. But hopefully this answer gives you a good idea of why C99-style VLAs were not a good fit for C++  and not really even a good fit for C99. ;)\n\n\n\nFor more on the topic, see N3810 &quot;Alternatives for Array Extensions&quot;, Bjarne Stroustrup&apos;s October 2013 paper on VLAs. Bjarne&apos;s POV is very different from mine; N3810 focuses more on finding a good C++ish syntax for the things, and on discouraging the use of raw arrays in C++, whereas I focused more on the implications for metaprogramming and the typesystem. I don&apos;t know if he considers the metaprogramming/typesystem implications solved, solvable, or merely uninteresting.\n\n\n\nA good blog post that hits many of these same points is &quot;Legitimate Use of Variable Length Arrays&quot; (Chris Wellons, 2019-10-27).\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"There recently was a discussion about this kicked off in usenet: Why no VLAs in C++0x. \n\nI agree with those people that seem to agree that having to create a potential large array on the stack, which usually has only little space available, isn&apos;t good. The argument is, if you know the size beforehand, you can use a static array. And if you don&apos;t know the size beforehand, you will write unsafe code. \n\nC99 VLAs could provide a small benefit of being able to create small arrays without wasting space or calling constructors for unused elements, but they will introduce rather large changes to the type system (you need to be able to specify types depending on runtime values - this does not yet exist in current C++, except for new operator type-specifiers, but they are treated specially, so that the runtime-ness doesn&apos;t escape the scope of the new operator).\n\nYou can use std::vector, but it is not quite the same, as it uses dynamic memory, and making it use one&apos;s own stack-allocator isn&apos;t exactly easy (alignment is an issue, too). It also doesn&apos;t solve the same problem, because a vector is a resizable container, whereas VLAs are fixed-size. The C++ Dynamic Array proposal is intended to introduce a library based solution, as alternative to a language based VLA.

So I have a per-thread object that owns some memory from which it can push/pop variable sized buffers.  On some platforms I allow this to grow via mmu.  Other platforms have a fixed size (usually accompanied by a fixed size cpu stack as well because no mmu).  One platform I work with (a handheld game console) has precious little cpu stack anyway because it resides in scarce, fast memory.\n\nI&apos;m not saying that pushing variable-sized buffers onto the cpu stack is never needed.  Honestly I was surprised back when I discovered this wasn&apos;t standard, as it certainly seems like the concept fits into the language well enough.  For me though, the requirements &quot;variable size&quot; and &quot;must be physically located on the cpu stack&quot; have never come up together.

On the other hand, as C++ is arguably the most runtime efficient programming language features which makes it more so are always useful: People who write performance critical programs will to a large extent use C++, and they need as much performance as possible. Moving stuff from heap to stack is one such possibility. Reducing the number of heap blocks is another. Allowing VLAs as object members would one way to achieve this.

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-type">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">foo</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-type">int</span> x, <span class="hljs-type">int</span> y, <span class="hljs-type">int</span> z)</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-type">int</span> values[x][y][z]; <span class="hljs-comment">// Declare a variable length array</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>the <code>vector</code> version becomes pretty clumsy:</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-type">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">foo</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-type">int</span> x, <span class="hljs-type">int</span> y, <span class="hljs-type">int</span> z)</span> </span>{
    vector&lt; vector&lt; vector&lt;<span class="hljs-type">int</span>&gt; &gt; &gt; <span class="hljs-built_in">values</span>( <span class="hljs-comment">/* Really painful expression here. */</span>);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The slices, rows and columns will also potentially be spread all over memory.</p>

<p>Looking at the discussion at <code>comp.std.c++</code> it's clear that this question is pretty controversial with some very heavyweight names on both sides of the argument. It's certainly not obvious that a <code>std::vector</code> is always a better solution.</p>

<p>(Background: I have some experience implementing C and C++ compilers.)</p>

<p>Variable-length arrays in C99 were basically a misstep. In order to support VLAs, C99 had to make the following concessions to common sense:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>sizeof x</code> is no longer always a compile-time constant; the compiler must sometimes generate code to evaluate a <code>sizeof</code>-expression at runtime.</p></li>
<li><p>Allowing two-dimensional VLAs (<code>int A[x][y]</code>) required a new syntax for declaring functions that take 2D VLAs as parameters: <code>void foo(int n, int A[][*])</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Less importantly in the C++ world, but extremely important for C's target audience of embedded-systems programmers, declaring a VLA means chomping an <em>arbitrarily large</em> chunk of your stack. This is a <em>guaranteed</em> stack-overflow and crash. (Anytime you declare <code>int A[n]</code>, you're implicitly asserting that you have 2GB of stack to spare. After all, if you know "<code>n</code> is definitely less than 1000 here", then you would just declare <code>int A[1000]</code>. Substituting the 32-bit integer <code>n</code> for <code>1000</code> is an admission that you have no idea what the behavior of your program ought to be.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, so let's move to talking about C++ now. In C++, we have the same strong distinction between "type system" and "value system" that C89 does but we've really started to rely on it in ways that C has not. For example:</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-keyword">template</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">typename</span> T&gt; <span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">S</span> { ... };
<span class="hljs-type">int</span> A[n];
S&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">decltype</span>(A)&gt; s;  <span class="hljs-comment">// equivalently, S&lt;int[n]&gt; s;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>n</code> weren't a compile-time constant (i.e., if <code>A</code> were of variably modified type), then what on earth would be the type of <code>S</code>? Would <code>S</code>'s type <em>also</em> be determined only at runtime?</p>

<p>What about this:</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">template</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">typename</span> T&gt; <span class="hljs-type">bool</span> <span class="hljs-title">myfunc</span><span class="hljs-params">(T&amp; t1, T&amp; t2)</span> </span>{ ... };
<span class="hljs-type">int</span> A1[n1], A2[n2];
<span class="hljs-built_in">myfunc</span>(A1, A2);
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler must generate code for some instantiation of <code>myfunc</code>. What should that code look like? How can we statically generate that code, if we don't know the type of <code>A1</code> at compile time?</p>

<p>Worse, what if it turns out at runtime that <code>n1 != n2</code>, so that <code>!std::is_same&lt;decltype(A1), decltype(A2)&gt;()</code>? In that case, the call to <code>myfunc</code> <strong>shouldn't even compile</strong>, because template type deduction should fail! How could we possibly emulate that behavior at runtime?</p>

<p>Basically, C++ is moving in the direction of pushing more and more decisions into <em>compile-time</em>: template code generation, <code>constexpr</code> function evaluation, and so on. Meanwhile, C99 was busy pushing traditionally <em>compile-time</em> decisions (e.g. <code>sizeof</code>) into the <em>runtime</em>. With this in mind, does it really even make sense to expend any effort <em>trying</em> to integrate C99-style VLAs into C++?</p>

<p>As every other answerer has already pointed out, C++ provides lots of heap-allocation mechanisms (<code>std::unique_ptr&lt;int[]&gt; A = new int[n];</code> or <code>std::vector&lt;int&gt; A(n);</code> being the obvious ones) when you really want to convey the idea "I have no idea how much RAM I might need." And C++ provides a nifty exception-handling model for dealing with the inevitable situation that the amount of RAM you need is greater than the amount of RAM you have. But hopefully <em>this</em> answer gives you a good idea of why C99-style VLAs were <strong>not</strong> a good fit for C++  and not really even a good fit for C99. ;)</p>

Bjarne's POV is very different from mine; N3810 focuses more on finding a good C++ish <em>syntax</em> for the things, and on discouraging the use of raw arrays in C++, whereas I focused more on the implications for metaprogramming and the typesystem. I don't know if he considers the metaprogramming/typesystem implications solved, solvable, or merely uninteresting.</p>

<p>There recently was a discussion about this kicked off in usenet: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.std.c++/browse_thread/thread/2bfe25800d4961e8/9545494bbb336dfa" rel="noreferrer">Why no VLAs in C++0x</a>. </p>

<p>I agree with those people that seem to agree that having to create a potential large array on the stack, which usually has only little space available, isn't good. The argument is, if you know the size beforehand, you can use a static array. And if you don't know the size beforehand, you will write unsafe code. </p>

<p>C99 VLAs could provide a small benefit of being able to create small arrays without wasting space or calling constructors for unused elements, but they will introduce rather large changes to the type system (you need to be able to specify types depending on runtime values - this does not yet exist in current C++, except for <code>new</code> operator type-specifiers, but they are treated specially, so that the runtime-ness doesn't escape the scope of the <code>new</code> operator).</p>

<p>You can use <code>std::vector</code>, but it is not quite the same, as it uses dynamic memory, and making it use one's own stack-allocator isn't exactly easy (alignment is an issue, too). It also doesn't solve the same problem, because a vector is a resizable container, whereas VLAs are fixed-size. The <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2648.html" rel="noreferrer">C++ Dynamic Array</a> proposal is intended to introduce a library based solution, as alternative to a language based VLA. However, it's not going to be part of C++0x, as far as I know.</p>

<p>You could always use alloca() to allocate memory on the stack at runtime, if you wished:</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-type">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">foo</span> <span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-type">int</span> n)</span>

<p>Being allocated on the stack implies that it will automatically be freed when the stack unwinds.</p>

<p>In my own work, I've realized that every time I've wanted something like variable-length automatic arrays or alloca(), I didn't really care that the memory was physically located on the cpu stack, just that it came from some stack allocator that didn't incur slow trips to the general heap.  So I have a per-thread object that owns some memory from which it can push/pop variable sized buffers.  On some platforms I allow this to grow via mmu.  Other platforms have a fixed size (usually accompanied by a fixed size cpu stack as well because no mmu).  One platform I work with (a handheld game console) has precious little cpu stack anyway because it resides in scarce, fast memory.</p>

<p>I'm not saying that pushing variable-sized buffers onto the cpu stack is never needed.  Honestly I was surprised back when I discovered this wasn't standard, as it certainly seems like the concept fits into the language well enough.  For me though, the requirements "variable size" and "must be physically located on the cpu stack" have never come up together.  It's been about speed, so I made my own sort of "parallel stack for data buffers".</p>

<p>There are situations where allocating heap memory is very expensive compared to the operations performed. An example is matrix math. If you work with smallish matrices say 5 to 10 elements  and do a lot of arithmetics the malloc overhead will be really significant. At the same time making the size a compile time constant does seem very wasteful and inflexible.</p>

<p>I think that C++ is so unsafe in itself that the argument to "try to not add more unsafe features" is not very strong. On the other hand, as C++ is arguably the most runtime efficient programming language features which makes it more so are always useful: People who write performance critical programs will to a large extent use C++, and they need as much performance as possible. Moving stuff from heap to stack is one such possibility. Reducing the number of heap blocks is another. Allowing VLAs as object members would one way to achieve this. I'm working on such a suggestion. It is a bit complicated to implement, admittedly, but it seems quite doable.</p>

<p>VLAs are a part of a larger family of Variably Modified types.
This family of types is very special because they have <em>runtime</em> components.</p>
<p>The code:</p>
<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> A[n];
</code></pre>
<p>Is seen by compiler as:</p>
<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-keyword">typedef</span> <span class="hljs-type">int</span> T[n];
T A;
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the runtime size of array is not bound to the variable <code>A</code> but to the <strong>type</strong> of the variable.</p>
<p>Nothing prevents one from making new variables of this type:</p>
<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp">T B,C,D;
</code></pre>
<p>or the pointers or arrays</p>
<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp">T *p, Z[<span class="hljs-number">10</span>];
</code></pre>
<p>Moreover, pointers allow one to create VLAs with dynamic storage.</p>
<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp">T *p = <span class="hljs-built_in">malloc</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">sizeof</span>(T));
...
<span class="hljs-built_in">free</span>(p);
</code></pre>
<p>What dispels a <strong>popular myth</strong> that VLAs can only be allocated on stack.</p>
<p>Back to the question.</p>
<p>This runtime component does not work well with type deduction which is one of the bases with C++ typing system. It would not possible to use templates, deduction and  overloading.</p>
<p>C++ typing system is static, all types must be fully defined or deduced during <em>compilation</em>.
VM types are completed only during program <em>execution</em>.
Additional complexity introducing VM types to already hellishly complex C++ was simply considered unjustified. Mainly because their main practical application
are automatic VLAs (<code>int A[n];</code>) which have an alternative in form of <code>std::vector</code>.</p>
<p>It a bit sad because VM types provides very elegant and efficient solutions to programs handling multidimensional arrays.</p>
<p>In C one can simply write:</p>
<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-type">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">foo</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-type">int</span> n, <span class="hljs-type">int</span> A[n][n][n])</span> </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-type">int</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; n; ++i)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-type">int</span> j = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; j &lt; n; ++j)
      <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-type">int</span> k = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; k &lt; n; ++k)
        A[i][j][k] = i * j * k;
}

...

<span class="hljs-type">int</span> A[<span class="hljs-number">5</span>][<span class="hljs-number">5</span>][<span class="hljs-number">5</span>], B[<span class="hljs-number">10</span>][<span class="hljs-number">10</span>][<span class="hljs-number">10</span>];
<span class="hljs-built_in">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-number">5</span>, A);
<span class="hljs-built_in">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-number">10</span>, B);
</code></pre>
<p>Now try to provide as efficient and elegant solution in C++.</p>

<p>I have a solution that actually worked for me.  I did not want to allocate memory because of fragmentation on a routine that needed to run many times.  The answer is extremely dangerous, so use it at your own risk, but it takes advantage of assembly to reserve space on the stack.  My example below uses a character array (obviously other sized variable would require more memory).</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-type">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">varTest</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-type">int</span> iSz)</span>
</span>{
    <span class="hljs-type">char</span> *varArray;
    __asm {
        sub esp, iSz       <span class="hljs-comment">// Create space on the stack for the variable array here</span>
        mov varArray, esp  <span class="hljs-comment">// save the end of it to our pointer</span>
    }

    <span class="hljs-comment">// Use the array called varArray here...  </span>

    __asm {
        add esp, iSz       <span class="hljs-comment">// Variable array is no longer accessible after this point</span>
    } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>The dangers here are many but I'll explain a few:
1. Changing the variable size half way through would kill the stack position
2. Overstepping the array bounds would destroy other variables and possible code
3. This does not work in a 64 bit build... need different assembly for that one (but a macro might solve that problem).
4. Compiler specific (may have trouble moving between compilers).  I haven't tried so I really don't know.</p>

How could we possibly emulate that behavior at runtime?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Basically, C++ is moving in the direction of pushing more and more decisions into \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;compile-time\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;: template code generation, \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;constexpr\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; function evaluation, and so on.

The argument is, if you know the size beforehand, you can use a static array. And if you don\u0026apos;t know the size beforehand, you will write unsafe code. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;C99 VLAs could provide a small benefit of being able to create small arrays without wasting space or calling constructors for unused elements, but they will introduce rather large changes to the type system (you need to be able to specify types depending on runtime values - this does not yet exist in current C++, except for \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;new\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; operator type-specifiers, but they are treated specially, so that the runtime-ness doesn\u0026apos;t escape the scope of the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;new\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; operator).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You can use \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;std::vector\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, but it is not quite the same, as it uses dynamic memory, and making it use one\u0026apos;s own stack-allocator isn\u0026apos;t exactly easy (alignment is an issue, too). It also doesn\u0026apos;t solve the same problem, because a vector is a resizable container, whereas VLAs are fixed-size.

So I have a per-thread object that owns some memory from which it can push/pop variable sized buffers.  On some platforms I allow this to grow via mmu.  Other platforms have a fixed size (usually accompanied by a fixed size cpu stack as well because no mmu).  One platform I work with (a handheld game console) has precious little cpu stack anyway because it resides in scarce, fast memory.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I\u0026apos;m not saying that pushing variable-sized buffers onto the cpu stack is never needed.  Honestly I was surprised back when I discovered this wasn\u0026apos;t standard, as it certainly seems like the concept fits into the language well enough.  For me though, the requirements \u0026quot;variable size\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;must be physically located on the cpu stack\u0026quot; have never come up together.  It\u0026apos;s been about speed, so I made my own sort of \u0026quot;parallel stack for data buffers\u0026quot;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;There are situations where allocating heap memory is very expensive compared to the operations performed. An example is matrix math. If you work with smallish matrices say 5 to 10 elements  and do a lot of arithmetics the malloc overhead will be really significant. At the same time making the size a compile time constant does seem very wasteful and inflexible.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I think that C++ is so unsafe in itself that the argument to \u0026quot;try to not add more unsafe features\u0026quot; is not very strong. On the other hand, as C++ is arguably the most runtime efficient programming language features which makes it more so are always useful: People who write performance critical programs will to a large extent use C++, and they need as much performance as possible. Moving stuff from heap to stack is one such possibility. Reducing the number of heap blocks is another. Allowing VLAs as object members would one way to achieve this. I\u0026apos;m working on such a suggestion.
