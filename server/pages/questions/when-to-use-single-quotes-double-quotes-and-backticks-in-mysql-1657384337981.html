Double quotes are supported by MySQL for string values as well, but single quotes are more widely accepted by other RDBMS, so it is a good habit to use single quotes instead of double.\nMySQL also expects DATE and DATETIME literal values to be single-quoted as strings like &apos;2001-01-01 00:00:00&apos;. Consult the Date and Time Literals documentation for more details, in particular alternatives to using the hyphen - as a segment delimiter in date strings.\nSo using your example, I would double-quote the PHP string and use single quotes on the values &apos;val1&apos;, &apos;val2&apos;.  NULL is a MySQL keyword, and a special (non)-value, and is therefore unquoted.\nNone of these table or column identifiers are reserved words or make use of characters requiring quoting, but I&apos;ve quoted them anyway with backticks (more on this later...).\nFunctions native to the RDBMS (for example, NOW() in MySQL) should not be quoted, although their arguments are subject to the same string or identifier quoting rules already mentioned.\nBacktick (`)\ntable &amp; column \n                                                          \n$query = &quot;INSERT INTO `table` (`id`, `col1`, `col2`, `date`, `updated`) \n                       VALUES (NULL, &apos;val1&apos;, &apos;val2&apos;, &apos;2001-01-01&apos;, NOW())&quot;;\n                                                          \nUnquoted keyword                                    \nSingle-quoted (&apos;) strings               \nSingle-quoted (&apos;) DATE      \nUnquoted function             \n\nVariable interpolation\nThe quoting patterns for variables do not change, although if you intend to interpolate the variables directly in a string, it must be double-quoted in PHP. Just make sure that you have properly escaped the variables for use in SQL. (It is recommended to use an API supporting prepared statements instead, as protection against SQL injection).\n// Same thing with some variable replacements\n// Here, a variable table name $table is backtick-quoted, and variables\n// in the VALUES list are single-quoted \n$query = &quot;INSERT INTO `$table` (`id`, `col1`, `col2`, `date`) VALUES (NULL, &apos;$val1&apos;, &apos;$val2&apos;, &apos;$date&apos;)&quot;;\n\nPrepared statements\nWhen working with prepared statements, consult the documentation to determine whether or not the statement&apos;s placeholders must be quoted.  The most popular APIs available in PHP, PDO and MySQLi, expect unquoted placeholders, as do most prepared statement APIs in other languages:\n// PDO example with named parameters, unquoted\n$query = &quot;INSERT INTO `table` (`id`, `col1`, `col2`, `date`) VALUES (:id, :col1, :col2, :date)&quot;;\n\n// MySQLi example with ? parameters, unquoted\n$query = &quot;INSERT INTO `table` (`id`, `col1`, `col2`, `date`) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)&quot;;\n\nCharacters requring backtick quoting in identifiers:\nAccording to MySQL documentation, you do not need to quote (backtick) identifiers using the following character set:\n\nASCII: [0-9,a-z,A-Z$_] (basic Latin letters, digits 0-9, dollar, underscore)\n\nYou can use characters beyond that set as table or column identifiers, including whitespace for example, but then you must quote (backtick) them.\nAlso, although numbers are valid characters for identifiers, identifiers cannot consist solely of numbers. If they do they must be wrapped in backticks.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"There are two types of quotes in MySQL:\n\n&apos; for enclosing string literals\n` for enclosing identifiers such as table and column names\n\nAnd then there is &quot; which is a special case.

Double-quoted strings are interpreted by PHP for possible variable-substitution (backticks in PHP are not exactly strings; they execute a command in the shell and return the result).\n\nExamples:\n\n$foo = &quot;bar&quot;;\necho &apos;there is a $foo&apos;; // There is a $foo\necho &quot;there is a $foo&quot;; // There is a bar\necho `ls -l`; // ... a directory list\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Backticks are generally used to indicate an identifier and as well be safe from accidentally using the Reserved Keywords. \n\nFor example:\n\nUse `database`;\n\n\nHere the backticks will help the server to understand that the database is in fact the name of the database, not the database identifier.\n\nSame can be done for the table names and field names. This is a very good habit if you wrap your database identifier with backticks.\n\n\n  Check this answer to understand more about backticks.\n\n\n\n\nNow about Double quotes &amp; Single Quotes (Michael has already mentioned that).\n\nBut, to define a value you have to use either single or double quotes. Lets see another example.\n\nINSERT INTO `tablename` (`id, `title`) VALUES ( NULL, title1);\n\n\nHere I have deliberately forgotten to wrap the title1 with quotes. Now the server will take the title1 as a column name (i.e. an identifier). So, to indicate that it&apos;s a value you have to use either double or single quotes.\n\nINSERT INTO `tablename` (`id, `title`) VALUES ( NULL, &apos;title1&apos;);\n\n\n\n\nNow, in combination with PHP, double quotes and single quotes make your query writing time much easier.

Like\n\n$val1 = &quot;my value 1&quot;;\n$val2 = &quot;my value 2&quot;;\n$query = &quot;INSERT INTO `table` (`id`, `col1`, `col2`) VALUES (NULL, &apos;$val1&apos;, &apos;$val2&apos;)&quot;;\n\n\nwill make\n\nINSERT INTO `table` (`id`, `col1`, `col2`) VALUES (NULL, &apos;my value 1&apos;, &apos;my value 2&apos;)\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"In MySQL, these symbols are used to delimit a query ` ,&quot; ,&apos; and () .\n\n\n&quot; or &apos; are used for enclosing string-like values &quot;26-01-2014 00:00:00&quot; or &apos;26-01-2014 00:00:00&apos; .

<p>I am trying to learn the best way to write queries. I also understand the importance of being consistent. Until now, I have randomly used single quotes, double quotes, and backticks without any real thought.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">$query <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'INSERT INTO table (id, col1, col2) VALUES (NULL, val1, val2)'</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>Also, in the above example, consider that <code>table</code>, <code>col1</code>, <code>val1</code>, etc. may be variables.</p>

<p>What is the standard for this? What do you do?</p>

<p>Backticks are to be used for table and column identifiers, but are only necessary when the identifier is a <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/keywords.html" rel="noreferrer">MySQL reserved keyword</a>, or when the identifier contains whitespace characters or characters beyond a limited set (see below) It is often recommended to avoid using reserved keywords as column or table identifiers when possible, avoiding the quoting issue.</p>
<p>Single quotes should be used for string values like in the <code>VALUES()</code> list.  Double quotes are supported by MySQL for string values as well, but single quotes are more widely accepted by other RDBMS, so it is a good habit to use single quotes instead of double.</p>
<p>MySQL also expects <code>DATE</code> and <code>DATETIME</code> literal values to be single-quoted as strings like <code>'2001-01-01 00:00:00'</code>. Consult <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/date-and-time-literals.html" rel="noreferrer">the Date and Time Literals</a> documentation for more details, in particular alternatives to using the hyphen <code>-</code> as a segment delimiter in date strings.</p>
<p>So using your example, I would double-quote the PHP string and use single quotes on the values <code>'val1', 'val2'</code>.  <code>NULL</code> is a MySQL keyword, and a special (non)-value, and is therefore unquoted.</p>
<p>None of these table or column identifiers are reserved words or make use of characters requiring quoting, but I've quoted them anyway with backticks (more on this later...).</p>
<p>Functions native to the RDBMS (for example, <code>NOW()</code> in MySQL) should not be quoted, although their arguments are subject to the same string or identifier quoting rules already mentioned.</p>
<pre>Backtick (`)
table &amp; column 
                                                          
$query = "<b>INSERT INTO `table` (`id`, `col1`, `col2`, `date`, `updated`) 
                       VALUES (NULL, 'val1', 'val2', '2001-01-01', NOW())</b>";
                                                          
Unquoted keyword                                    
Single-quoted (') strings               
Single-quoted (') DATE      
Unquoted function             
</pre>
<h3>Variable interpolation</h3>
<p>The quoting patterns for variables do not change, although if you intend to interpolate the variables directly in a string, it must be double-quoted in PHP. Just make sure that you have properly escaped the variables for use in SQL. (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60174/how-to-prevent-sql-injection-in-php">It is recommended to use an API supporting prepared statements instead, as protection against SQL injection</a>).</p>
<pre>// Same thing with some variable replacements
// Here, a variable table name $table is backtick-quoted, and variables
// in the VALUES list are single-quoted 
$query = "INSERT INTO <b>`$table`</b> (`id`, `col1`, `col2`, `date`) VALUES (NULL, <b>'$val1'</b>, <b>'$val2'</b>, <b>'$date'</b>)";
</pre>
<h3>Prepared statements</h3>
<p>When working with prepared statements, consult the documentation to determine whether or not the statement's placeholders must be quoted.  The most popular APIs available in PHP, PDO and MySQLi, expect <em>unquoted</em> placeholders, as do most prepared statement APIs in other languages:</p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-operator">/</span> PDO example <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> named parameters, unquoted
$query <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> "INSERT INTO `table` (`id`, `col1`, `col2`, `date`) VALUES (:id, :col1, :col2, :date)";

<span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-operator">/</span> MySQLi example <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> ? parameters, unquoted
$query <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> "INSERT INTO `table` (`id`, `col1`, `col2`, `date`) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)";
</code></pre>
<h3>Characters requring backtick quoting in identifiers:</h3>
<p><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/identifiers.html" rel="noreferrer">According to MySQL documentation</a>, you do not need to quote (backtick) identifiers using the following character set:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ASCII: <code>[0-9,a-z,A-Z$_]</code> (basic Latin letters, digits 0-9, dollar, underscore)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can use characters beyond that set as table or column identifiers, including whitespace for example, but then you <em>must</em> quote (backtick) them.</p>
<p>Also, although numbers are valid characters for identifiers, identifiers cannot consist solely of numbers. If they do they must be wrapped in backticks.</p>

<p>There are two types of quotes in MySQL:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>'</code> for enclosing string literals</li>
<li><code>`</code> for enclosing identifiers such as table and column names</li>
</ol>
<p>And then there is <code>"</code> which is a special case. It could be used for <em>one</em> of above-mentioned purposes at a time depending on MySQL server's <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/sql-mode.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>sql_mode</code></a>:</p>

</ol>
<h3>The following query will produce different results (or errors) depending on SQL mode:</h3>

</code></pre>
<h3>ANSI_QUOTES disabled</h3>
<p>The query will select the string literal <code>"column"</code> where column <code>foo</code> is equal to string <code>"bar"</code></p>
<h3>ANSI_QUOTES enabled</h3>
<p>The query will select the column <code>column</code> where column <code>foo</code> is equal to column <code>bar</code></p>
<h3>When to use what</h3>
<ul>
<li>I suggest that you avoid using <code>"</code> so that your code becomes independent of SQL modes</li>
<li>Always quote identifiers since it is a good practice (quite a few questions on SO discuss this)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(There are good answers above regarding the SQL nature of your question, but this may also be relevant if you are new to PHP.)</em></p>

<p>Perhaps it is important to mention that PHP handles single and double quoted strings differently...</p>

<p>Single-quoted strings are 'literals' and are pretty much WYSIWYG strings. Double-quoted strings are interpreted by PHP for possible variable-substitution (backticks in PHP are not exactly strings; they execute a command in the shell and return the result).</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>Backticks are generally used to indicate an <code>identifier</code> and as well be <strong>safe</strong> from accidentally using the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/keywords.html" rel="noreferrer">Reserved Keywords</a>. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">Use `database`;
</code></pre>

<p>Here the backticks will help the server to understand that the <code>database</code> is in fact the name of the database, not the database identifier.</p>

<p>Same can be done for the table names and field names. This is a very <em>good habit</em> if you wrap your database identifier with backticks.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now about Double quotes &amp; Single Quotes (Michael has already mentioned that).</p>

<p>But, to define a value you have to use either single or double quotes. Lets see another example.</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">INSERT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">INTO</span> `tablename` (`id, `title`) <span class="hljs-keyword">VALUES</span> ( <span class="hljs-keyword">NULL</span>, title1);
</code></pre>

<p>Here I have deliberately forgotten to wrap the <code>title1</code> with quotes. Now the server will take the <code>title1</code> as a column name (i.e. an identifier). So, to indicate that it's a value you have to use either double or single quotes.</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">INSERT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">INTO</span> `tablename` (`id, `title`) <span class="hljs-keyword">VALUES</span> ( <span class="hljs-keyword">NULL</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'title1'</span>);
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Now, in combination with PHP, double quotes and single quotes make your query writing time much easier. Let's see a modified version of the query in your question.</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">$query <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> "INSERT INTO `table` (`id`, `col1`, `col2`) VALUES (NULL, '$val1', '$val2')";
</code></pre>

<p>Now, using double quotes in the PHP, you will make the variables <code>$val1</code>, and <code>$val2</code> to use their values thus creating a perfectly valid query. Like</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">$val1 <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> "my value 1";
$val2 <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> "my value 2";
$query <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> "INSERT INTO `table` (`id`, `col1`, `col2`) VALUES (NULL, '$val1', '$val2')";
</code></pre>

<p>will make</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">INSERT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">INTO</span> `<span class="hljs-keyword">table</span>` (`id`, `col1`, `col2`) <span class="hljs-keyword">VALUES</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">NULL</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'my value 1'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'my value 2'</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>The string literals in MySQL and PHP are the same.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A string is a sequence of bytes or characters, enclosed within either
  single quote (') or double quote (") characters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if your string contains single quotes, then you could use double quotes to quote the string, or if it contains double quotes, then you could use single quotes to quote the string. But if your string contains both single quotes and double quotes, you need to escape the one that used to quote the string.</p>

<p>Mostly, we use single quotes for an SQL string value, so we need to use double quotes for a PHP string.</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">$query <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> "INSERT INTO table (id, col1, col2) VALUES (NULL, 'val1', 'val2')";
</code></pre>

<p>And you could use a variable in PHP's double-quoted string:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">$query <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> "INSERT INTO table (id, col1, col2) VALUES (NULL, '$val1', '$val2')";
</code></pre>

<p>But if <code>$val1</code> or <code>$val2</code> contains single quotes, that will make your SQL be wrong. So you need to escape it before it is used in sql; that is what <code>mysql_real_escape_string</code> is for. (Although a prepared statement is better.)</p>

<p>There has been many helpful answers here, generally culminating into two points.</p>

<ol>
<li>BACKTICKS(`) are used around identifier names.</li>
<li>SINGLE QUOTES(') are used around values. </li>
</ol>

<p>AND as @MichaelBerkowski said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Backticks are to be used for table and column identifiers, but are
  only necessary when the identifier is a <code>MySQL</code> reserved keyword, or
  when the identifier contains whitespace characters or characters
  beyond a limited set (see below) It is often recommended to avoid

  avoiding the quoting issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a case though where an identifier can neither be a <em>reserved keyword</em> or contain <em>whitespace</em> or <em>characters beyond limited set</em> but necessarily require backticks around them.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE</p>

<p><code>123E10</code> is a valid identifier name but also a valid <code>INTEGER</code> literal.</p>

<p>[Without going into detail how you would get such an identifier name], Suppose I want to create a temporary table named <code>123456e6</code>.</p>

<p>Use back ticks <code>``</code> when a column/value name is similar to a MySQL reserved keyword.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are denoting a column name with a table name then use back ticks like this:</p>

<p><code>`table_name`</code>. <code>`column_name`</code>   &lt;-- Note: exclude <code>.</code>  from back ticks.</p>

<p>SQL servers and MySQL, PostgreySQL, Oracle don't understand double quotes("). Thus your query should be free from double quotes(") and should only use single quotes(').</p>

<p>Back-trip(`) is optional to use in SQL and is used for table name, db name and column names.</p>

<p>If you are trying to write query in your back-end to call MySQL then you can use double quote(") or single quotes(') to assign query to a variable like:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">let query <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> "select id, name from accounts";
<span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-keyword">Or</span>
let query <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'select id, name from accounts'</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>If ther's a <code>where</code> statement in your query and/or trying to <code>insert</code> a value and/or an <code>update</code> of value which is string use single quote(') for these values like:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">let querySelect <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> "select id, name from accounts where name = 'John'";
let queryUpdate <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> "update accounts set name = 'John' where id = 8";
let queryInsert <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> "insert into accounts(name) values('John')";

<span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-operator">/</span>Please <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> that <span class="hljs-keyword">double</span> quotes <span class="hljs-keyword">are</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">only</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> be used <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> assigning string <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> our variable <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> the query
<span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-keyword">All</span> these below will generate error

let querySelect <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'select id, name from accounts where name = "John"'</span>;
let queryUpdate <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'update accounts set name = "John" where id = 8'</span>;
let queryInsert <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'insert into accounts(name) values("John")'</span>;

<span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-keyword">As</span> MySQL <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">any</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">SQL</span> doesn<span class="hljs-string">'t understand double quotes("), these all will generate error.
</span></code></pre>

<p>If you want to stay out of this confusion when to use double quotes(") and single quotes('), would recommend to stick with single quotes(') this will include backslash() like:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">let query <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'select is, name from accounts where name = \'</span>John\<span class="hljs-string">''</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>Problem with double(") or single(') quotes arise when we had to assign some value dynamic and perform some string concatenation like:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">let query <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> "select id, name from accounts where name = " <span class="hljs-operator">+</span> fName <span class="hljs-operator">+</span> " " <span class="hljs-operator">+</span> lName;
<span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-operator">/</span>This will generate error <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> it must be <span class="hljs-keyword">like</span> name <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'John Smith'</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">SQL</span>
<span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-operator">/</span>However our statement made it <span class="hljs-keyword">like</span> name <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> John Smith

<span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-keyword">In</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">order</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> resolve such errors use
let query <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> "select id, name from accounts where name = '" <span class="hljs-operator">+</span> fName <span class="hljs-operator">+</span> " " <span class="hljs-operator">+</span> lName <span class="hljs-operator">+</span> "'";

<span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-keyword">Or</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">using</span> backslash(\)
let query <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'select id, name from accounts where name = \'' + fName + '</span> <span class="hljs-string">' + lName + '</span>\<span class="hljs-string">''</span>;
