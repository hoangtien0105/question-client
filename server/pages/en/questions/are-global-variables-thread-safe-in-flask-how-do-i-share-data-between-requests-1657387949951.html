If I run this on my development server, I expect to get 1, 2, 3 and so on.  If requests are made from 100 different clients simultaneously, can something go wrong? The expected result would be that the 100 different clients each see a unique number from 1 to 100. Or will something like this happen:

Client 1 queries. self.param is incremented by 1.
Before the return statement can be executed, the thread switches over to client 2. self.param is incremented again.
The thread switches back to client 1, and the client is returned the number 2, say.
Now the thread moves to client 2 and returns him/her the number 3.

Since there were only two clients, the expected results were 1 and 2, not 2 and 3. A number was skipped.
Will this actually happen as I scale up my application? What alternatives to a global variable should I look at?

<p>While totally accepting the previous upvoted answers, and discouraging use of global variables for production and scalable Flask storage, for the purpose of prototyping or really simple servers, running under the flask 'development server'...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The Python built-in data types, and I personally used and tested the global <code>dict</code>, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-global-interpreter-lock" rel="nofollow noreferrer">as per Python documentation</a> are <strong>thread</strong> safe. Not <strong>process</strong> safe.</p>
<p>The insertions, lookups, and reads from such a (server global) dict will be OK from each (possibly concurrent) Flask session running under the development server.</p>
<p>When such a global dict is keyed with a unique Flask session key, it can be rather useful for server-side storage of session specific data otherwise not fitting into the cookie (max size 4 kB).</p>
<p>Of course, such a server global dict should be carefully guarded for growing too large, being in-memory. Some sort of expiring the 'old' key/value pairs can be coded during request processing.</p>
<p>Again, it is not recommended for production or scalable deployments, but it is possibly OK for local task-oriented servers where a separate database is too much for the given task.</p>

A database, memcached, or redis are all appropriate separate storage areas, depending on your needs. If you need to load and access Python data, consider \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/28426819\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;multiprocessing.Manager\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.
