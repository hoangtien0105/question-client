How can I fix this?\n    ","answerCount":30,"upVoteCount":500,"suggestedAnswer":[{"text":"Although there are portions of this answer that apply to only to the usage of themail() function itself, many of these troubleshooting steps can be applied to any PHP mailing system.\nThere are a variety of reasons your script appears to not be sending emails. It&apos;s difficult to diagnose these things unless there is an obvious syntax error. Without one you need to run through the checklist below to find any potential pitfalls you may be encountering.\nMake sure error reporting is enabled and set to report all errors\nError reporting is essential to rooting out bugs in your code and general errors that PHP encounters. Error reporting needs to be enabled to receive these errors. Placing the following code at the top of your PHP files (or in a master configuration file) will enable error reporting.\nerror_reporting(-1);\nini_set(&apos;display_errors&apos;, &apos;On&apos;);\nset_error_handler(&quot;var_dump&quot;);\n\nSee How can I get useful error messages in PHP?  this answer for more details on this.\nMake sure the mail() function is called\nIt may seem silly but a common error is to forget to actually place the mail() function in your code. Make sure it is there and not commented out.\nMake sure the mail() function is called correctly\n\nbool mail ( string $to, string $subject, string $message [, string $additional_headers [, string $additional_parameters ]] )\n\nThe mail function takes three required parameters and optionally a fourth and fifth one. If your call to mail() does not have at least three parameters it will fail.\nIf your call to mail() does not have the correct parameters in the correct order it will also fail.\nCheck the server&apos;s mail logs\nYour web server should be logging all attempts to send emails through it. The location of these logs will vary (you may need to ask your server administrator where they are located) but they can commonly be found in a user&apos;s root directory under logs. Inside will be error messages the server reported, if any, related to your attempts to send emails.\nCheck for Port connection failure\nPort block is a very common problem which most developers face while integrating their code to deliver emails using SMTP. And, this can be easily traced at the server maillogs (the location of server of mail log can vary from server to server, as explained above). In case you are on a shared hosting server, the ports 25 and 587 remain blocked by default. This block is been purposely done by your hosting provider. This is true even for some of the dedicated servers. When these ports are blocked, try to connect using port 2525. If you find that port is also blocked, then the only solution is to contact your hosting provider to unblock these ports.\nMost of the hosting providers block these email ports to protect their network from sending any spam emails.\nUse ports 25 or 587 for plain/TLS connections and port 465 for SSL connections. For most users, it is suggested to use port 587 to avoid rate limits set by some hosting providers.\nDon&apos;t use the error suppression operator\nWhen the error suppression operator @ is prepended to an expression in PHP, any error messages that might be generated by that expression will be ignored. There are circumstances where using this operator is necessary but sending mail is not one of them.\nIf your code contains @mail(...) then you may be hiding important error messages that will help you debug this. Remove the @ and see if any errors are reported.\nIt&apos;s only advisable when you check with error_get_last() right afterwards for concrete failures.\nCheck the mail() return value\nThe mail() function:\n\nReturns TRUE if the mail was successfully accepted for delivery, FALSE otherwise. It is important to note that just because the mail was accepted for delivery, it does NOT mean the mail will actually reach the intended destination.\n\nThis is important to note because:\n\nIf you receive a FALSE return value you know the error lies with your server accepting your mail. This probably isn&apos;t a coding issue but a server configuration issue. You need to speak to your system administrator to find out why this is happening.\nIf you receive a TRUE return value it does not mean your email will definitely be sent. It just means the email was sent to its respective handler on the server successfully by PHP. There are still more points of failure outside of PHP&apos;s control that can cause the email to not be sent.\n\nSo FALSE will help point you in the right direction whereas TRUE does not necessarily mean your email was sent successfully. This is important to note!\nMake sure your hosting provider allows you to send emails and does not limit mail sending\nMany shared webhosts, especially free webhosting providers, either do not allow emails to be sent from their servers or limit the amount that can be sent during any given time period. This is due to their efforts to limit spammers from taking advantage of their cheaper services.\nIf you think your host has emailing limits or blocks the sending of emails, check their FAQs to see if they list any such limitations. Otherwise, you may need to reach out to their support to verify if there are any restrictions in place around the sending of emails.\nCheck spam folders; prevent emails from being flagged as spam\nOftentimes, for various reasons, emails sent through PHP (and other server-side programming languages) end up in a recipient&apos;s spam folder. Always check there before troubleshooting your code.\nTo avoid mail sent through PHP from being sent to a recipient&apos;s spam folder, there are various things you can do, both in your PHP code and otherwise, to minimize the chances your emails are marked as spam. Good tips from Michiel de Mare include:\n\n\nUse email authentication methods, such as SPF, and DKIM to prove that your emails and your domain name belong together, and to prevent spoofing of your domain name. The SPF website includes a wizard to generate the DNS information for your site.\nCheck your reverse DNS to make sure the IP address of your mail server points to the domain name that you use for sending mail.\nMake sure that the IP-address that you&apos;re using is not on a blacklist\nMake sure that the reply-to address is a valid, existing address.\nUse the full, real name of the addressee in the To field, not just the email-address (e.g. &quot;John Smith&quot; &lt;john@blacksmiths-international.com&gt; ).\nMonitor your abuse accounts, such as abuse@yourdomain.example and postmaster@yourdomain.example. That means - make sure that these accounts exist, read what&apos;s sent to them, and act on complaints.\nFinally, make it really easy to unsubscribe. Otherwise, your users will unsubscribe by pressing the spam button, and that will affect your reputation.\n\n\nSee How do you make sure email you send programmatically is not automatically marked as spam? for more on this topic.\nMake sure all mail headers are supplied\nSome spam software will reject mail if it is missing common headers such as &quot;From&quot; and &quot;Reply-to&quot;:\n$headers = array(&quot;From: from@example.com&quot;,\n    &quot;Reply-To: replyto@example.com&quot;,\n    &quot;X-Mailer: PHP/&quot; . PHP_VERSION\n);\n$headers = implode(&quot;\\r\\n&quot;, $headers);\nmail($to, $subject, $message, $headers);\n\nMake sure mail headers have no syntax errors\nInvalid headers are just as bad as having no headers. One incorrect character could be all it takes to derail your email. Double-check to make sure your syntax is correct as PHP will not catch these errors for you.\n$headers = array(&quot;From from@example.com&quot;, // missing colon\n    &quot;Reply To: replyto@example.com&quot;,      // missing hyphen\n    &quot;X-Mailer: &quot;PHP&quot;/&quot; . PHP_VERSION      // bad quotes\n);\n\nDon&apos;t use a faux From: sender\nWhile the mail must have a From: sender, you may not just use any value. In particular user-supplied sender addresses are a surefire way to get mails blocked:\n$headers = array(&quot;From: $_POST[contactform_sender_email]&quot;); // No!\n\nReason: your web or sending mail server is not SPF/DKIM-whitelisted to pretend being responsible for @hotmail or @gmail addresses. It may even silently drop mails with From: sender domains it&apos;s not configured for.\nMake sure the recipient value is correct\nSometimes the problem is as simple as having an incorrect value for the recipient of the email. This can be due to using an incorrect variable.\n$to = &apos;user@example.com&apos;;\n// other variables ....\nmail($recipient, $subject, $message, $headers); // $recipient should be $to\n\nAnother way to test this is to hard code the recipient value into the mail() function call:\nmail(&apos;user@example.com&apos;, $subject, $message, $headers);\n\nThis can apply to all of the mail() parameters.\nSend to multiple accounts\nTo help rule out email account issues, send your email to multiple email accounts at different email providers. If your emails are not arriving at a user&apos;s Gmail account, send the same emails to a Yahoo account, a Hotmail account, and a regular POP3 account (like your ISP-provided email account).\nIf the emails arrive at all or some of the other email accounts, you know your code is sending emails but it is likely that the email account provider is blocking them for some reason. If the email does not arrive at any email account, the problem is more likely to be related to your code.\nMake sure the code matches the form method\nIf you have set your form method to POST, make sure you are using $_POST to look for your form values. If you have set it to GET or didn&apos;t set it at all, make sure you use $_GET to look for your form values.\nMake sure your form action value points to the correct location\nMake sure your form action attribute contains a value that points to your PHP mailing code.\n&lt;form action=&quot;send_email.php&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot;&gt;\n\nMake sure the Web host supports sending email\nSome Web hosting providers do not allow or enable the sending of emails through their servers. The reasons for this may vary but if they have disabled the sending of mail you will need to use an alternative method that uses a third party to send those emails for you.\nAn email to their technical support (after a trip to their online support or FAQ) should clarify if email capabilities are available on your server.\nMake sure the localhost mail server is configured\nIf you are developing on your local workstation using WAMP, MAMP, or XAMPP, an email server is probably not installed on your workstation. Without one, PHP cannot send mail by default.\nYou can overcome this by installing a basic mail server. For Windows you can use the free Mercury Mail.\nYou can also use SMTP to send your emails. See this great answer from Vikas Dwivedi to learn how to do this.\nEnable PHP&apos;s custom mail.log\nIn addition to your MTA&apos;s and PHP&apos;s log file, you can enable logging for the mail() function specifically. It doesn&apos;t record the complete SMTP interaction, but at least function call parameters and invocation script.\nini_set(&quot;mail.log&quot;, &quot;/tmp/mail.log&quot;);\nini_set(&quot;mail.add_x_header&quot;, TRUE);\n\nSee http://php.net/manual/en/mail.configuration.php for details. (It&apos;s best to enable these options in the php.ini or .user.ini or .htaccess perhaps.)\nCheck with a mail testing service\nThere are various delivery and spamminess checking services you can utilize to test your MTA/webserver setup. Typically you send a mail probe To: their address, then get a delivery report and more concrete failures or analyzations later:\n\nmail-tester.example (free/simple)\nglockapps.com (free/$$$)\nsenforensics.com (signup/$$$)\nmailtrap.io (pro/$$$)\nultratools//emailTest (free/MX checks only)\nVarious: http://www.verticalresponse.com/blog/7-email-testing-delivery-tools/\n\nUse a different mailer\nPHP&apos;s built-in mail() function is handy and often gets the job done but it has its shortcomings. Fortunately, there are alternatives that offer more power and flexibility including handling a lot of the issues outlined above:\n\nMost popular being: PHPMailer\nLikewise featureful: SwiftMailer\nOr even the older PEAR::Mail.\n\nAll of which can be combined with a professional SMTP server/service provider. (Because typical 08/15 shared webhosting plans are hit or miss when it comes to email setup/configurability.)\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Add a mail header in the mail function:\n\n$header = &quot;From: noreply@example.com\\r\\n&quot;;\n$header.= &quot;MIME-Version: 1.0\\r\\n&quot;;\n$header.= &quot;Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\\r\\n&quot;;\n$header.= &quot;X-Priority: 1\\r\\n&quot;;\n\n$status = mail($to, $subject, $message, $header);\n\nif($status)\n{\n    echo &apos;&lt;p&gt;Your mail has been sent!&lt;/p&gt;&apos;;\n} else {\n    echo &apos;&lt;p&gt;Something went wrong.

There&apos;s some answers that touch on this, but not the why of it.\nPHP&apos;s mail function is not only opaque, it fully relies on whatever MTA you use (i.e. Sendmail) to do the work. mail will only tell you if the MTA failed to accept it (i.e. Sendmail was down when you tried to send). It cannot tell you if the mail was successful because it&apos;s handed it off. As such (as John Conde&apos;s answer details), you now get to fiddle with the logs of the MTA and hope that it tells you enough about the failure to fix it. If you&apos;re on a shared host or don&apos;t have access to the MTA logs, you&apos;re out of luck. Sadly, the default for most vanilla installs for Linux handle it this way.\nA mail library (PHPMailer, Zend Framework 2+, etc.), does something very different from mail. They open a socket directly to the receiving mail server and then send the SMTP mail commands directly over that socket. In other words, the class acts as its own MTA (note that you can tell the libraries to use mail to ultimately send the mail, but I would strongly recommend you not do that).\nThis means you can then directly see the responses from the receiving server (in PHPMailer, for instance, you can turn on debugging output). No more guessing if a mail failed to send or why.\n\nIf you&apos;re using SMTP (i.e. you&apos;re calling isSMTP()), you can get a detailed transcript of the SMTP conversation using the SMTPDebug property.\nSet this option by including a line like this in your script:\n$mail-&gt;SMTPDebug = 2;\n\n\nYou also get the benefit of a better interface. With mail you have to set up all your headers, attachments, etc. With a library, you have a dedicated function to do that. It also means the function is doing all the tricky parts (like headers).\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution11","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"$name = $_POST[&apos;name&apos;];\n$email = $_POST[&apos;email&apos;];\n$reciver = &apos;/* Reciver Email address */&apos;;\nif (filter_var($reciver, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {\n    $subject = $name;\n    // To send HTML mail, the Content-type header must be set.\n    $headers = &apos;MIME-Version: 1.0&apos; . &quot;\\r\\n&quot;;\n    $headers .= &apos;Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1&apos; . &quot;\\r\\n&quot;;\n    $headers .= &apos;From:&apos; . $email. &quot;\\r\\n&quot;; // Sender&apos;s Email\n    //$headers .= &apos;Cc:&apos; . $email. &quot;\\r\\n&quot;; // Carbon copy to Sender\n    $template = &apos;&lt;div style=&quot;padding:50px; color:white;&quot;&gt;Hello ,&lt;br/&gt;&apos;\n        . &apos;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&apos;\n        . &apos;Name:&apos; .$name.&apos;&lt;br/&gt;&apos;\n        . &apos;Email:&apos; .$email.&apos;&lt;br/&gt;&apos;\n        . &apos;&lt;br/&gt;&apos;\n        . &apos;&lt;/div&gt;&apos;;\n    $sendmessage = &quot;&lt;div style=\\&quot;background-color:#7E7E7E; color:white;\\&quot;&gt;&quot; . $template . &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;;\n    // Message lines should not exceed 70 characters (PHP rule), so wrap it.\n    $sendmessage = wordwrap($sendmessage, 70);\n    // Send mail by PHP Mail Function.\n    mail($reciver, $subject, $sendmessage, $headers);\n    echo &quot;Your Query has been received, We will contact you soon.&quot;;\n} else {\n    echo &quot;&lt;span&gt;* invalid email *&lt;/span&gt;&quot;;\n}\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution12","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You can use config email by CodeIgniter.

<p>I've tried creating a simple mail form. The form itself is on my <code>index.html</code> page, but it submits to a separate "thank you for your submission" page, <code>thankyou.php</code>, where the above PHP code is embedded.
The code submits perfectly, but never sends an email. How can I fix this?</p>

<p><em>Although there are portions of this answer that apply to only to the usage of the<code>mail()</code> function itself, many of these troubleshooting steps can be applied to any PHP mailing system.</em></p>
<p>There are a variety of reasons your script appears to not be sending emails. It's difficult to diagnose these things unless there is an obvious syntax error. Without one you need to run through the checklist below to find any potential pitfalls you may be encountering.</p>
<h1>Make sure error reporting is enabled and set to report all errors</h1>
<p>Error reporting is essential to rooting out bugs in your code and general errors that PHP encounters. Error reporting needs to be enabled to receive these errors. Placing the following code at the top of your PHP files (or in a master configuration file) will enable error reporting.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-scss"><span class="hljs-built_in">error_reporting</span>(-<span class="hljs-number">1</span>);
<span class="hljs-built_in">ini_set</span>('display_errors', 'On');
<span class="hljs-built_in">set_error_handler</span>("var_dump");
</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/845021/how-can-i-get-useful-error-messages-in-php/845025#845025">How can I get useful error messages in PHP?</a>  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/845025/250259">this answer</a> for more details on this.</p>
<h1>Make sure the <code>mail()</code> function is called</h1>
<p>It may seem silly but a common error is to forget to actually place the <code>mail()</code> function in your code. Make sure it is there and not commented out.</p>
<h1>Make sure the <code>mail()</code> function is called correctly</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>bool mail ( string $to, string $subject, string $message [, string $additional_headers [, string $additional_parameters ]] )</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mail function takes three required parameters and optionally a fourth and fifth one. If your call to <code>mail()</code> does not have at least three parameters it will fail.</p>
<p>If your call to <code>mail()</code> does not have the correct parameters in the correct order it will also fail.</p>
<h1>Check the server's mail logs</h1>
<p>Your web server should be logging all attempts to send emails through it. The location of these logs will vary (you may need to ask your server administrator where they are located) but they can commonly be found in a user's root directory under <code>logs</code>. Inside will be error messages the server reported, if any, related to your attempts to send emails.</p>
<h1>Check for Port connection failure</h1>
<p>Port block is a very common problem which most developers face while integrating their code to deliver emails using SMTP. And, this can be easily traced at the server maillogs (the location of server of mail log can vary from server to server, as explained above). In case you are on a shared hosting server, the ports 25 and 587 remain blocked by default. This block is been purposely done by your hosting provider. This is true even for some of the dedicated servers. When these ports are blocked, try to connect using port 2525. If you find that port is also blocked, then the only solution is to contact your hosting provider to unblock these ports.</p>
<p>Most of the hosting providers block these email ports to protect their network from sending any spam emails.</p>
<p>Use ports 25 or 587 for plain/TLS connections and port 465 for SSL connections. For most users, it is suggested to use port 587 to avoid rate limits set by some hosting providers.</p>
<h1>Don't use the error suppression operator</h1>
<p>When the <a href="http://www.php.net//manual/en/language.operators.errorcontrol.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">error suppression operator</a> <code>@</code> is prepended to an expression in PHP, any error messages that might be generated by that expression will be ignored. There are circumstances where using this operator is necessary but sending mail is <em>not</em> one of them.</p>
<p>If your code contains <code>@mail(...)</code> then you may be hiding important error messages that will help you debug this. Remove the <code>@</code> and see if any errors are reported.</p>
<p>It's only advisable when you <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4913817/catching-php-mail-errors-and-showing-reasonable-user-error-message">check with <code>error_get_last()</code></a> right afterwards for concrete failures.</p>
<h1>Check the <code>mail()</code> return value</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>mail()</code></a> function:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Returns <code>TRUE</code> if the mail was successfully accepted for delivery, <code>FALSE</code> otherwise. It is important to note that just because the mail was accepted for delivery, it does NOT mean the mail will actually reach the intended destination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is important to note because:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you receive a <code>FALSE</code> return value you know the error lies with your server accepting your mail. This probably isn't a coding issue but a server configuration issue. You need to speak to your system administrator to find out why this is happening.</li>
<li>If you receive a <code>TRUE</code> return value it does not mean your email will definitely be sent. It just means the email was sent to its respective handler on the server successfully by PHP. There are still more points of failure outside of PHP's control that can cause the email to not be sent.</li>
</ul>
<p>So <code>FALSE</code> will help point you in the right direction whereas <code>TRUE</code> does <em>not</em> necessarily mean your email was sent successfully. This is important to note!</p>
<h1>Make sure your hosting provider allows you to send emails and does not limit mail sending</h1>
<p>Many shared webhosts, especially free webhosting providers, either do not allow emails to be sent from their servers or limit the amount that can be sent during any given time period. This is due to their efforts to limit spammers from taking advantage of their cheaper services.</p>
<p>If you think your host has emailing limits or blocks the sending of emails, check their FAQs to see if they list any such limitations. Otherwise, you may need to reach out to their support to verify if there are any restrictions in place around the sending of emails.</p>
<h1>Check spam folders; prevent emails from being flagged as spam</h1>
<p>Oftentimes, for various reasons, emails sent through PHP (and other server-side programming languages) end up in a recipient's spam folder. Always check there before troubleshooting your code.</p>
<p>To avoid mail sent through PHP from being sent to a recipient's spam folder, there are various things you can do, both in your PHP code and otherwise, to minimize the chances your emails are marked as spam. Good tips from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/136/michiel-de-mare">Michiel de Mare</a> include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Use email authentication methods, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SPF</a>, and <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Postfix/DKIM" rel="nofollow noreferrer">DKIM</a> to prove that your emails and your domain name belong together, and to prevent spoofing of your domain name. The SPF website includes a wizard to generate the DNS information for your site.</li>
<li><a href="http://remote.12dt.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Check</a> your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_DNS_lookup" rel="nofollow noreferrer">reverse DNS</a> to make sure the IP address of your mail server points to the domain name that you use for sending mail.</li>
<li>Make sure that the IP-address that you're using is <a href="http://www.spamhaus.org/lookup.lasso" rel="nofollow noreferrer">not on a blacklist</a></li>
<li>Make sure that the reply-to address is a valid, existing address.</li>
<li>Use the full, real name of the addressee in the To field, not just the email-address (e.g. <code>"John Smith" &lt;john@blacksmiths-international.com&gt;</code> ).</li>
<li>Monitor your abuse accounts, such as <code>abuse@yourdomain.example</code> and <code>postmaster@yourdomain.example</code>. That means - make sure that these accounts exist, read what's sent to them, and act on complaints.</li>
<li>Finally, make it <strong>really</strong> easy to unsubscribe. Otherwise, your users will unsubscribe by pressing the <strong>spam</strong> button, and that will affect your reputation.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/371/250259">How do you make sure email you send programmatically is not automatically marked as spam?</a> for more on this topic.</p>
<h1>Make sure all mail headers are supplied</h1>
<p>Some spam software will reject mail if it is missing common headers such as "From" and "Reply-to":</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-perl">$headers = array(<span class="hljs-string">"From: from@example.com"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">"Reply-To: replyto@example.com"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">"X-Mailer: PHP/"</span> . PHP_VERSION
);
$headers = implode(<span class="hljs-string">"\r\n"</span>, $headers);
mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers);
</code></pre>
<h1>Make sure mail headers have no syntax errors</h1>
<p>Invalid headers are just as bad as having no headers. One incorrect character could be all it takes to derail your email. Double-check to make sure your syntax is correct as PHP will <em>not</em> catch these errors for you.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$headers</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"From from@example.com"</span>, <span class="hljs-comment">// missing colon</span>
    <span class="hljs-string">"Reply To: replyto@example.com"</span>,      <span class="hljs-comment">// missing hyphen</span>
    <span class="hljs-string">"X-Mailer: "</span>PHP<span class="hljs-string">"/"</span> . PHP_VERSION      <span class="hljs-comment">// bad quotes</span>
);
</code></pre>
<h1>Don't use a faux <code>From:</code> sender</h1>
<p>While the mail must have a From: sender, you may not just use <em>any</em> value. In particular user-supplied sender addresses are a surefire way to get mails blocked:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$headers</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"From: <span class="hljs-subst">$_POST</span>[contactform_sender_email]"</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// No!</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Reason: your web or sending mail server is not SPF/DKIM-whitelisted to pretend being responsible for @hotmail or @gmail addresses. It may even silently drop mails with <code>From:</code> sender domains it's not configured for.</p>
<h1>Make sure the recipient value is correct</h1>
<p>Sometimes the problem is as simple as having an incorrect value for the recipient of the email. This can be due to using an incorrect variable.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-perl">$to = <span class="hljs-string">'user@example.com'</span>;
<span class="hljs-regexp">//</span> other variables ....
mail($recipient, $subject, $message, $headers); <span class="hljs-regexp">//</span> $recipient should be $to
</code></pre>
<p>Another way to test this is to hard code the recipient value into the <code>mail()</code> function call:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash">mail(<span class="hljs-string">'user@example.com'</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$subject</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$message</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$headers</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>This can apply to all of the <code>mail()</code> parameters.</p>
<h1>Send to multiple accounts</h1>
<p>To help rule out email account issues, send your email to multiple email accounts <em>at different email providers</em>. If your emails are not arriving at a user's Gmail account, send the same emails to a Yahoo account, a Hotmail account, and a regular POP3 account (like your ISP-provided email account).</p>
<p>If the emails arrive at all or some of the other email accounts, you know your code is sending emails but it is likely that the email account provider is blocking them for some reason. If the email does not arrive at any email account, the problem is more likely to be related to your code.</p>
<h1>Make sure the code matches the form method</h1>
<p>If you have set your form method to <code>POST</code>, make sure you are using <code>$_POST</code> to look for your form values. If you have set it to <code>GET</code> or didn't set it at all, make sure you use <code>$_GET</code> to look for your form values.</p>
<h1>Make sure your form <code>action</code> value points to the correct location</h1>
<p>Make sure your form <code>action</code> attribute contains a value that points to your PHP mailing code.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">form</span> <span class="hljs-attr">action</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"send_email.php"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">method</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"POST"</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<h1>Make sure the Web host supports sending email</h1>
<p>Some Web hosting providers do not allow or enable the sending of emails through their servers. The reasons for this may vary but if they have disabled the sending of mail you will need to use an alternative method that uses a third party to send those emails for you.</p>
<p>An email to their technical support (after a trip to their online support or FAQ) should clarify if email capabilities are available on your server.</p>
<h1>Make sure the <code>localhost</code> mail server is configured</h1>
<p>If you are developing on your local workstation using WAMP, MAMP, or XAMPP, an email server is probably not installed on your workstation. Without one, PHP cannot send mail by default.</p>
<p>You can overcome this by installing a basic mail server. For Windows you can use the free <a href="http://www.pmail.com/overviews/ovw_mercury.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mercury Mail</a>.</p>
<p>You can also use SMTP to send your emails. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/18185233/250259">this great answer</a> from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/2560923/vikas-dwivedi">Vikas Dwivedi</a> to learn how to do this.</p>
<h1>Enable PHP's custom <code>mail.log</code></h1>
<p>In addition to your MTA's and PHP's log file, you can enable <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21871254/php-mail-how-to-override-or-bypass-mail-log-setting">logging for the <code>mail()</code> function</a> specifically. It doesn't record the complete SMTP interaction, but at least function call parameters and invocation script.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-lisp">ini_set(<span class="hljs-string">"mail.log"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"/tmp/mail.log"</span>)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
ini_set(<span class="hljs-string">"mail.add_x_header"</span>, TRUE)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/mail.configuration.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://php.net/manual/en/mail.configuration.php</a> for details. (It's best to enable these options in the <code>php.ini</code> or <code>.user.ini</code> or <code>.htaccess</code> perhaps.)</p>
<h1>Check with a mail testing service</h1>
<p>There are various delivery and spamminess checking services you can utilize to test your MTA/webserver setup. Typically you send a mail probe To: their address, then get a delivery report and more concrete failures or analyzations later:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h1>Use a different mailer</h1>
<p>PHP's built-in <code>mail()</code> function is handy and often gets the job done but it <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4565066/why-shouldnt-i-use-phps-mail-function/4565160#4565160">has its shortcomings</a>. Fortunately, there are alternatives that offer more power and flexibility including handling a lot of the issues outlined above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most popular being: <a href="https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PHPMailer</a></li>
<li>Likewise featureful: <a href="http://swiftmailer.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SwiftMailer</a></li>
<li>Or even the older <a href="https://pear.php.net/package/Mail" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PEAR::Mail</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of which can be combined with a professional SMTP server/service provider. (Because typical 08/15 shared webhosting plans are hit or miss when it comes to email setup/configurability.)</p>

<p>For anyone who finds this going forward, I would not recommend using <code>mail</code>. There's some answers that touch on this, but not the <strong>why</strong> of it.</p>
<p>PHP's <code>mail</code> function is not only opaque, it fully relies on whatever <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_transfer_agent" rel="noreferrer">MTA</a> you use (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendmail" rel="noreferrer">Sendmail</a>) to do the work. <code>mail</code> will <em>only</em> tell you if the MTA failed to accept it (i.e. Sendmail was down when you tried to send). It cannot tell you if the mail was successful because it's handed it off. As such (as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24644436/php-mail-function-doesnt-complete-sending-of-e-mail/24644450#24644450">John Conde's answer</a> details), you now get to fiddle with the logs of the MTA and hope that it tells you enough about the failure to fix it. If you're on a shared host or don't have access to the MTA logs, you're out of luck. Sadly, the default for most vanilla installs for Linux handle it this way.</p>
<p>A mail library (<a href="https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer" rel="noreferrer">PHPMailer</a>, Zend Framework 2+, etc.), does something very different from <code>mail</code>. They open a socket directly to the receiving mail server and then send the SMTP mail commands directly over that socket. In other words, the class acts as its own MTA (note that you can tell the libraries to use <code>mail</code> to ultimately send the mail, but I would strongly recommend you not do that).</p>
<p>This means you can then directly see the responses from the receiving server (in PHPMailer, for instance, you can <a href="https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki/Troubleshooting" rel="noreferrer">turn on debugging output</a>). No more guessing if a mail failed to send or why.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you're using SMTP (i.e. you're calling <code>isSMTP()</code>), you can get a detailed transcript of the SMTP conversation using the <code>SMTPDebug</code> property.</p>
<p>Set this option by including a line like this in your script:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-variable">$mail</span>-&gt;SMTPDebug = 2;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You also get the benefit of a better interface. With <code>mail</code> you have to set up all your headers, attachments, etc. With a library, you have a dedicated function to do that. It also means the function is doing all the tricky parts (like headers).</p>

<p>This will only affect a small handful of users, but I'd like it documented for that small handful.  This member of that small handful spent 6 hours troubleshooting a working PHP mail script because of this issue.  </p>

<p>If you're going to a university that runs XAMPP from www.AceITLab.com, you should know what our professor didn't tell us: The AceITLab firewall (not the Windows firewall) blocks MercuryMail in XAMPP.  You'll have to use an alternative mail client, pear is working for us.  You'll have to send to a Gmail account with low security settings.  </p>

<p>Yes, I know, this is totally useless for real world email.  However, from what I've seen, academic settings and the real world often have precious little in common.     </p>

<p><strong>For those who do not want to use external mailers and want to mail() on a dedicated Linux server.</strong></p>

<p>The way, how PHP mails, is described in <code>php.ini</code> in section <code>[mail function]</code>.</p>

<p>Parameter <code>sendmail-path</code> describes how sendmail is called. The default value is <code>sendmail -t -i</code>, so if you get a working <code>sendmail -t -i &lt; message.txt</code> in the Linux console - you will be done. You could also add <code>mail.log</code> to debug and be sure mail() is really called.</p>

<p>Different MTAs can implement <code>sendmail</code>. They just make a symbolic link to their binaries on that name. For example, in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Debian</a> the default is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postfix_(software)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Postfix</a>. Configure your MTA to send mail and test it from the console with <code>sendmail -v -t -i &lt; message.txt</code>. File <code>message.txt</code> should contain all headers of a message and a body, destination address for the envelope will be taken from the <code>To:</code> header. Example:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-symbol">From:</span> myapp@example.com
<span class="hljs-symbol">To:</span> mymail@example.com
<span class="hljs-symbol">Subject:</span> Test mail via sendmail.

<span class="hljs-keyword">Text</span> body.
</code></pre>

<p>I prefer to use <strong>ssmtp</strong> as MTA because it is simple and does not require running a daemon with opened ports. ssmtp fits only for sending mail from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost" rel="nofollow noreferrer">localhost</a>. It also can send authenticated email via your account on a public mail service. Install ssmtp and edit configuration file <code>/etc/ssmtp/ssmtp.conf</code>. To be able also to receive local system mail to Unix  accounts (alerts to root from cron jobs, for example) configure <code>/etc/ssmtp/revaliases</code> file.</p>

<p>Here is my configuration for my account on Yandex mail:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-ini"><span class="hljs-attr">root</span>=mymail@example.com
<span class="hljs-attr">mailhub</span>=smtp.yandex.ru:<span class="hljs-number">465</span>

<p>If you're stuck with an app hosted on Hostgator, <a href="https://forum.opencart.com/viewtopic.php?t=141563" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this</a> is what solved my problem. Thanks a lot to the guy who posted the detailed solution. In case the link goes offline one day, there you have the summary:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Look for the sendmail path in your server.</strong> A simple way to check it, is to temporarily write the following code in a page which only you will access, to read the generated info: <code>&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;</code>. Open this page, and look for <code>sendmail path</code>. (Then, don't forget to remove this code!)</li>
<li><strong>Problem and fix:</strong> if your sendmail path is saying only <code>-t -i</code>, then edit your server's <code>php.ini</code> and add the following line: <code>sendmail_path = /usr/sbin/sendmail -t -i;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>But, after being able to send mail with PHP <code>mail()</code> function, I learned that it sends not authenticated email, what created another issue. The emails were all falling in my Hotmail's junk mail box, and some emails were never delivered, which I guess is related to the fact that they are not authenticated. That's why I decided to switch from <code>mail()</code> to <code>PHPMailer</code> with SMTP, after all.</p>

<p><strong>Sending HTML email</strong>
While sending an email message you can specify a Mime version, content type and character set to send an HTML email.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>
The above example will send an HTML email message to name@example.com. You can code this program in such a way that it should receive all content from the user and then it should send an email.</p>

<p>What solved this issue for me was that some providers don't allow external recipients when using php mail:</p>
<p>Change the recipient ($recipient) in the code to a local recipient. This means use an email address from the server's domain, for example if your server domain is <a href="http://www.yourdomain.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">www.yourdomain.com</a> then the recipient's email should be someone@yourdomain.com.
Upload the modified php file and retry.
If it's still not working: change the sender ($sender) to a local email (use the same email as used for recipient).
Upload the modified php file and retry.</p>
<p>Hope this helps some!

<p>No need for the To: header.</p>
<p>Mail clients are pretty good at sniffing out URLs and rewriting them as a hyperlink. So I didn't bother writing HTML and specifying text/html in the content-type header. I just threw new lines with \r\n in the message body.
I appreciate this isn't the coding purist's approach but it works for what I need it for.</p>

They open a socket directly to the receiving mail server and then send the SMTP mail commands directly over that socket. In other words, the class acts as its own MTA (note that you can tell the libraries to use \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;mail\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to ultimately send the mail, but I would strongly recommend you not do that).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This means you can then directly see the responses from the receiving server (in PHPMailer, for instance, you can \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki/Troubleshooting\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;turn on debugging output\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;).
