As has already been mentioned, if you add a &apos;global&apos; declaration to func1(), then func2() will print 42.\ndef func1():\n    global _my_global \n    _my_global = 42\n\nWhat&apos;s going on here is that Python assumes that any name that is assigned to, anywhere within a function, is local to that function unless explicitly told otherwise.  If it is only reading from a name, and the name doesn&apos;t exist locally, it will try to look up the name in any containing scopes (e.g. the module&apos;s global scope).\nWhen you assign 42 to the name _my_global, therefore, Python creates a local variable that shadows the global variable of the same name.  That local goes out of scope and is garbage-collected when func1() returns; meanwhile, func2() can never see anything other than the (unmodified) global name.  Note that this namespace decision happens at compile time, not at runtime -- if you were to read the value of _my_global inside func1() before you assign to it, you&apos;d get an UnboundLocalError, because Python has already decided that it must be a local variable but it has not had any value associated with it yet.  But by using the &apos;global&apos; statement, you tell Python that it should look elsewhere for the name instead of assigning to it locally.\n(I believe that this behavior originated largely through an optimization of local namespaces -- without this behavior,  Python&apos;s VM would need to perform at least three name lookups each time a new name is assigned to inside a function (to ensure that the name didn&apos;t already exist at module/builtin level), which would significantly slow down a very common operation.)\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You may want to explore the notion of namespaces. In Python, the module is the natural place for global data:\n\nEach module has its own private symbol table, which is used as the global symbol table by all functions defined in the module. Thus, the author of a module can use global variables in the module without worrying about accidental clashes with a users global variables. On the other hand, if you know what you are doing you can touch a modules global variables with the same notation used to refer to its functions, modname.itemname.\n\nA specific use of global-in-a-module is described here - How do I share global variables across modules?, and for completeness the contents are shared here:\n\nThe canonical way to share information across modules within a single program is to create a special configuration module (often called config or cfg). Just import the configuration module in all modules of your application; the module then becomes available as a global name. Because there is only one instance of each module, any changes made to the module object get reflected everywhere. For example:\n\n\nFile: config.py\n\n\nx = 0   # Default value of the &apos;x&apos; configuration setting\n\n\n\nFile: mod.py\n\nimport config\nconfig.x = 1\n\n\nFile: main.py\n\nimport config\nimport mod\nprint config.x\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Python uses a simple heuristic to decide which scope it should load a variable from, between local and global.

I have not yet encountered such a reason.\n\nWe get the same behavior in classes\n\nA follow on comment asks:\n\n\n  what to do if I want to create a global variable inside a function inside a class and want to use that variable inside another function inside another class?\n\n\nHere I demonstrate we get the same behavior in methods as we do in regular functions:\n\nclass Foo:\n    def foo(self):\n        global global_variable\n        global_variable = &apos;Foo&apos;\n\nclass Bar:\n    def bar(self):\n        return global_variable + &apos;!!!&apos;\n\nFoo().foo()\n\n\nAnd now:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Bar().bar()\n&apos;Foo!!!&apos;\n\n\nBut I would suggest instead of using global variables you use class attributes, to avoid cluttering the module namespace. Also note we don&apos;t use self arguments here - these could be class methods (handy if mutating the class attribute from the usual cls argument) or static methods (no self or cls).\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution6","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"In addition to already existing answers and to make this more confusing:\n\n\n  In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are\n  implicitly global.

<p>Since it's unclear whether <code>globvar = 1</code> is creating a local variable or changing a global variable, Python defaults to creating a local variable, and makes you explicitly choose the other behavior with the <code>global</code> keyword.</p>

<p>If I'm understanding your situation correctly, what you're seeing is the result of how Python handles local (function) and global (module) namespaces.</p>
<p>Say you've got a module like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-comment"># sample.py</span>
_my_global = <span class="hljs-number">5</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">func1</span>():
    _my_global = <span class="hljs-number">42</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">func2</span>():
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> _my_global

func1()
func2()
</code></pre>
<p>You might expecting this to print 42, but instead it prints 5.  As has already been mentioned, if you add a '<code>global</code>' declaration to <code>func1()</code>, then <code>func2()</code> will print 42.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">func1</span>():
    <span class="hljs-keyword">global</span> _my_global 
    _my_global = <span class="hljs-number">42</span>
</code></pre>
<p>What's going on here is that Python assumes that any name that is <em>assigned to</em>, anywhere within a function, is local to that function unless explicitly told otherwise.  If it is only <em>reading</em> from a name, and the name doesn't exist locally, it will try to look up the name in any containing scopes (e.g. the module's global scope).</p>
<p>When you assign 42 to the name <code>_my_global</code>, therefore, Python creates a local variable that shadows the global variable of the same name.  That local goes out of scope and is <a href="http://www.digi.com/wiki/developer/index.php/Python_Garbage_Collection" rel="nofollow noreferrer">garbage-collected</a> when <code>func1()</code> returns; meanwhile, <code>func2()</code> can never see anything other than the (unmodified) global name.  Note that this namespace decision happens at compile time, not at runtime -- if you were to read the value of <code>_my_global</code> inside <code>func1()</code> before you assign to it, you'd get an <code>UnboundLocalError</code>, because Python has already decided that it must be a local variable but it has not had any value associated with it yet.  But by using the '<code>global</code>' statement, you tell Python that it should look elsewhere for the name instead of assigning to it locally.</p>
<p>(I believe that this behavior originated largely through an optimization of local namespaces -- without this behavior,  Python's VM would need to perform at least three name lookups each time a new name is assigned to inside a function (to ensure that the name didn't already exist at module/builtin level), which would significantly slow down a very common operation.)</p>

<p>You may want to explore the notion of <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html" rel="noreferrer">namespaces</a>. In Python, the <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html" rel="noreferrer">module</a> is the natural place for <em>global</em> data:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each module has its own private symbol table, which is used as the global symbol table by all functions defined in the module. Thus, the author of a module can use global variables in the module without worrying about accidental clashes with a users global variables. On the other hand, if you know what you are doing you can touch a modules global variables with the same notation used to refer to its functions, <code>modname.itemname</code>.</p>

<p>A specific use of global-in-a-module is described here - <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#how-do-i-share-global-variables-across-modules" rel="noreferrer">How do I share global variables across modules?</a>, and for completeness the contents are shared here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The canonical way to share information across modules within a single program is to create a special configuration module (often called <strong>config</strong> or <strong>cfg</strong>). Just import the configuration module in all modules of your application; the module then becomes available as a global name. Because there is only one instance of each module, any changes made to the module object get reflected everywhere. For example:</p>

<p>Python uses a simple heuristic to decide which scope it should load a variable from, between local and global.  If a variable name appears on the left hand side of an assignment, but is not declared global, it is assumed to be local.  If it does not appear on the left hand side of an assignment, it is assumed to be global.  </p>

<p>If you want to refer to a global variable in a function, you can use the <strong>global</strong> keyword to declare which variables are global. You don't have to use it in all cases (as someone here incorrectly claims) - if the name referenced in an expression cannot be found in local scope or scopes in the functions in which this function is defined, it is looked up among global variables.</p>

<p>However, if you assign to a new variable not declared as global in the function, it is implicitly declared as local, and it can overshadow any existing global variable with the same name.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h1>If I create a global variable in one function, how can I use that variable in another function?</h1>
</blockquote>

<p>We can create a global with the following function:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">create_global_variable</span>():
    <span class="hljs-keyword">global</span> global_variable <span class="hljs-comment"># must declare it to be a global first</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment"># modifications are thus reflected on the module's global scope</span>
    global_variable = <span class="hljs-string">'Foo'</span> 
</code></pre>

<p>Writing a function does not actually run its code. So we call the <code>create_global_variable</code> function:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>create_global_variable()
</code></pre>

<h2>Using globals without modification</h2>

<p>You can just use it, so long as you don't expect to change which object it points to: </p>

<p>For example, </p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">use_global_variable</span>():
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> global_variable + <span class="hljs-string">'!!!'</span>
</code></pre>

<p>and now we can use the global variable:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>use_global_variable()
<span class="hljs-string">'Foo!!!'</span>
</code></pre>

<h2>Modification of the global variable from inside a function</h2>

<p>To point the global variable at a different object, you are required to use the global keyword again:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">change_global_variable</span>():
    <span class="hljs-keyword">global</span> global_variable
    global_variable = <span class="hljs-string">'Bar'</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Note that after writing this function, the code actually changing it has still not run:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>use_global_variable()
<span class="hljs-string">'Foo!!!'</span>
</code></pre>

<p>So after calling the function:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>change_global_variable()
</code></pre>

<p>we can see that the global variable has been changed. The <code>global_variable</code> name now points to <code>'Bar'</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>use_global_variable()
<span class="hljs-string">'Bar!!!'</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Note that "global" in Python is not truly global - it's only global to the module level. So it is only available to functions written in the modules in which it is global. Functions remember the module in which they are written, so when they are exported into other modules, they still look in the module in which they were created to find global variables.</p>

<h1>Local variables with the same name</h1>

<p>If you create a local variable with the same name, it will overshadow a global variable:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">use_local_with_same_name_as_global</span>():
    <span class="hljs-comment"># bad name for a local variable, though.</span>
    global_variable = <span class="hljs-string">'Baz'</span> 
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> global_variable + <span class="hljs-string">'!!!'</span>

<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>use_local_with_same_name_as_global()
<span class="hljs-string">'Baz!!!'</span>
</code></pre>

<p>But using that misnamed local variable does not change the global variable:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>use_global_variable()
<span class="hljs-string">'Bar!!!'</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you should avoid using the local variables with the same names as globals unless you know precisely what you are doing and have a very good reason to do so. I have not yet encountered such a reason.</p>

<h2>We get the same behavior in classes</h2>

<p>A follow on comment asks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>what to do if I want to create a global variable inside a function inside a class and want to use that variable inside another function inside another class?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here I demonstrate we get the same behavior in methods as we do in regular functions:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Foo</span>:
    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self</span>):
        <span class="hljs-keyword">global</span> global_variable
        global_variable = <span class="hljs-string">'Foo'</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Bar</span>:
    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">bar</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self</span>):
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> global_variable + <span class="hljs-string">'!!!'</span>

Foo().foo()
</code></pre>

<p>And now:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>Bar().bar()
<span class="hljs-string">'Foo!!!'</span>
</code></pre>

<p>But I would suggest instead of using global variables you use class attributes, to avoid cluttering the module namespace. Also note we don't use <code>self</code> arguments here - these could be class methods (handy if mutating the class attribute from the usual <code>cls</code> argument) or static methods (no <code>self</code> or <code>cls</code>).</p>

<p>In addition to already existing answers and to make this more confusing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are
  <strong>implicitly global</strong>. If a variable is assigned a new value anywhere
  within the functions body, its assumed to be a <strong>local</strong>. If a variable
  is ever assigned a new value inside the function, the variable is
  implicitly local, and you need to explicitly declare it as global.</p>
  
  <p>Though a bit surprising at first, a moments consideration explains
  this. On one hand, requiring global for assigned variables provides a
  bar against unintended side-effects. On the other hand, if global was
  required for all global references, youd be using global all the
  time. Youd have to declare as global every reference to a built-in
  function or to a component of an imported module. This clutter would
  defeat the usefulness of the global declaration for identifying
  side-effects.</p>

<p>As it turns out the answer is always simple.</p>

<p>Here is a small sample module with a simple way to show it in a <code>main</code> definition:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">five</span>(<span class="hljs-params">enterAnumber,sumation</span>):

<span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">isTheNumber</span>():
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> helper

<p>Here is how to show it in a <code>main</code> definition:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> TestPy

<span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">main</span>():

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> __name__ == <span class="hljs-string">'__main__'</span>:

<p>This simple code works just like that, and it will execute. I hope it helps.</p>

<p>You're not actually storing the global in a local variable, just creating a local reference to the same object that your original global reference refers to. Remember that pretty much everything in Python is a name referring to an object, and nothing gets copied in usual operation.</p>

<p>If you didn't have to explicitly specify when an identifier was to refer to a predefined global, then you'd presumably have to explicitly specify when an identifier is a new local variable instead (for example, with something like the 'var' command seen in JavaScript). Since local variables are more common than global variables in any serious and non-trivial system, Python's system makes more sense in most cases.</p>

<p>You <em>could</em> have a language which attempted to guess, using a global variable if it existed or creating a local variable if it didn't. However, that would be very error-prone. For example, importing another module could inadvertently introduce a global variable by that name, changing the behaviour of your program.</p>

<p>There are 2 ways to declare a variable as global:</p>
<p><strong>1. assign variable inside functions and use global line</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. assign variable outside functions:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">global_variable_2 = <span class="hljs-number">2</span>

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note 1:</strong></p>
<p>If you want to change a global variable inside another function like <code>update_variables()</code> you should use global line in that function before assigning the variable:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">global_variable_1 = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>

<p>Explanation:</p>
<p><code>global_var</code> is a global variable and all functions and classes can access that variable.</p>
<p>The <code>func_1()</code> accessed that global variable using the keyword <code>global</code> which points to the variable which is written in the global scope. If I didn't write the global keyword the variable <code>global_var</code> inside <code>func_1</code> is considered a local variable that is only usable inside the function. Then inside <code>func_1</code>, I have incremented that global variable by 1.</p>
<p>The same happened in <code>func_2()</code>.</p>
<p>After calling <code>func_1</code> and <code>func_2</code>, you'll see the <code>global_var</code> is changed</p>

<p>If you declare a variable outside the strings, it become global.</p>
<p>If you declare a variable inside the strings, it become local.</p>
<p>If you want to declare a global variable inside the strings, use the keyword <code>global</code> before the variable you want to declare:</p>
