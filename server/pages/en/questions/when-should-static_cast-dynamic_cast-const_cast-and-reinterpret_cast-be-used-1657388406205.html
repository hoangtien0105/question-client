It does things like implicit conversions between types (such as int to float, or pointer to void*), and it can also call explicit conversion functions (or implicit ones). In many cases, explicitly stating static_cast isn&apos;t necessary, but it&apos;s important to note that the T(something) syntax is equivalent to (T)something and should be avoided (more on that later). A T(something, something_else) is safe, however, and guaranteed to call the constructor.\n\nstatic_cast can also cast through inheritance hierarchies. It is unnecessary when casting upwards (towards a base class), but when casting downwards it can be used as long as it doesn&apos;t cast through virtual inheritance. It does not do checking, however, and it is undefined behavior to static_cast down a hierarchy to a type that isn&apos;t actually the type of the object.\n\n\n\nconst_cast can be used to remove or add const to a variable; no other C++ cast is capable of removing it (not even reinterpret_cast). It is important to note that modifying a formerly const value is only undefined if the original variable is const; if you use it to take the const off a reference to something that wasn&apos;t declared with const, it is safe. This can be useful when overloading member functions based on const, for instance. It can also be used to add const to an object, such as to call a member function overload.\n\nconst_cast also works similarly on volatile, though that&apos;s less common.\n\n\n\ndynamic_cast is exclusively used for handling polymorphism. You can cast a pointer or reference to any polymorphic type to any other class type (a polymorphic type has at least one virtual function, declared or inherited). You can use it for more than just casting downwards  you can cast sideways or even up another chain. The dynamic_cast will seek out the desired object and return it if possible. If it can&apos;t, it will return nullptr in the case of a pointer, or throw std::bad_cast in the case of a reference.\n\ndynamic_cast has some limitations, though. It doesn&apos;t work if there are multiple objects of the same type in the inheritance hierarchy (the so-called &apos;dreaded diamond&apos;) and you aren&apos;t using virtual inheritance. It also can only go through public inheritance - it will always fail to travel through protected or private inheritance. This is rarely an issue, however, as such forms of inheritance are rare.\n\n\n\nreinterpret_cast is the most dangerous cast, and should be used very sparingly. It turns one type directly into another  such as casting the value from one pointer to another, or storing a pointer in an int, or all sorts of other nasty things. Largely, the only guarantee you get with reinterpret_cast is that normally if you cast the result back to the original type, you will get the exact same value (but not if the intermediate type is smaller than the original type). There are a number of conversions that reinterpret_cast cannot do, too. It&apos;s used primarily for particularly weird conversions and bit manipulations, like turning a raw data stream into actual data, or storing data in the low bits of a pointer to aligned data.\n\n\n\nC-style cast and function-style cast are casts using (type)object or type(object), respectively, and are functionally equivalent. They are defined as the first of the following which succeeds:\n\n\nconst_cast\nstatic_cast (though ignoring access restrictions)\nstatic_cast (see above), then const_cast\nreinterpret_cast\nreinterpret_cast, then const_cast\n\n\nIt can therefore be used as a replacement for other casts in some instances, but can be extremely dangerous because of the ability to devolve into a reinterpret_cast, and the latter should be preferred when explicit casting is needed, unless you are sure static_cast will succeed or reinterpret_cast will fail. Even then, consider the longer, more explicit option.\n\nC-style casts also ignore access control when performing a static_cast, which means that they have the ability to perform an operation that no other cast can. This is mostly a kludge, though, and in my mind is just another reason to avoid C-style casts.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"\nUse dynamic_cast for converting pointers/references within an inheritance hierarchy.\n\nUse static_cast for ordinary type conversions.\n\nUse reinterpret_cast for low-level reinterpreting of bit patterns.

Use static_cast for them.\nWhen you ask compiler to convert from type A to B, static_cast calls B&apos;s constructor passing A as param. Alternatively, A could have a conversion operator (i.e. A::operator B()).  If B doesn&apos;t have such constructor, or A doesn&apos;t have a conversion operator, then you get compile time error.\nCast from A* to B* always succeeds if A and B are in inheritance hierarchy (or void) otherwise you get compile error.\nGotcha: If you cast base pointer to derived pointer but if actual object is not really derived type then you don&apos;t get error. You get bad pointer and  very likely a segfault at runtime. Same goes for A&amp; to B&amp;.\nGotcha: Cast from Derived to Base or viceversa creates new copy! For people coming from C#/Java, this can be a huge surprise because the result is basically a chopped off object created from Derived.\n\ndynamic_cast\n\ndynamic_cast uses runtime type information to figure out if cast is valid. For example, (Base*) to (Derived*) may fail if pointer is not actually of derived type.\nThis means, dynamic_cast is very expensive compared to static_cast!\nFor A* to B*, if cast is invalid then dynamic_cast will return nullptr.\nFor A&amp; to B&amp; if cast is invalid then dynamic_cast will throw bad_cast exception.\nUnlike other casts, there is runtime overhead.\n\nconst_cast\n\nWhile static_cast can do non-const to const it can&apos;t go other way around. The const_cast can do both ways.\nOne example where this comes handy is iterating through some container like set&lt;T&gt; which only returns its elements as const to make sure you don&apos;t change its key. However if your intent is to modify object&apos;s non-key members then it should be ok. You can use const_cast to remove constness.\nAnother example is when you want to implement T&amp; SomeClass::foo() as well as const T&amp; SomeClass::foo() const. To avoid code duplication, you can apply const_cast to return value of one function from another.\n\nreinterpret_cast\n\nThis basically says that take these bytes at this memory location and think of it as given object.\nFor example, you can load 4 bytes of float to 4 bytes of int to see how bits in float looks like.\nObviously, if data is not correct for the type, you may get segfault.\nThere is no runtime overhead for this cast.\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Does this answer your question?\n\nI have never used reinterpret_cast, and wonder whether running into a case that needs it isn&apos;t a smell of bad design. In the code base I work on dynamic_cast is used a lot. The difference with  static_cast is that a dynamic_cast does runtime checking which may (safer) or may not (more overhead) be what you want (see msdn).\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"In addition to the other answers so far, here is unobvious example where static_cast is not sufficient so that reinterpret_cast is needed. Suppose there is a function which in an output parameter returns pointers to objects of different classes (which do not share a common base class). A real example of such function is CoCreateInstance() (see the last parameter, which is in fact void**). Suppose you request particular class of object from this function, so you know in advance the type for the pointer (which you often do for COM objects). In this case you cannot cast pointer to your pointer into void** with static_cast: you need reinterpret_cast&lt;void**&gt;(&amp;yourPointer). \n\nIn code:\n\n#include &lt;windows.h&gt;\n#include &lt;netfw.h&gt;\n.....\nINetFwPolicy2* pNetFwPolicy2 = nullptr;\nHRESULT hr = CoCreateInstance(__uuidof(NetFwPolicy2), nullptr,\n    CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, __uuidof(INetFwPolicy2),\n    //static_cast&lt;void**&gt;(&amp;pNetFwPolicy2) would give a compile error\n    reinterpret_cast&lt;void**&gt;(&amp;pNetFwPolicy2) );\n\n\nHowever, static_cast works for simple pointers (not pointers to pointers), so the above code can be rewritten to avoid reinterpret_cast (at a price of an extra variable) in the following way:\n\n#include &lt;windows.h&gt;\n#include &lt;netfw.h&gt;\n.....\nINetFwPolicy2* pNetFwPolicy2 = nullptr;\nvoid* tmp = nullptr;\nHRESULT hr = CoCreateInstance(__uuidof(NetFwPolicy2), nullptr,\n    CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, __uuidof(INetFwPolicy2),\n    &amp;tmp );\npNetFwPolicy2 = static_cast&lt;INetFwPolicy2*&gt;(tmp);\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution6","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"static_cast vs dynamic_cast vs reinterpret_cast internals view on a downcast/upcast\nIn this answer, I want to compare these three mechanisms on a concrete upcast/downcast example and analyze what happens to the underlying pointers/memory/assembly to give a concrete understanding of how they compare.\nI believe that this will give a good intuition on how those casts are different:\n\nstatic_cast: does one address offset at runtime (low runtime impact) and no safety checks that a downcast is correct.\n\ndyanamic_cast: does the same address offset at runtime like static_cast, but also and an expensive safety check that a downcast is correct using RTTI.\nThis safety check allows you to query if a base class pointer is of a given type at runtime by checking a return of nullptr which indicates an invalid downcast.\nTherefore, if your code is not able to check for that nullptr and take a valid non-abort action, you should just use static_cast instead of dynamic cast.\nIf an abort is the only action your code can take, maybe you only want to enable the dynamic_cast in debug builds (-NDEBUG), and use static_cast otherwise, e.g. as done here, to not slow down your fast runs.\n\nreinterpret_cast: does nothing at runtime, not even the address offset.

We also infer that what lies between 0x7fffffffc930 and 0x7fffffffc940 is likely be the B1 data and vtable.\nThen, on the downcast sections, it is now easy to understand how the invalid ones fail and why:\n\nstatic_cast&lt;D*&gt;(b2s[0])            0x7fffffffc910: the compiler just went up 0x10 at compile time bytes to try and go from a B2 to the containing D\nBut because b2s[0] was not a D, it now points to an undefined memory region.\nThe disassembly is:\n49          dp = static_cast&lt;D*&gt;(b2s[0]);\n   0x0000000000000fc8 &lt;+414&gt;:   48 8b 45 d0     mov    -0x30(%rbp),%rax\n   0x0000000000000fcc &lt;+418&gt;:   48 85 c0        test   %rax,%rax\n   0x0000000000000fcf &lt;+421&gt;:   74 0a   je     0xfdb &lt;main()+433&gt;\n   0x0000000000000fd1 &lt;+423&gt;:   48 8b 45 d0     mov    -0x30(%rbp),%rax\n   0x0000000000000fd5 &lt;+427&gt;:   48 83 e8 10     sub    $0x10,%rax\n   0x0000000000000fd9 &lt;+431&gt;:   eb 05   jmp    0xfe0 &lt;main()+438&gt;\n   0x0000000000000fdb &lt;+433&gt;:   b8 00 00 00 00  mov    $0x0,%eax\n   0x0000000000000fe0 &lt;+438&gt;:   48 89 45 98     mov    %rax,-0x68(%rbp)\n\nso we see that GCC does:\n\ncheck if pointer is NULL, and if yes return NULL\notherwise, subtract 0x10 from it to reach the D which does not exist\n\n\ndynamic_cast&lt;D*&gt;(b2s[0])           0: C++ actually found that the cast was invalid and returned nullptr!\nThere is no way this can be done at compile time, and we will confirm that from the disassembly:\n59          dp = dynamic_cast&lt;D*&gt;(b2s[0]);\n   0x00000000000010ec &lt;+706&gt;:   48 8b 45 d0     mov    -0x30(%rbp),%rax\n   0x00000000000010f0 &lt;+710&gt;:   48 85 c0        test   %rax,%rax\n   0x00000000000010f3 &lt;+713&gt;:   74 1d   je     0x1112 &lt;main()+744&gt;\n   0x00000000000010f5 &lt;+715&gt;:   b9 10 00 00 00  mov    $0x10,%ecx\n   0x00000000000010fa &lt;+720&gt;:   48 8d 15 f7 0b 20 00    lea    0x200bf7(%rip),%rdx        # 0x201cf8 &lt;_ZTI1D&gt;\n   0x0000000000001101 &lt;+727&gt;:   48 8d 35 28 0c 20 00    lea    0x200c28(%rip),%rsi        # 0x201d30 &lt;_ZTI2B2&gt;\n   0x0000000000001108 &lt;+734&gt;:   48 89 c7        mov    %rax,%rdi\n   0x000000000000110b &lt;+737&gt;:   e8 c0 fb ff ff  callq  0xcd0 &lt;__dynamic_cast@plt&gt;\n   0x0000000000001110 &lt;+742&gt;:   eb 05   jmp    0x1117 &lt;main()+749&gt;\n   0x0000000000001112 &lt;+744&gt;:   b8 00 00 00 00  mov    $0x0,%eax\n   0x0000000000001117 &lt;+749&gt;:   48 89 45 98     mov    %rax,-0x68(%rbp)\n\nFirst there is a NULL check, and it returns NULL if th einput is NULL.\nOtherwise, it sets up some arguments in the RDX, RSI and RDI and calls __dynamic_cast.\nI don&apos;t have the patience to analyze this further now, but as others said, the only way for this to work is for __dynamic_cast to access some extra RTTI in-memory data structures that represent the class hierarchy.\nIt must therefore start from the B2 entry for that table, then walk this class hierarchy until it finds that the vtable for a D typecast from b2s[0].\nThis is why dynamic cast is potentially expensive! Here is an example where a one liner patch converting a dynamic_cast to a static_cast in a complex project reduced runtime by 33%!.\n\nreinterpret_cast&lt;D*&gt;(b2s[1])           0x7fffffffc940 this one just believes us blindly: we said there is a D at address b2s[1], and the compiler does no offset calculations.\nBut this is wrong, because D is actually at 0x7fffffffc930, what is at 0x7fffffffc940 is the B2-like structure inside D! So trash gets accessed.\nWe can confirm this from the horrendous -O0 assembly that just moves the value around:\n70          dp = reinterpret_cast&lt;D*&gt;(b2s[1]);\n   0x00000000000011fa &lt;+976&gt;:   48 8b 45 d8     mov    -0x28(%rbp),%rax\n   0x00000000000011fe &lt;+980&gt;:   48 89 45 98     mov    %rax,-0x68(%rbp)\n\n\n\nRelated questions:\n\nWhen should static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast and reinterpret_cast be used?\nHow is dynamic_cast implemented\nDowncasting using the &apos;static_cast&apos; in C++\n\nTested on Ubuntu 18.04 amd64, GCC 7.4.0.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution7","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"While other answers nicely described all differences between C++ casts, I would like to add a short note why you should not use C-style casts (Type) var and Type(var).\n\nFor C++ beginners C-style casts look like being the superset operation over C++ casts (static_cast&lt;&gt;(), dynamic_cast&lt;&gt;(), const_cast&lt;&gt;(), reinterpret_cast&lt;&gt;()) and someone could prefer them over the C++ casts. In fact C-style cast is the superset and shorter to write.\n\nThe main problem of C-style casts is that they hide developer real intention of the cast. The C-style casts can do virtually all types of casting from normally safe casts done by static_cast&lt;&gt;() and dynamic_cast&lt;&gt;() to potentially dangerous casts like const_cast&lt;&gt;(), where const modifier can be removed so the const variables can be modified and reinterpret_cast&lt;&gt;() that can even reinterpret integer values to pointers.\n\nHere is the sample.\n\nint a=rand(); // Random number.\n\nint* pa1=reinterpret_cast&lt;int*&gt;(a); // OK. Here developer clearly expressed he wanted to do this potentially dangerous operation.\n\nint* pa2=static_cast&lt;int*&gt;(a); // Compiler error.\nint* pa3=dynamic_cast&lt;int*&gt;(a); // Compiler error.\n\nint* pa4=(int*) a; // OK. C-style cast can do such cast. The question is if it was intentional or developer just did some typo.\n\n*pa4=5; // Program crashes.\n\n\nThe main reason why C++ casts were added to the language was to allow a developer to clarify his intentions - why he is going to do that cast. By using C-style casts which are perfectly valid in C++ you are making your code less readable and more error prone especially for other developers who didn&apos;t create your code. So to make your code more readable and explicit you should always prefer C++ casts over C-style casts.\n\nHere is a short quote from Bjarne Stroustrup&apos;s (the author of C++) book The C++ Programming Language 4th edition - page 302.\n\n\n  This C-style cast is far more dangerous than the named conversion operators\n  because the notation is harder to spot in a large program and the kind of conversion intended by the programmer is not explicit.\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution8","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"To understand, let&apos;s consider below code snippet:\n\nstruct Foo{};\nstruct Bar{};\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv)\n{\n    Foo* f = new Foo;\n\n    Bar* b1 = f;                              // (1)\n    Bar* b2 = static_cast&lt;Bar*&gt;(f);           // (2)\n    Bar* b3 = dynamic_cast&lt;Bar*&gt;(f);          // (3)\n    Bar* b4 = reinterpret_cast&lt;Bar*&gt;(f);      // (4)\n    Bar* b5 = const_cast&lt;Bar*&gt;(f);            // (5)\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nOnly line (4) compiles without error. Only reinterpret_cast can be used to convert a pointer to an object to a pointer to an any unrelated object type.\n\nOne this to be noted is: The dynamic_cast would fail at run-time, however on most compilers it will also fail to compile because there are no virtual functions in the struct of the pointer being casted, meaning dynamic_cast will work with only polymorphic class pointers.\n\nWhen to use C++ cast:\n\n\nUse static_cast as the equivalent of a C-style cast that does value conversion, or when we need to explicitly up-cast a pointer from a class to its superclass.\nUse const_cast to remove the const qualifier.  \nUse reinterpret_cast to do unsafe conversions of pointer types to and from integer and other pointer types. Use this only if we know what we are doing and we understand the aliasing issues.\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution9","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Nice feature of reinterpret_cast, not mentioned in the other answers, is that it allows us to create a sort of void* pointer for function types. Normally, for object types one uses static_cast to retrieve the original type of a pointer stored in void*:\n  int i = 13;\n  void *p = &amp;i;\n  auto *pi = static_cast&lt;int*&gt;(p);\n\nFor functions, we must use reinterpret_cast twice:\n#include&lt;iostream&gt;\n\nusing any_fcn_ptr_t = void(*)();\n\n\nvoid print(int i)\n{\n   std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt;std::endl;\n}\n\nint main()\n{     \n  //Create type-erased pointer to function:\n  auto any_ptr = reinterpret_cast&lt;any_fcn_ptr_t&gt;(&amp;print);\n  \n  //Retrieve the original pointer:\n  auto ptr = reinterpret_cast&lt; void(*)(int) &gt;(any_ptr);\n  \n  ptr(7);\n}\n\nWith reinterpret_cast we can even get a similar sort-of-void* pointer for pointers to member functions.\nAs with plain void* and static_cast, C++ guarantees that ptr points to print function (as long as we pass the correct type to reinterpret_cast).\n

<p><strong><code>static_cast</code></strong> is the first cast you should attempt to use. It does things like implicit conversions between types (such as <code>int</code> to <code>float</code>, or pointer to <code>void*</code>), and it can also call explicit conversion functions (or implicit ones). In many cases, explicitly stating <code>static_cast</code> isn't necessary, but it's important to note that the <code>T(something)</code> syntax is equivalent to <code>(T)something</code> and should be avoided (more on that later). A <code>T(something, something_else)</code> is safe, however, and guaranteed to call the constructor.</p>

<p><code>static_cast</code> can also cast through inheritance hierarchies. It is unnecessary when casting upwards (towards a base class), but when casting downwards it can be used as long as it doesn't cast through <code>virtual</code> inheritance. It does not do checking, however, and it is undefined behavior to <code>static_cast</code> down a hierarchy to a type that isn't actually the type of the object.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><code>const_cast</code></strong> can be used to remove or add <code>const</code> to a variable; no other C++ cast is capable of removing it (not even <code>reinterpret_cast</code>). It is important to note that modifying a formerly <code>const</code> value is only undefined if the original variable is <code>const</code>; if you use it to take the <code>const</code> off a reference to something that wasn't declared with <code>const</code>, it is safe. This can be useful when overloading member functions based on <code>const</code>, for instance. It can also be used to add <code>const</code> to an object, such as to call a member function overload.</p>

<p><code>const_cast</code> also works similarly on <code>volatile</code>, though that's less common.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><code>dynamic_cast</code></strong> is exclusively used for handling polymorphism. You can cast a pointer or reference to any polymorphic type to any other class type (a polymorphic type has at least one virtual function, declared or inherited). You can use it for more than just casting downwards  you can cast sideways or even up another chain. The <code>dynamic_cast</code> will seek out the desired object and return it if possible. If it can't, it will return <code>nullptr</code> in the case of a pointer, or throw <code>std::bad_cast</code> in the case of a reference.</p>

<p><code>dynamic_cast</code> has some limitations, though. It doesn't work if there are multiple objects of the same type in the inheritance hierarchy (the so-called 'dreaded diamond') and you aren't using <code>virtual</code> inheritance. It also can only go through public inheritance - it will always fail to travel through <code>protected</code> or <code>private</code> inheritance. This is rarely an issue, however, as such forms of inheritance are rare.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><code>reinterpret_cast</code></strong> is the most dangerous cast, and should be used very sparingly. It turns one type directly into another  such as casting the value from one pointer to another, or storing a pointer in an <code>int</code>, or all sorts of other nasty things. Largely, the only guarantee you get with <code>reinterpret_cast</code> is that normally if you cast the result back to the original type, you will get the exact same value (but <strong><em>not</em></strong> if the intermediate type is smaller than the original type). There are a number of conversions that <strong><code>reinterpret_cast</code></strong> cannot do, too. It's used primarily for particularly weird conversions and bit manipulations, like turning a raw data stream into actual data, or storing data in the low bits of a pointer to aligned data.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>C-style cast</strong> and <strong>function-style cast</strong> are casts using <code>(type)object</code> or <code>type(object)</code>, respectively, and are functionally equivalent. They are defined as the first of the following which succeeds:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>const_cast</code></li>
<li><code>static_cast</code> (though ignoring access restrictions)</li>
<li><code>static_cast</code> (see above), then <code>const_cast</code></li>
<li><code>reinterpret_cast</code></li>
<li><code>reinterpret_cast</code>, then <code>const_cast</code></li>
</ul>

<p>It can therefore be used as a replacement for other casts in some instances, but can be extremely dangerous because of the ability to devolve into a <code>reinterpret_cast</code>, and the latter should be preferred when explicit casting is needed, unless you are sure <code>static_cast</code> will succeed or <code>reinterpret_cast</code> will fail. Even then, consider the longer, more explicit option.</p>

<p>C-style casts also ignore access control when performing a <code>static_cast</code>, which means that they have the ability to perform an operation that no other cast can. This is mostly a kludge, though, and in my mind is just another reason to avoid C-style casts.</p>

<p>It might help if you know little bit of internals...</p>
<p><strong>static_cast</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>C++ compiler already knows how to convert between scaler types such as <code>float</code> to <code>int</code>. Use <code>static_cast</code> for them.</li>
<li>When you ask compiler to convert from type <code>A</code> to <code>B</code>, <code>static_cast</code> calls <code>B</code>'s constructor passing <code>A</code> as param. Alternatively, <code>A</code> could have a conversion operator (i.e. <code>A::operator B()</code>).  If <code>B</code> doesn't have such constructor, or <code>A</code> doesn't have a conversion operator, then you get compile time error.</li>
<li>Cast from <code>A*</code> to <code>B*</code> always succeeds if A and B are in inheritance hierarchy (or void) otherwise you get compile error.</li>
<li><strong>Gotcha</strong>: If you cast base pointer to derived pointer but if actual object is not really derived type then you <em>don't</em> get error. You get bad pointer and  very likely a segfault at runtime. Same goes for <code>A&amp;</code> to <code>B&amp;</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Gotcha</strong>: Cast from Derived to Base or viceversa creates <em>new</em> copy! For people coming from C#/Java, this can be a huge surprise because the result is basically a chopped off object created from Derived.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>dynamic_cast</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>dynamic_cast uses runtime type information to figure out if cast is valid. For example, <code>(Base*)</code> to <code>(Derived*)</code> may fail if pointer is not actually of derived type.</li>
<li>This means, dynamic_cast is very expensive compared to static_cast!</li>
<li>For <code>A*</code> to <code>B*</code>, if cast is invalid then dynamic_cast will return nullptr.</li>
<li>For <code>A&amp;</code> to <code>B&amp;</code> if cast is invalid then dynamic_cast will throw bad_cast exception.</li>
<li>Unlike other casts, there is runtime overhead.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>const_cast</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While static_cast can do non-const to const it can't go other way around. The const_cast can do both ways.</li>
<li>One example where this comes handy is iterating through some container like <code>set&lt;T&gt;</code> which only returns its elements as const to make sure you don't change its key. However if your intent is to modify object's non-key members then it should be ok. You can use const_cast to remove constness.</li>
<li>Another example is when you want to implement <code>T&amp; SomeClass::foo()</code> as well as <code>const T&amp; SomeClass::foo() const</code>. To avoid code duplication, you can apply const_cast to return value of one function from another.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>reinterpret_cast</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This basically says that take these bytes at this memory location and think of it as given object.</li>
<li>For example, you can load 4 bytes of <code>float</code> to 4 bytes of <code>int</code> to see how bits in <code>float</code> looks like.</li>
<li>Obviously, if data is not correct for the type, you may get segfault.</li>
<li>There is no runtime overhead for this cast.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does <a href="http://www.cppreference.com/wiki/keywords/casting_comparison" rel="noreferrer">this</a> answer your question?</p>

<p>I have never used <code>reinterpret_cast</code>, and wonder whether running into a case that needs it isn't a smell of bad design. In the code base I work on <code>dynamic_cast</code> is used a lot. The difference with  <code>static_cast</code> is that a <code>dynamic_cast</code> does runtime checking which may (safer) or may not (more overhead) be what you want (see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c36yw7x9(VS.80).aspx" rel="noreferrer">msdn</a>).</p>

<p>In addition to the other answers so far, here is unobvious example where <code>static_cast</code> is not sufficient so that <code>reinterpret_cast</code> is needed. Suppose there is a function which in an output parameter returns pointers to objects of different classes (which do not share a common base class). A real example of such function is <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686615%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="noreferrer"><code>CoCreateInstance()</code></a> (see the last parameter, which is in fact <code>void**</code>). Suppose you request particular class of object from this function, so you know in advance the type for the pointer (which you often do for COM objects). In this case you cannot cast pointer to your pointer into <code>void**</code> with <code>static_cast</code>: you need <code>reinterpret_cast&lt;void**&gt;(&amp;yourPointer)</code>. </p>

<p>In code:</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-keyword">include</span> <span class="hljs-string">&lt;windows.h&gt;</span></span>

HRESULT hr = <span class="hljs-built_in">CoCreateInstance</span>(__uuidof(NetFwPolicy2), <span class="hljs-literal">nullptr</span>,

    <span class="hljs-built_in">reinterpret_cast</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-type">void</span>**&gt;(&amp;pNetFwPolicy2) );
</code></pre>

<p>However, <code>static_cast</code> works for simple pointers (not pointers to pointers), so the above code can be rewritten to avoid <code>reinterpret_cast</code> (at a price of an extra variable) in the following way:</p>

<p><strong><code>static_cast</code> vs <code>dynamic_cast</code> vs <code>reinterpret_cast</code> internals view on a downcast/upcast</strong></p>
<p>In this answer, I want to compare these three mechanisms on a concrete upcast/downcast example and analyze what happens to the underlying pointers/memory/assembly to give a concrete understanding of how they compare.</p>
<p>I believe that this will give a good intuition on how those casts are different:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>static_cast</code>: does one address offset at runtime (low runtime impact) and no safety checks that a downcast is correct.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>dyanamic_cast</code>: does the same address offset at runtime like <code>static_cast</code>, but also and an expensive safety check that a downcast is correct using RTTI.</p>
<p>This safety check allows you to query if a base class pointer is of a given type at runtime by checking a return of <code>nullptr</code> which indicates an invalid downcast.</p>
<p>Therefore, if your code is not able to check for that <code>nullptr</code> and take a valid non-abort action, you should just use <code>static_cast</code> instead of dynamic cast.</p>
<p>If an abort is the only action your code can take, maybe you only want to enable the <code>dynamic_cast</code> in debug builds (<code>-NDEBUG</code>), and use <code>static_cast</code> otherwise, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/gem5/gem5/blob/9fc9c67b4242c03f165951775be5cd0812f2a705/src/base/cast.hh#L40" rel="noreferrer">as done here</a>, to not slow down your fast runs.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>reinterpret_cast</code>: does nothing at runtime, not even the address offset. The pointer must point exactly to the correct type, not even a base class works. You generally don't want this unless raw byte streams are involved.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</code></pre>
<p>Now, as mentioned at: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table" rel="noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table</a> in order to support the virtual method calls efficiently, supposing that the memory data structures of B1 is of form:</p>
<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp">B1:
  +<span class="hljs-number">0</span>: pointer to <span class="hljs-keyword">virtual</span> method table of B1
  +<span class="hljs-number">4</span>: value of int_in_b1
</code></pre>
<p>and <code>B2</code> is of form:</p>
<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp">B2:
  +<span class="hljs-number">0</span>: pointer to <span class="hljs-keyword">virtual</span> method table of B2
  +<span class="hljs-number">4</span>: value of int_in_b2
</code></pre>
<p>then memory data structure of <code>D</code> has to look something like:</p>
<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp">D:
  +<span class="hljs-number">0</span>: <span class="hljs-function">pointer to <span class="hljs-keyword">virtual</span> method table of <span class="hljs-title">D</span> <span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> B1)</span>
  +4: value of int_in_b1
  +<span class="hljs-number">8</span>: pointer to virtual method table of D (for B2)
 +<span class="hljs-number">12</span>: value of int_in_b2
 +<span class="hljs-number">16</span>: value of int_in_d
</span></code></pre>
<p>The key fact is that the memory data structure of <code>D</code> contains inside it memory structure identical to that of <code>B1</code> and <code>B2</code>, i.e.:</p>
<ul>
<li>+0 looks exactly like a B1, with the B1 vtable for D followed by <code>int_in_b1</code></li>
<li>+8 looks exactly like a B2, with the B2 vtable for D followed by <code>int_in_b2</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore we reach the critical conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>an upcast or downcast only needs to shift the pointer value by a value known at compile time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This way, when <code>D</code> gets passed to the base type array, the type cast actually calculates that offset and points something that looks exactly like a valid <code>B2</code> in memory, except that this one has the vtable for <code>D</code> instead of <code>B2</code>, and therefore all virtual calls work transparently.</p>
<p>E.g.:</p>
<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp">b2s[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>] = &amp;d;
</code></pre>
<p>simply needs to get the address of <code>d</code> + 8 to reach the corresponding B2-like data structure.</p>
<p>Now, we can finally get back to type casting and the analysis of our concrete example.</p>
<p>From the stdout output we see:</p>
<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp">&amp;d           <span class="hljs-number">0x7fffffffc930</span>
b2s[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]       <span class="hljs-number">0x7fffffffc940</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Therefore, the implicit <code>static_cast</code> done there did correctly calculate the offset from the full <code>D</code> data structure at 0x7fffffffc930 to the <code>B2</code> like one which is at 0x7fffffffc940. We also infer that what lies between 0x7fffffffc930 and 0x7fffffffc940 is likely be the <code>B1</code> data and vtable.</p>
<p>Then, on the downcast sections, it is now easy to understand how the invalid ones fail and why:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>static_cast&lt;D*&gt;(b2s[0])            0x7fffffffc910</code>: the compiler just went up 0x10 at compile time bytes to try and go from a <code>B2</code> to the containing <code>D</code></p>
<p>But because <code>b2s[0]</code> was not a <code>D</code>, it now points to an undefined memory region.</p>
<p>The disassembly is:</p>

<p>so we see that GCC does:</p>

<p>First there is a NULL check, and it returns NULL if th einput is NULL.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it sets up some arguments in the RDX, RSI and RDI and calls <code>__dynamic_cast</code>.</p>
<p>I don't have the patience to analyze this further now, but as others said, the only way for this to work is for <code>__dynamic_cast</code> to access some extra RTTI in-memory data structures that represent the class hierarchy.</p>
<p>It must therefore start from the <code>B2</code> entry for that table, then walk this class hierarchy until it finds that the vtable for a <code>D</code> typecast from <code>b2s[0]</code>.</p>
<p>This is why dynamic cast is potentially expensive! Here is <a href="https://gem5-review.googlesource.com/c/public/gem5/+/25964" rel="noreferrer">an example where a one liner patch converting a <code>dynamic_cast</code> to a <code>static_cast</code> in a complex project reduced runtime by 33%!</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>reinterpret_cast&lt;D*&gt;(b2s[1])           0x7fffffffc940</code> this one just believes us blindly: we said there is a <code>D</code> at address <code>b2s[1]</code>, and the compiler does no offset calculations.</p>
<p>But this is wrong, because D is actually at 0x7fffffffc930, what is at 0x7fffffffc940 is the B2-like structure inside D! So trash gets accessed.</p>
<p>We can confirm this from the horrendous <code>-O0</code> assembly that just moves the value around:</p>

<p>While other answers nicely described all differences between C++ casts, I would like to add a short note why you should not use C-style casts <code>(Type) var</code> and <code>Type(var)</code>.</p>

<p>For C++ beginners C-style casts look like being the superset operation over C++ casts (static_cast&lt;&gt;(), dynamic_cast&lt;&gt;(), const_cast&lt;&gt;(), reinterpret_cast&lt;&gt;()) and someone could prefer them over the C++ casts. In fact C-style cast is the superset and shorter to write.</p>

<p>The main problem of C-style casts is that they hide developer real intention of the cast. The C-style casts can do virtually all types of casting from normally safe casts done by static_cast&lt;&gt;() and dynamic_cast&lt;&gt;() to potentially dangerous casts like const_cast&lt;&gt;(), where const modifier can be removed so the const variables can be modified and reinterpret_cast&lt;&gt;() that can even reinterpret integer values to pointers.</p>

<p>Here is the sample.</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> a=<span class="hljs-built_in">rand</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// Random number.</span>

<span class="hljs-type">int</span>* pa1=<span class="hljs-built_in">reinterpret_cast</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-type">int</span>*&gt;(a); <span class="hljs-comment">// OK. Here developer clearly expressed he wanted to do this potentially dangerous operation.</span>

<span class="hljs-type">int</span>* pa2=<span class="hljs-built_in">static_cast</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-type">int</span>*&gt;(a); <span class="hljs-comment">// Compiler error.</span>
<span class="hljs-type">int</span>* pa3=<span class="hljs-built_in">dynamic_cast</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-type">int</span>*&gt;(a); <span class="hljs-comment">// Compiler error.</span>

<span class="hljs-type">int</span>* pa4=(<span class="hljs-type">int</span>*) a; <span class="hljs-comment">// OK. C-style cast can do such cast. The question is if it was intentional or developer just did some typo.</span>

*pa4=<span class="hljs-number">5</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// Program crashes.</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The main reason why C++ casts were added to the language was to allow a developer to clarify his intentions - why he is going to do that cast. By using C-style casts which are perfectly valid in C++ you are making your code less readable and more error prone especially for other developers who didn't create your code. So to make your code more readable and explicit you should always prefer C++ casts over C-style casts.</p>

<p>Here is a short quote from Bjarne Stroustrup's (the author of C++) book The C++ Programming Language 4th edition - page 302.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This C-style cast is far more dangerous than the named conversion operators
  because the notation is harder to spot in a large program and the kind of conversion intended by the programmer is not explicit.</p>

<p>Only line (4) compiles without error. Only <strong>reinterpret_cast</strong> can be used to convert a pointer to an object to a pointer to an any unrelated object type.</p>

<p>One this to be noted is: The <strong>dynamic_cast</strong> would fail at run-time, however on most compilers it will also fail to compile because there are no virtual functions in the struct of the pointer being casted, meaning <strong>dynamic_cast</strong> will work with only polymorphic class pointers.</p>

<p><strong>When to use C++ cast</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <strong>static_cast</strong> as the equivalent of a C-style cast that does value conversion, or when we need to explicitly up-cast a pointer from a class to its superclass.</li>
<li>Use <strong>const_cast</strong> to remove the const qualifier.  </li>
<li>Use <strong>reinterpret_cast</strong> to do unsafe conversions of pointer types to and from integer and other pointer types. Use this only if we know what we are doing and we understand the aliasing issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nice feature of <code>reinterpret_cast</code>, not mentioned in the other answers, is that it allows us to create a sort of <code>void*</code> pointer for function types. Normally, for object types one uses <code>static_cast</code> to retrieve the original type of a pointer stored in <code>void*</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp">  <span class="hljs-type">int</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">13</span>;

It does things like implicit conversions between types (such as \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;int\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;float\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, or pointer to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;void*\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;), and it can also call explicit conversion functions (or implicit ones). In many cases, explicitly stating \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;static_cast\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; isn\u0026apos;t necessary, but it\u0026apos;s important to note that the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;T(something)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; syntax is equivalent to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;(T)something\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and should be avoided (more on that later). A \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;T(something, something_else)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is safe, however, and guaranteed to call the constructor.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;static_cast\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; can also cast through inheritance hierarchies. It is unnecessary when casting upwards (towards a base class), but when casting downwards it can be used as long as it doesn\u0026apos;t cast through \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;virtual\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; inheritance. It does not do checking, however, and it is undefined behavior to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;static_cast\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; down a hierarchy to a type that isn\u0026apos;t actually the type of the object.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;const_cast\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; can be used to remove or add \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;const\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to a variable; no other C++ cast is capable of removing it (not even \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;reinterpret_cast\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;). It is important to note that modifying a formerly \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;const\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; value is only undefined if the original variable is \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;const\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;; if you use it to take the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;const\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; off a reference to something that wasn\u0026apos;t declared with \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;const\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, it is safe. This can be useful when overloading member functions based on \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;const\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, for instance. It can also be used to add \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;const\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to an object, such as to call a member function overload.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;const_cast\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; also works similarly on \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;volatile\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, though that\u0026apos;s less common.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;dynamic_cast\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; is exclusively used for handling polymorphism. You can cast a pointer or reference to any polymorphic type to any other class type (a polymorphic type has at least one virtual function, declared or inherited). You can use it for more than just casting downwards  you can cast sideways or even up another chain. The \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;dynamic_cast\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; will seek out the desired object and return it if possible. If it can\u0026apos;t, it will return \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;nullptr\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; in the case of a pointer, or throw \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;std::bad_cast\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; in the case of a reference.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;dynamic_cast\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; has some limitations, though. It doesn\u0026apos;t work if there are multiple objects of the same type in the inheritance hierarchy (the so-called \u0026apos;dreaded diamond\u0026apos;) and you aren\u0026apos;t using \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;virtual\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; inheritance. It also can only go through public inheritance - it will always fail to travel through \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;protected\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;private\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; inheritance. This is rarely an issue, however, as such forms of inheritance are rare.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;reinterpret_cast\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; is the most dangerous cast, and should be used very sparingly. It turns one type directly into another  such as casting the value from one pointer to another, or storing a pointer in an \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;int\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, or all sorts of other nasty things. Largely, the only guarantee you get with \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;reinterpret_cast\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is that normally if you cast the result back to the original type, you will get the exact same value (but \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;not\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; if the intermediate type is smaller than the original type). There are a number of conversions that \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;reinterpret_cast\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; cannot do, too. It\u0026apos;s used primarily for particularly weird conversions and bit manipulations, like turning a raw data stream into actual data, or storing data in the low bits of a pointer to aligned data.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;C-style cast\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;function-style cast\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; are casts using \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;(type)object\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;type(object)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, respectively, and are functionally equivalent.
