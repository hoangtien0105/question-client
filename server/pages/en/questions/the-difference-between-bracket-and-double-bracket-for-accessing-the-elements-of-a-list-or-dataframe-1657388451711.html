When indexing multi-dimensional structures with a single index, x[[i]] or x[i] will return the ith sequential element of x. \n\nFor lists, one generally uses [[ to select any single element, whereas [ returns a list of the selected elements. \n\nThe [[ form allows only a single element to be selected using integer or character indices, whereas [ allows indexing by vectors. Note though that for a list, the index can be a vector and each element of the vector is applied in turn to the list, the selected component, the selected component of that component, and so on. The result is still a single element.\n\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"The significant differences between the two methods are the class of the objects they return when used for extraction and whether they may accept a range of values, or just a single value during assignment.\n\nConsider the case of data extraction on the following list:\n\nfoo &lt;- list( str=&apos;R&apos;, vec=c(1,2,3), bool=TRUE )\n\n\nSay we would like to extract the value stored by bool from foo and use it inside an if() statement. This will illustrate the differences between the return values of [] and [[]] when they are used for data extraction. The [] method returns objects of class list (or data.frame if foo was a data.frame) while the [[]] method returns objects whose class is determined by the type of their values. \n\nSo, using the [] method results in the following:\n\nif( foo[ &apos;bool&apos; ] ){ print(&quot;Hi!&quot;) }\nError in if (foo[&quot;bool&quot;]) { : argument is not interpretable as logical\n\nclass( foo[ &apos;bool&apos; ] )\n[1] &quot;list&quot;\n\n\nThis is because the [] method returned a list and a list is not valid object to pass directly into an if() statement. In this case we need to use [[]] because it will return the &quot;bare&quot; object stored in &apos;bool&apos; which will have the appropriate class:\n\nif( foo[[ &apos;bool&apos; ]] ){ print(&quot;Hi!&quot;) }\n[1] &quot;Hi!&quot;\n\nclass( foo[[ &apos;bool&apos; ]] )\n[1] &quot;logical&quot;\n\n\nThe second difference is that the [] operator may be used to access a range of slots in a list or columns in a data frame while the [[]] operator is limited to accessing a single slot or column. Consider the case of value assignment using a second list, bar():\n\nbar &lt;- list( mat=matrix(0,nrow=2,ncol=2), rand=rnorm(1) )\n\n\nSay we want to overwrite the last two slots of foo with the data contained in bar. If we try to use the [[]] operator, this is what happens:\n\nfoo[[ 2:3 ]] &lt;- bar\nError in foo[[2:3]] &lt;- bar : \nmore elements supplied than there are to replace\n\n\nThis is because [[]] is limited to accessing a single element.

We can also use single bracket if we wish to return multiple elements from the list.\nConsider the following list:\n&gt;r&lt;-list(c(1:10),foo=1,far=2);\n\nNow, please note the way the list is returned when I try to display it.\nI type r and press enter.\n&gt;r\n\n#the result is:-\n\n[[1]]\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n$foo\n\n[1] 1\n\n$far\n\n[1] 2\n\nNow we will see the magic of single bracket:\n&gt;r[c(1,2,3)]\n\n#the above command will return a list with all three elements of the actual list r as below\n\n[[1]]\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n$foo\n\n[1] 1\n\n\n$far\n\n[1] 2\n\nwhich is exactly the same as when we tried to display value of r on screen, which means the usage of single bracket has returned a list, where at index 1 we have a vector of 10 elements, then we have two more elements with names foo and far.\nWe may also choose to give a single index or element name as input to the single bracket.\ne.g.,:\n&gt; r[1]\n\n[[1]]\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\nIn this example, we gave one index &quot;1&quot; and in return got a list with one element(which is an array of 10 numbers)\n&gt; r[2]\n\n$foo\n\n[1] 1\n\nIn the above example, we gave one index &quot;2&quot; and in return got a list with one element:\n&gt; r[&quot;foo&quot;];\n\n$foo\n\n[1] 1\n\nIn this example, we passed the name of one element and in return a list was returned with one element.\nYou may also pass a vector of element names like:\n&gt; x&lt;-c(&quot;foo&quot;,&quot;far&quot;)\n\n&gt; r[x];\n\n$foo\n\n[1] 1\n\n$far\n[1] 2\n\nIn this example, we passed an vector with two element names &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;far&quot;.\nIn return we got a list with two elements.\nIn short, a single bracket will always return you another list with number of elements equal to the number of elements or number of indices you pass into the single bracket.\nIn contrast, a double bracket will always return only one element.\nBefore moving to double bracket a note to be kept in mind.\nNOTE:THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THAT SINGLE BRACKET RETURNS YOU A LIST WITH AS MANY ELEMENTS AS YOU WISH WHILE A DOUBLE BRACKET WILL NEVER RETURN A LIST. RATHER A DOUBLE BRACKET WILL RETURN ONLY A SINGLE ELEMENT FROM THE LIST.\nI will site a few examples.

<p>The R Language Definition is handy for answering these types of questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-lang.html#Indexing" rel="noreferrer">http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-lang.html#Indexing</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
R has three basic indexing operators, with syntax displayed by the following examples
</p><p>
<code></code></p><pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">    x<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span>i<span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span>
    x<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span>i<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> j<span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span>
    x<span class="hljs-punctuation">[[</span>i<span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span>
    x<span class="hljs-punctuation">[[</span>i<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> j<span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span>
    x<span class="hljs-operator">$</span>a
    x<span class="hljs-operator">$</span><span class="hljs-string">"a"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>
For vectors and matrices the <code>[[</code> forms are rarely used, although they have some slight semantic differences from the <code>[</code> form (e.g. it drops any names or dimnames attribute, and that partial matching is used for character indices). When indexing multi-dimensional structures with a single index, <code>x[[i]]</code> or <code>x[i]</code> will return the <code>i</code>th sequential element of <code>x</code>. 
</p><p>
For lists, one generally uses <code>[[</code> to select any single element, whereas <code>[</code> returns a list of the selected elements. 
</p><p>
The <code>[[</code> form allows only a single element to be selected using integer or character indices, whereas <code>[</code> allows indexing by vectors. Note though that for a list, the index can be a vector and each element of the vector is applied in turn to the list, the selected component, the selected component of that component, and so on. The result is still a single element.

<p>The significant differences between the two methods are the class of the objects they return when used for extraction and whether they may accept a range of values, or just a single value during assignment.</p>

<p>Consider the case of data extraction on the following list:</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">foo <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span> str<span class="hljs-operator">=</span><span class="hljs-string">'R'</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> vec<span class="hljs-operator">=</span><span class="hljs-built_in">c</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span><span class="hljs-number">2</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span><span class="hljs-number">3</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> bool<span class="hljs-operator">=</span><span class="hljs-literal">TRUE</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Say we would like to extract the value stored by bool from foo and use it inside an <code>if()</code> statement. This will illustrate the differences between the return values of <code>[]</code> and <code>[[]]</code> when they are used for data extraction. The <code>[]</code> method returns objects of class list (or data.frame if foo was a data.frame) while the <code>[[]]</code> method returns objects whose class is determined by the type of their values. </p>

<p>So, using the <code>[]</code> method results in the following:</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span> foo<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span> <span class="hljs-string">'bool'</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">{</span> print<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-string">"Hi!"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">}</span>
Error <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>foo<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span><span class="hljs-string">"bool"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">{</span> <span class="hljs-operator">:</span> argument is not interpretable as logical

<span class="hljs-built_in">class</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span> foo<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span> <span class="hljs-string">'bool'</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-string">"list"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This is because the <code>[]</code> method returned a list and a list is not valid object to pass directly into an <code>if()</code> statement. In this case we need to use <code>[[]]</code> because it will return the "bare" object stored in 'bool' which will have the appropriate class:</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span> foo<span class="hljs-punctuation">[[</span> <span class="hljs-string">'bool'</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">{</span> print<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-string">"Hi!"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">}</span>
<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Hi!"</span>

<span class="hljs-built_in">class</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span> foo<span class="hljs-punctuation">[[</span> <span class="hljs-string">'bool'</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-string">"logical"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The second difference is that the <code>[]</code> operator may be used to access a <strong>range</strong> of slots in a list or columns in a data frame while the <code>[[]]</code> operator is limited to accessing a <strong>single</strong> slot or column. Consider the case of value assignment using a second list, <code>bar()</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">bar <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span> mat<span class="hljs-operator">=</span>matrix<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-number">0</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span>nrow<span class="hljs-operator">=</span><span class="hljs-number">2</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span>ncol<span class="hljs-operator">=</span><span class="hljs-number">2</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> rand<span class="hljs-operator">=</span>rnorm<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Say we want to overwrite the last two slots of foo with the data contained in bar. If we try to use the <code>[[]]</code> operator, this is what happens:</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">foo<span class="hljs-punctuation">[[</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span><span class="hljs-operator">:</span><span class="hljs-number">3</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> bar
Error <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> foo<span class="hljs-punctuation">[[</span><span class="hljs-number">2</span><span class="hljs-operator">:</span><span class="hljs-number">3</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> bar <span class="hljs-operator">:</span> 
more elements supplied than there are to replace
</code></pre>

<p>This is because <code>[[]]</code> is limited to accessing a single element. We need to use <code>[]</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">foo<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span><span class="hljs-operator">:</span><span class="hljs-number">3</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> bar

<p>Just adding here that <code>[[</code> also is equipped for <em>recursive indexing</em>.</p>

<p>This was hinted at in the answer by @JijoMatthew but not explored.</p>

<p>As noted in <code>?"[["</code>, syntax like <code>x[[y]]</code>, where <code>length(y) &gt; 1</code>, is interpreted as:</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">x<span class="hljs-punctuation">[[</span> y<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">[[</span> y<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span><span class="hljs-number">2</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">[[</span> y<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span><span class="hljs-number">3</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> ... <span class="hljs-punctuation">[[</span> y<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span><span class="hljs-built_in">length</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>y<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this <em>doesn't</em> change what should be your main takeaway on the difference between <code>[</code> and <code>[[</code> -- namely, that the former is used for <strong>subsetting</strong>, and the latter is used for <strong>extracting</strong> single list elements.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>To get the value 3, we can do:</p>

<p>Getting back to @JijoMatthew's answer above, recall <code>r</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">r <span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-operator">:</span><span class="hljs-number">10</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> foo<span class="hljs-operator">=</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> far<span class="hljs-operator">=</span><span class="hljs-number">2</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In particular, this explains the errors we tend to get when mis-using <code>[[</code>, namely:</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">r<span class="hljs-punctuation">[[</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-operator">:</span><span class="hljs-number">3</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span>
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error in <code>r[[1:3]]</code> : recursive indexing failed at level 2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since this code actually tried to evaluate <code>r[[1]][[2]][[3]]</code>, and the nesting of <code>r</code> stops at level one, the attempt to extract through recursive indexing failed at <code>[[2]]</code>, i.e., at level 2.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error in <code>r[[c("foo", "far")]]</code> : subscript out of bounds</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, R was looking for <code>r[["foo"]][["far"]]</code>, which doesn't exist, so we get the subscript out of bounds error.</p>

<p>It probably would be a bit more helpful/consistent if both of these errors gave the same message.</p>

<p>Both of them are ways of subsetting.
The single bracket will return a subset of the list, which in itself will be a list. i.e., It may or may not contain more than one elements.
On the other hand, a double bracket will return just a single element from the list.</p>
<p>-Single bracket will give us a list. We can also use single bracket if we wish to return multiple elements from the list.
Consider the following list:</p>

<p>which is exactly the same as when we tried to display value of r on screen, which means the usage of single bracket has returned a list, where at index 1 we have a vector of 10 elements, then we have two more elements with names foo and far.
We may also choose to give a single index or element name as input to the single bracket.
e.g.,:</p>
<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r"><span class="hljs-operator">&gt;</span> r<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span>

</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we gave one index "1" and in return got a list with one element(which is an array of 10 numbers)</p>
<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r"><span class="hljs-operator">&gt;</span> r<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span><span class="hljs-number">2</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span>

<span class="hljs-operator">$</span>foo

<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, we gave one index "2" and in return got a list with one element:</p>
<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r"><span class="hljs-operator">&gt;</span> r<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span><span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span>;

<span class="hljs-operator">$</span>foo

<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we passed the name of one element and in return a list was returned with one element.</p>
<p>You may also pass a vector of element names like:</p>
<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r"><span class="hljs-operator">&gt;</span> x<span class="hljs-operator">&lt;-</span><span class="hljs-built_in">c</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span><span class="hljs-string">"far"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>

<span class="hljs-operator">&gt;</span> r<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span>x<span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span>;

<span class="hljs-operator">$</span>foo

<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>

<span class="hljs-operator">$</span>far
<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we passed an vector with two element names "foo" and "far".</p>
<p>In return we got a list with two elements.</p>
<p>In short, a single bracket will always return you another list with number of elements equal to the number of elements or number of indices you pass into the single bracket.</p>
<p>In contrast, a double bracket will always return only one element.
Before moving to double bracket a note to be kept in mind.
<em><strong><code>NOTE:THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THAT SINGLE BRACKET RETURNS YOU A LIST WITH AS MANY ELEMENTS AS YOU WISH WHILE A DOUBLE BRACKET WILL NEVER RETURN A LIST. RATHER A DOUBLE BRACKET WILL RETURN ONLY A SINGLE ELEMENT FROM THE LIST.</code></strong></em></p>
<p>I will site a few examples. Please keep a note of the words in bold and come back to it after you are done with the examples below:</p>
<p>Double bracket will return you the actual value at the index.(It will <strong>NOT</strong> return a list)</p>
<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">  <span class="hljs-operator">&gt;</span> r<span class="hljs-punctuation">[[</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span>

<p><strong>for double brackets if we try to view more than one elements by passing a vector it will result in an error just because it was not built to cater to that need, but just to return a single element.</strong></p>

<p>To help newbies navigate through the manual fog, it might be helpful to see the <code>[[ ... ]]</code> notation as a <em>collapsing</em> function - in other words, it is when you just want to 'get the data' from a named vector, list or data frame.

<p>For yet another concrete use case, use double brackets when you want to select a data frame created by the <code>split()</code> function. If you don't know, <code>split()</code> groups a list/data frame into subsets based on a key field. It's useful if when you want to operate on multiple groups, plot them, etc.</p>

<p>The top line of the table is called the header which contains the column names. Each horizontal line afterward denotes a data row, which begins with the name of the row, and then followed by the actual data. 
Each data member of a row is called a cell.</p>

<h2>single square bracket "[]" operator</h2>

<p>To retrieve data in a cell, we would enter its row and column coordinates in the single square bracket "[]" operator. The two coordinates are separated by a comma. In other words, the coordinates begin with row position, then followed by a comma, and ends with the column position. The order is important.</p>

<p>Eg 1:- Here is the cell value from the first row, second column of mtcars.</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r"><span class="hljs-operator">&gt;</span> mtcars<span class="hljs-punctuation">[</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">]</span>

<h2>Double square bracket "[[]]" operator</h2>

<p>We reference a data frame column with the double square bracket "[[]]" operator.</p>

<p>Eg 1:- To retrieve the ninth column vector of the built-in data set mtcars, we write mtcars[[9]].</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>mtcars[[9]] 
   [1]  1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eg 2:- We can retrieve the same column vector by its name.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>mtcars[["am"]] 
   [1]  1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... </p>
</blockquote>
