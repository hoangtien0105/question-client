This happens when input begins with an embedded &apos;\\0&apos;.  Then buffer[len -1] becomes buffer[SIZE_MAX] accessing memory certainly outside the legitimate range of buffer. Something a hacker may try or found in foolishly reading UTF16 text files.  This was the state of an answer when this answer was written.

Further, it does not save any leading, separating or trailing whitespace.  Now deleted.\n[Edit due to good later answer] There are no problems with the 1 liner buffer[strcspn(buffer, &quot;\\n&quot;)] = 0; other than performance as compared to the strlen() approach.  Performance in trimming is usually not an issue given code is doing I/O - a black hole of CPU time.  Should following code need the string&apos;s length or is highly performance conscious, use this strlen() approach.

Note that strlen() does not count the terminating \\0.\n\n\nsize_t sl = strlen(NAME);\n\n\n\n\n\nLook if the string begins with or only includes one \\0 character (empty string). In this case sl would be 0 since strlen() as I said above doesn´t count the \\0 and stops at the first occurrence of it: \n\n\nif(sl == 0)\n{\n   // Skip the newline replacement process.\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck if the last character of the proper string is a newline character &apos;\\n&apos;.  If this is the case, replace \\n with a \\0. Note that index counts start at 0 so we will need to do NAME[sl - 1]:\n\n\nif(NAME[sl - 1] == &apos;\\n&apos;)\n{\n   NAME[sl - 1] = &apos;\\0&apos;;\n}\n\n\nNote if you only pressed Enter at the fgets() string request (the string content was only consisted of a newline character) the string in NAME will be an empty string thereafter.\n\n\n\n\nWe can combine step 2. and 3. together in just one if-statement by using the logic operator &amp;&amp;:\n\n\nif(sl &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; NAME[sl - 1] == &apos;\\n&apos;)\n{\n   NAME[sl - 1] = &apos;\\0&apos;;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nThe finished code:\n\n\nsize_t sl = strlen(NAME);\nif(sl &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; NAME[sl - 1] == &apos;\\n&apos;)\n{\n   NAME[sl - 1] = &apos;\\0&apos;;\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf you rather like a function for use this technique by handling fgets output strings in general without retyping each and every time, here is fgets_newline_kill:\n\nvoid fgets_newline_kill(char a[])\n{\n    size_t sl = strlen(a);\n\n    if(sl &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; a[sl - 1] == &apos;\\n&apos;)\n    {\n       a[sl - 1] = &apos;\\0&apos;;\n    }\n}\n\n\nIn your provided example, it would be:\n\nprintf(&quot;Enter your Name: &quot;);\n\nif (fgets(Name, sizeof Name, stdin) == NULL) {\n    fprintf(stderr, &quot;Error reading Name.\\n&quot;);\n    exit(1);\n}\nelse {\n    fgets_newline_kill(NAME);\n}\n\n\nNote that this method does not work if the input string has embedded \\0s in it. If that would be the case strlen() would only return the amount of characters until the first \\0.

<p>I am trying to get some data from the user and send it to another function in gcc. The code is something like this.</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-built_in">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Enter your Name: "</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!(fgets(Name, <span class="hljs-keyword">sizeof</span> Name, <span class="hljs-built_in">stdin</span>) != <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span>)) {

    <span class="hljs-built_in">exit</span>(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>);
}

<p>However, I find that it has a newline <code>\n</code> character in the end. So if I enter <code>John</code> it ends up sending <code>John\n</code>. How do I remove that <code>\n</code> and send a proper string.</p>

<p>Perhaps the simplest solution uses one of my favorite little-known functions, <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=strcspn&amp;sektion=3" rel="noreferrer" title="strcspn manpage"><code>strcspn()</code></a>:</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c">buffer[<span class="hljs-built_in">strcspn</span>(buffer, <span class="hljs-string">"\n"</span>)] = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;

<p>If you want it to also handle <code>'\r'</code> (say, if the stream is binary):</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c">buffer[<span class="hljs-built_in">strcspn</span>(buffer, <span class="hljs-string">"\r\n"</span>)] = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// works for LF, CR, CRLF, LFCR, ...</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The function counts the number of characters until it hits a <code>'\r'</code> or a <code>'\n'</code> (in other words, it finds the first <code>'\r'</code> or <code>'\n'</code>). If it doesn't hit anything, it stops at the <code>'\0'</code> (returning the length of the string).</p>

<p>Note that this works fine even if there is no newline, because <code>strcspn</code> stops at a <code>'\0'</code>. In that case, the entire line is simply replacing <code>'\0'</code> with <code>'\0'</code>.</p>

<p>Below is a fast approach to remove a potential <code>'\n'</code> from a string saved by <code>fgets()</code>.<br>
It uses <code>strlen()</code>, with 2 tests.</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-type">char</span> buffer[<span class="hljs-number">100</span>];
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (fgets(buffer, <span class="hljs-keyword">sizeof</span> buffer, <span class="hljs-built_in">stdin</span>) != <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span>) {

  <span class="hljs-type">size_t</span> len = <span class="hljs-built_in">strlen</span>(buffer);
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (len &gt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span> &amp;&amp; buffer[len<span class="hljs-number">-1</span>] == <span class="hljs-string">'\n'</span>) {
    buffer[--len] = <span class="hljs-string">'\0'</span>;
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Now use <code>buffer</code> and <code>len</code> as needed.</p>

<p>This method has the side benefit of a <code>len</code> value for subsequent code.  It can be easily faster than <code>strchr(Name, '\n')</code>.  <a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/a/67844/29485">Ref</a>  YMMV, but both methods work.</p>

<hr>

<p><code>buffer</code>, from the original <code>fgets()</code> will not contain in <code>"\n"</code> under some circumstances:<br>
A) The line was too long for <code>buffer</code> so only <code>char</code> preceding the <code>'\n'</code> is saved in <code>buffer</code>. The unread characters remain in the stream.<br>
B) The last line in the file did not end with a <code>'\n'</code>.  </p>

<p>If input has embedded null characters <code>'\0'</code> in it somewhere, the length reported by <code>strlen()</code> will not include the <code>'\n'</code> location.</p>

<hr>

<p>Some other answers' issues: </p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>strtok(buffer, "\n");</code> fails to remove the <code>'\n'</code> when <code>buffer</code> is <code>"\n"</code>.  From this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/2693826/2410359">answer</a> - amended after this answer to warn of this limitation. </p></li>
<li><p>The following fails on rare occasions when the first <code>char</code> read by <code>fgets()</code> is <code>'\0'</code>.  This happens when input begins with an embedded <code>'\0'</code>.  Then <code>buffer[len -1]</code> becomes <code>buffer[SIZE_MAX]</code> accessing memory certainly outside the legitimate range of <code>buffer</code>. Something a hacker may try or found in foolishly reading UTF16 text files.  This was the state of an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/2693827/2410359">answer</a> when this answer was written.  Later a non-OP edited it to include code like this answer's check for <code>""</code>.</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-type">size_t</span> len = <span class="hljs-built_in">strlen</span>(buffer);
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (buffer[len - <span class="hljs-number">1</span>] == <span class="hljs-string">'\n'</span>) {  <span class="hljs-comment">// FAILS when len == 0</span>
  buffer[len <span class="hljs-number">-1</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">'\0'</span>;
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><code>sprintf(buffer,"%s",buffer);</code> is undefined behavior: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1283354/is-sprintfbuffer-s-buffer-safe">Ref</a>.  Further, it does not save any leading, separating or trailing whitespace.  Now <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/23695411/2410359">deleted</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>[Edit due to good later <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/28462221/2410359">answer</a>] There are no problems with the 1 liner <code>buffer[strcspn(buffer, "\n")] = 0;</code> other than performance as compared to the <code>strlen()</code> approach.  Performance in trimming is usually not an issue given code is doing I/O - a black hole of CPU time.  Should following code need the string's length or is highly performance conscious, use this <code>strlen()</code> approach.  Else the <code>strcspn()</code> is a fine alternative.</p></li>

<p>The steps to remove the newline character in the perhaps most obvious way:</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine the length of the string inside <code>NAME</code> by using <code>strlen()</code>, header <code>string.h</code>. Note that <code>strlen()</code> does not count the terminating <code>\0</code>.</li>
</ol>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-type">size_t</span> sl = <span class="hljs-built_in">strlen</span>(NAME);
</code></pre>

<hr>

<ol start="2">
<li>Look if the string begins with or only includes one <code>\0</code> character (empty string). In this case <code>sl</code> would be <code>0</code> since <code>strlen()</code> as I said above doesn´t count the <code>\0</code> and stops at the first occurrence of it: </li>
</ol>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(sl == <span class="hljs-number">0</span>)
{
   <span class="hljs-comment">// Skip the newline replacement process.</span>
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<ol start="3">
<li>Check if the last character of the proper string is a newline character <code>'\n'</code>.  If this is the case, replace <code>\n</code> with a <code>\0</code>. Note that index counts start at <code>0</code> so we will need to do <code>NAME[sl - 1]</code>:</li>

}

<p>Note if you only pressed Enter at the <code>fgets()</code> string request (the string content was only consisted of a newline character) the string in <code>NAME</code> will be an empty string thereafter.</p>

    {
       a[sl - <span class="hljs-number">1</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">'\0'</span>;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In your provided example, it would be:</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-built_in">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Enter your Name: "</span>);

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (fgets(Name, <span class="hljs-keyword">sizeof</span> Name, <span class="hljs-built_in">stdin</span>) == <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-built_in">fprintf</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">stderr</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Error reading Name.\n"</span>);
    <span class="hljs-built_in">exit</span>(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>);
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
    fgets_newline_kill(NAME);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this method does not work if the input string has embedded <code>\0</code>s in it. If that would be the case <code>strlen()</code> would only return the amount of characters until the first <code>\0</code>. But this isn´t quite a common approach, since the most string-reading functions usually stop at the first <code>\0</code> and take the string until that null character.</p>

<p>Aside from the question on its own. Try to avoid double negations that make your code unclearer: <code>if (!(fgets(Name, sizeof Name, stdin) != NULL) {}</code>. You can simply do <code>if (fgets(Name, sizeof Name, stdin) == NULL) {}</code>.</p>

<p>In general, rather than trimming data that you don't want, avoid writing it in the first place.  If you don't want the newline in the buffer, don't use fgets.  Instead, use <code>getc</code> or <code>fgetc</code> or <code>scanf</code>.  Perhaps something like:</p>

<p>Note that this particular approach will leave the newline unread, so you may want to use a format string like <code>"%255[^\n]%*c"</code> to discard it (eg, <code>sprintf(fmt, "%%%zd[^\n]%%*c", sizeof Name - 1);</code>), or perhaps follow the scanf with a <code>getchar()</code>.</p>

<p>Tim Čas one liner is amazing for strings obtained by a call to fgets, because you know they contain a single newline at the end. </p>

<p>If you are in a different context and want to handle strings that may contain more than one newline, you might be looking for strrspn. It is not POSIX, meaning you will not find it on all Unices. I wrote one for my own needs.</p>
