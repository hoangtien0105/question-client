However, the insert iterator in question is guaranteed to remain valid, i.e. you can safely continue the sequence of insertions. There&apos;s no need to worry about triggering vector reallocation at all.\n\nThis, again, applies only to insertions performed through the insert iterator itself. If iterator-invalidating event is triggered by some independent action on the container, then the insert iterator becomes invalidated as well in accordance with the general rules.\n\nFor example, this code\n\nstd::vector&lt;int&gt; v(10);\nstd::vector&lt;int&gt;::iterator it = v.begin() + 5;\nstd::insert_iterator&lt;std::vector&lt;int&gt; &gt; it_ins(v, it);\n\nfor (unsigned n = 20; n &gt; 0; --n)\n  *it_ins++ = rand();\n\n\nis guaranteed to perform a valid sequence of insertions into the vector, even if the vector &quot;decides&quot; to reallocate somewhere in the middle of this process. Iterator it will obviously become invalid, but it_ins will continue to remain valid.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Since this question draws so many votes and kind of becomes an FAQ, I guess it would be better to write a separate answer to mention one significant difference between C++03 and C++11 regarding the impact of std::vector&apos;s insertion operation on the validity of iterators and references with respect to reserve() and capacity(), which the most upvoted answer failed to notice.\n\nC++ 03:\n\n\n  Reallocation invalidates all the references, pointers, and iterators\n  referring to the elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that no\n  reallocation takes place during insertions that happen after a call to\n  reserve() until the time when an insertion would make the size of the\n  vector greater than the size specified in the most recent call to\n  reserve().\n\n\nC++11:\n\n\n  Reallocation invalidates all the references, pointers, and iterators\n  referring to the elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that no\n  reallocation takes place during insertions that happen after a call to\n  reserve() until the time when an insertion would make the size of the\n  vector greater than the value of capacity().\n\n\nSo in C++03, it is not &quot;unless the new container size is greater than the previous capacity (in which case all iterators and references are invalidated)&quot; as mentioned in the other answer, instead, it should be &quot;greater than the size specified in the most recent call to reserve()&quot;. This is one thing that C++03 differs from C++11. In C++03, once an insert() causes the size of the vector to reach the value specified in the previous reserve() call (which could well be smaller than the current capacity() since a reserve() could result a bigger capacity() than asked for), any subsequent insert() could cause reallocation and invalidate all the iterators and references. In C++11, this won&apos;t happen and you can always trust capacity() to know with certainty that the next reallocation won&apos;t take place before the size overpasses capacity().\n\nIn conclusion, if you are working with a C++03 vector and you want to make sure a reallocation won&apos;t happen when you perform insertion, it&apos;s the value of the argument you previously passed to reserve() that you should check the size against, not the return value of a call to capacity(), otherwise you may get yourself surprised at a &quot;premature&quot; reallocation.\n

<h2>Note 3</h2>

<p>Other than the above caveat regarding <code>swap()</code>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6440392/end-iterator-invalidation-rules">it's not clear whether "end" iterators are subject to the above listed per-container rules</a>; you should assume, anyway, that they are.</p>

<h2>Note 4</h2>

<p><code>vector</code> and all <em>unordered associative containers</em> support <code>reserve(n)</code> which guarantees that no automatic resizing will occur at least until the size of the container grows to <code>n</code>. Caution should be taken with <em>unordered associative containers</em> because a future proposal will allow the specification of a minimum load factor, which would allow rehashing to occur on <code>insert</code> after enough <code>erase</code> operations reduce the container size below the minimum; the guarantee should be considered potentially void after an <code>erase</code>.</p>

<h1>Insertion</h1>
<p><em>Sequence Containers</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>vector</code>:  The functions <code>insert</code>, <code>emplace_back</code>, <code>emplace</code>, <code>push_back</code> cause reallocation if the new size is greater than the old capacity. Reallocation invalidates all the references, pointers, and iterators referring to the elements in the sequence. If no reallocation
happens, all the iterators and references before the insertion point remain valid. [26.3.11.5/1]<br>
With respect to the <code>reserve</code> function, reallocation invalidates all the references, pointers, and iterators referring to the elements in the sequence. No reallocation shall take place during insertions that happen after a call to <code>reserve()</code> until the time when an insertion would make the size of the vector greater than the value of <code>capacity()</code>. [26.3.11.3/6]</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>deque</code>: An insertion in the middle of the deque invalidates all the iterators and references to elements of the deque. An insertion at either end of the deque invalidates all the iterators to the deque, but has no effect on the validity of references to elements of the deque. [26.3.8.4/1]</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>list</code>: Does not affect the validity of iterators and references. If an exception is thrown there are no effects. [26.3.10.4/1].<br>
The <code>insert</code>, <code>emplace_front</code>, <code>emplace_back</code>, <code>emplace</code>, <code>push_front</code>, <code>push_back</code> functions are covered under this rule.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>forward_list</code>: None of the overloads of <code>insert_after</code> shall affect the validity of iterators and references [26.3.9.5/1]</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>array</code>: <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/array#Iterator_invalidation" rel="noreferrer">As a rule</a>, iterators to an array are never invalidated throughout the lifetime of the array. One should take note, however, that during swap, the iterator will continue to point to the same array element, and will thus change its value.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>All Unordered Associative Containers</code>: Rehashing invalidates iterators, changes ordering between elements, and changes which buckets elements appear in, but does not invalidate pointers or references to elements. [26.2.7/9]<br>
The <code>insert</code> and <code>emplace</code> members shall not affect the validity of references to container elements, but may invalidate all iterators to the container. [26.2.7/14]<br>
The <code>insert</code> and <code>emplace</code> members shall not affect the validity of iterators if <code>(N+n) &lt;= z * B</code>, where <code>N</code> is the number of elements in the container prior to the insert operation, <code>n</code> is the number of elements inserted, <code>B</code> is the containers bucket count, and <code>z</code> is the containers maximum load factor. [26.2.7/15]</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>All Unordered Associative Containers</code>: In case of a merge operation  (e.g., <code>a.merge(a2)</code>), iterators referring to the transferred elements and all iterators referring to <code>a</code> will be invalidated, but iterators to elements remaining in <code>a2</code> will remain valid.

</li>
<li><p><code>deque</code>: An erase operation that erases the last element of a <code>deque</code> invalidates only the past-the-end iterator and all iterators and references to the erased elements. An erase operation that erases the first element of a <code>deque</code> but not the last element invalidates only iterators and references to the erased elements.

<p>It is probably worth adding that an insert iterator of any kind (<code>std::back_insert_iterator</code>, <code>std::front_insert_iterator</code>, <code>std::insert_iterator</code>) is guaranteed to remain valid as long as all insertions are performed through this iterator and no other independent iterator-invalidating event occurs.</p>

<p>For example, when you are performing a series of insertion operations into a <code>std::vector</code> by using <code>std::insert_iterator</code> it is quite possible that these insertions will trigger vector reallocation, which will invalidate all iterators that "point" into that vector. However, the insert iterator in question is guaranteed to remain valid, i.e. you can safely continue the sequence of insertions. There's no need to worry about triggering vector reallocation at all.</p>

<p>This, again, applies only to insertions performed through the insert iterator itself. If iterator-invalidating event is triggered by some independent action on the container, then the insert iterator becomes invalidated as well in accordance with the general rules.</p>

<p>For example, this code</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-function">std::vector&lt;<span class="hljs-type">int</span>&gt; <span class="hljs-title">v</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-number">10</span>)</span></span>;
std::vector&lt;<span class="hljs-type">int</span>&gt;::iterator it = v.<span class="hljs-built_in">begin</span>() + <span class="hljs-number">5</span>;
std::insert_iterator&lt;std::vector&lt;<span class="hljs-type">int</span>&gt; &gt; <span class="hljs-built_in">it_ins</span>(v, it);

<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-type">unsigned</span> n = <span class="hljs-number">20</span>; n &gt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; --n)
  *it_ins++ = <span class="hljs-built_in">rand</span>();
</code></pre>

<p>is guaranteed to perform a valid sequence of insertions into the vector, even if the vector "decides" to reallocate somewhere in the middle of this process. Iterator <code>it</code> will obviously become invalid, but <code>it_ins</code> will continue to remain valid.</p>

<p>Since this question draws so many votes and kind of becomes an FAQ, I guess it would be better to write a separate answer to mention one significant difference between C++03 and C++11 regarding the impact of <code>std::vector</code>'s insertion operation on the validity of iterators and references with respect to <code>reserve()</code> and <code>capacity()</code>, which the most upvoted answer failed to notice.</p>

<p>C++ 03:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reallocation invalidates all the references, pointers, and iterators
  referring to the elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that no
  reallocation takes place during insertions that happen after a call to
  reserve() until the time when an insertion would make the size of the
  vector <strong>greater than the size specified in the most recent call to
  reserve()</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>C++11:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reallocation invalidates all the references, pointers, and iterators
  referring to the elements in the sequence. It is guaranteed that no
  reallocation takes place during insertions that happen after a call to
  reserve() until the time when an insertion would make the size of the
  vector <strong>greater than the value of capacity()</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in C++03, it is not "<code>unless the new container size is greater than the previous capacity (in which case all iterators and references are invalidated)</code>" as mentioned in the other answer, instead, it should be "<code>greater than the size specified in the most recent call to reserve()</code>". This is one thing that C++03 differs from C++11. In C++03, once an <code>insert()</code> causes the size of the vector to reach the value specified in the previous <code>reserve()</code> call (which could well be smaller than the current <code>capacity()</code> since a <code>reserve()</code> could result a bigger <code>capacity()</code> than asked for), any subsequent <code>insert()</code> could cause reallocation and invalidate all the iterators and references. In C++11, this won't happen and you can always trust <code>capacity()</code> to know with certainty that the next reallocation won't take place before the size overpasses <code>capacity()</code>.</p>

<p>In conclusion, if you are working with a C++03 vector and you want to make sure a reallocation won't happen when you perform insertion, it's the value of the argument you previously passed to <code>reserve()</code> that you should check the size against, not the return value of a call to <code>capacity()</code>, otherwise you may get yourself surprised at a "<em>premature</em>" reallocation.</p>

In C++03, once an \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;insert()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; causes the size of the vector to reach the value specified in the previous \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;reserve()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; call (which could well be smaller than the current \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;capacity()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; since a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;reserve()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; could result a bigger \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;capacity()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; than asked for), any subsequent \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;insert()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; could cause reallocation and invalidate all the iterators and references. In C++11, this won\u0026apos;t happen and you can always trust \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;capacity()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to know with certainty that the next reallocation won\u0026apos;t take place before the size overpasses \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;capacity()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In conclusion, if you are working with a C++03 vector and you want to make sure a reallocation won\u0026apos;t happen when you perform insertion, it\u0026apos;s the value of the argument you previously passed to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;reserve()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; that you should check the size against, not the return value of a call to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;capacity()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, otherwise you may get yourself surprised at a \u0026quot;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;premature\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026quot; reallocation.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Here is a nice summary table from \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container#Iterator_invalidation\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;cppreference.com\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/qgST0.png\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/qgST0.png\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;enter image description here\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Here, \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;insertion\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; refers to any method which adds one or more elements to the container and \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;erasure\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; refers to any method which removes one or more elements from the container.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    "],"id":304,"title":"Iterator invalidation rules for C++ containers","content":"\n                    \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;\n            \u0026lt;aside class=\u0026quot;s-notice s-notice__info post-notice js-post-notice mb16\u0026quot; role=\u0026quot;status\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\n        \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;d-flex fd-column fw-nowrap\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\n            \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;d-flex fw-nowrap\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\n                    \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;flex--item mr8\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\n                        \u0026lt;svg aria-hidden=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;svg-icon iconLock\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;18\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;18\u0026quot; viewBox=\u0026quot;0 0 18 18\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;path d=\u0026quot;M16 9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2V6A5 5 0 0 0 4 6v1a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v6c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h10a2 2 0 0 0 2-2V9Zm-7 5a2 2 0 1 1 0-4 2 2 0 0 1 0 4Zm3.1-7H5.9V6a3.1 3.1 0 0 1 6.2 0v1Z\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/path\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/svg\u0026gt;\n                    \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;\n                \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;flex--item wmn0 fl1 lh-lg\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\n                    \u0026lt;div class=\u0026quot;flex--item fl1 lh-lg\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\n                        \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;This question\u0026apos;s answers are a \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;/help/privileges/edit-community-wiki\u0026quot;\u0026gt;community effort\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;.
