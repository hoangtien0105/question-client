  This is meant to be a canonical question/answer that can be used as a

Scanner seems like a &quot;simple&quot; class to use, and that is where the first mistake is made. It is not simple, it has all kinds of non-obvious side effect and aberrant behaviors that break the Principle of Least Astonishment in very subtle ways. 

So this might seem to be overkill for this class, but the peeling the onions errors and problems are all simple, but taken together they are very complex because of their interactions and side effects. This is why there are so many questions about it on Stack Overflow every day. 

Common Scanner questions:

Most Scanner questions include failed attempts at more than one of these things.


I want to be able to have my program automatically wait for the next input after each previous input as well.
I want to know how to detect an exit command and end my program when that command is entered.
I want to know how to match multiple commands for the exit command in a case-insensitive way.
I want to be able to match regular expression patterns as well as the built-in primitives. For example, how to match what appears to be a date ( 2014/10/18 )?
I want to know how to match things that might not easily be implemented with regular expression matching - for example, an URL ( http://google.com ).


Motivation:

In the Java world, Scanner is a special case, it is an extremely finicky class that teachers should not give new students instructions to use. In most cases the instructors do not even know how to use it correctly. It is hardly if ever used in professional production code so its value to students is extremely questionable.

Using Scanner implies all the other things this question and answer mentions. It is never just about Scanner it is about how to solve these common problems with Scanner that are always co morbid problems in almost all the question that get Scanner wrong. It is never just about next() vs nextLine(), that is just a symptom of the finickiness of the implementation of the class, there are always other issues in the code posting in questions asking about Scanner.

The answer shows a complete, idiomatic implementation of 99% of cases where Scanner is used and asked about on StackOverflow.

Especially in beginner code. If you think this answer is too complex then complain to the instructors that tell new students to use Scanner before explaining the intricacies, quirks, non-obvious side effects and peculiarities of its behavior.

Scanner is the a great teaching moment about how important the Principle of least astonishment is and why consistent behavior and semantics are important in naming methods and method arguments.

Note to students:


  You will probably never actually see Scanner used in
  professional/commercial line of business apps because everything it
  does is done better by something else. Real world software has to be
  more resilient and maintainable than Scanner allows you to write
  code. Real world software uses standardized file format parsers and
  documented file formats, not the adhoc input formats that you are
  given in stand alone assignments.

It tries to illustrate what idiomatic Java code\n  should look like and behave like.\n\n\nBelow are some of the things I was thinking about when I wrote this example:\n\nJDK Version:\n\nI purposely kept this example compatible with JDK 6. If some scenario really demands a feature of JDK 7/8 I or someone else will post a new answer with specifics about how to modify this for that version JDK.\n\nThe majority of questions about this class come from students and they usually have restrictions on what they can use to solve a problem so I restricted this as much as I could to show how to do the common things without any other dependencies. In the 22+ years I have been working with Java and consulting the majority of that time I have never encountered professional use of this class in the 10&apos;s of millions of lines source code I have seen.\n\nProcessing commands:\n\nThis shows exactly how to idiomatically read commands from the user interactively and dispatch those commands. The majority of questions about java.util.Scanner are of the how can I get my program to quit when I enter some specific input category. This shows that clearly.\n\nNaive Dispatcher\n\nThe dispatch logic is intentionally naive so as to not complicate the solution for new readers. A dispatcher based on a Strategy Pattern or Chain Of Responsibility pattern would be more appropriate for real world problems that would be much more complex.\n\nError Handling\n\nThe code was deliberately structured as to require no Exception handling because there is no scenario where some data might not be correct.\n\n.hasNext() and .hasNextXxx()\n\nI rarely see anyone using the .hasNext() properly, by testing for the generic .hasNext() to control the event loop, and then using the if(.hasNextXxx()) idiom lets you decide how and what to proceed with your code without having to worry about asking for an int when none is available, thus no exception handling code.\n\n.nextXXX() vs .nextLine()\n\nThis is something that breaks everyone&apos;s code. It is a finicky detail that should not have to be dealt with and has a very obfusated bug that is hard to reason about because of it breaks the Principal of Least Astonishment\n\nThe .nextXXX() methods do not consume the line ending. .nextLine() does.\n\nThat means that calling .nextLine() immediately after .nextXXX() will just return the line ending. You have to call it again to actually get the next line.\n\nThis is why many people advocate either use nothing but the .nextXXX() methods or only .nextLine() but not both at the same time so that this finicky behavior does not trip you up. Personally I think the type safe methods are much better than having to then test and parse and catch errors manually.\n\nImmutablity:\n\nNotice that there are no mutable variables used in the code, this is important to learn how to do, it eliminates four of the most major sources of runtime errors and subtle bugs.\n\n\nNo nulls means no possibility of a  NullPointerExceptions!\nNo mutability means that you don&apos;t have to worry about method arguments changing or anything else changing. When you step debug through you never have to use watch to see what variables are change to what values, if they are changing. This makes the logic 100% deterministic when you read it.\nNo mutability means your code is automatically thread-safe.\nNo side effects. If nothing can change, the you don&apos;t have to worry about some subtle side effect of some edge case changing something unexpectedly!\n\n\nRead this if you don&apos;t understand how to apply the final keyword in your own code.\n\nUsing a Set instead of massive switch or if/elseif blocks:\n\nNotice how I use a Set&lt;String&gt; and use .contains() to classify the commands instead of a massive switch or if/elseif monstrosity that would bloat your code and more importantly make maintenance a nightmare! Adding a new overloaded command is as simple as adding a new String to the array in the constructor.\n\nThis also would work very well with i18n and i10n and the proper ResourceBundles.\nA Map&lt;Locale,Set&lt;String&gt;&gt; would let you have multiple language support with very little overhead!\n\n@Nonnull\n\nI have decided that all my code should explicitly declare if something is @Nonnull or @Nullable. It lets your IDE help warn you about potential NullPointerException hazards and when you do not have to check.\n\nMost importantly it documents the expectation for future readers that none of these method parameters should be null.\n\nCalling .close()\n\nReally think about this one before you do it.\n\nWhat do you think will happen System.in if you were to call sis.close()? See the comments in the listing above.\n\nPlease fork and send pull requests and I will update this question and answer for other basic usage scenarios.\n

<p>Scanner seems like a <em>"simple"</em> class to use, and that is where the first mistake is made. It is not simple, it has all kinds of non-obvious side effect and aberrant behaviors that break the <em>Principle of Least Astonishment</em> in very subtle ways. </p>

<p>So this might seem to be overkill for this class, but the peeling the onions errors and problems are all <em>simple</em>, but taken together they are very <em>complex</em> because of their interactions and side effects. This is why there are so many questions about it on Stack Overflow every day. </p>

<h3>Common Scanner questions:</h3>

<p>Most <code>Scanner</code> questions include failed attempts at more than one of these things.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I want to be able to have my program automatically wait for the next input after each previous input as well.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to know how to detect an <em>exit</em> command and end my program when that command is entered.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to know how to match multiple commands for the <em>exit</em> command in a case-insensitive way.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to be able to match regular expression patterns as well as the built-in primitives. For example, how to match what appears to be a date ( <code>2014/10/18</code> )?</p></li>
<li><p>I want to know how to match things that might not easily be implemented with regular expression matching - for example, an URL ( <code>http://google.com</code> ).</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Motivation:</h3>

<p>In the Java world, <code>Scanner</code> is a special case, it is an extremely finicky class that teachers should not give new students instructions to use. In most cases the instructors do not even know how to use it correctly. It is hardly if ever used in professional production code so its value to students is extremely questionable.</p>

<p>Using <code>Scanner</code> implies all the other things this question and answer mentions. It is never just about <code>Scanner</code> it is about how to solve these common problems with <code>Scanner</code> that are always co morbid problems in almost all the question that get <code>Scanner</code> wrong. It is never just about <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13102045/scanner-is-skipping-nextline-after-using-next-or-nextfoo"><code>next()</code> vs <code>nextLine()</code></a>, that is just a symptom of the finickiness of the implementation of the class, there are always other issues in the code posting in questions asking about <code>Scanner</code>.</p>

<p>The answer shows a complete, idiomatic implementation of 99% of cases where <code>Scanner</code> is used and asked about on StackOverflow.</p>

<p>Especially in beginner code. If you think this answer is too complex then complain to the instructors that tell new students to use <code>Scanner</code> before explaining the intricacies, quirks, non-obvious side effects and peculiarities of its behavior.</p>

<p><code>Scanner</code> is the a great teaching moment about how important the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment" rel="noreferrer">Principle of least astonishment</a> is and why consistent behavior and semantics are important in naming methods and method arguments.</p>

<h3>Note to students:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>You will probably never actually see <code>Scanner</code> used in
  professional/commercial line of business apps because everything it
  does is done better by something else. Real world software has to be
  more resilient and maintainable than <code>Scanner</code> allows you to write
  code. Real world software uses standardized file format parsers and
  documented file formats, not the <em>adhoc</em> input formats that you are
  given in stand alone assignments.</p>

<h2>Idiomatic Example:</h2>

<p>The following is how to properly use the <code>java.util.Scanner</code> class to interactively read user input from <code>System.in</code> correctly( sometimes referred to as <code>stdin</code>, especially in C, C++ and other languages as well as in Unix and Linux). It idiomatically demonstrates the most common things that are requested to be done.</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>This may look like a lot of code, but it illustrates the minimum
  effort needed to use the <code>Scanner</code> class correctly and not have to
  deal with subtle bugs and side effects that plague those new to
  programming and this terribly implemented class called
  <code>java.util.Scanner</code>. It tries to illustrate what idiomatic Java code
  should look like and behave like.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Below are some of the things I was thinking about when I wrote this example:</em></p>

<h3>JDK Version:</h3>

<p>I purposely kept this example compatible with JDK 6. If some scenario really demands a feature of JDK 7/8 I or someone else will post a new answer with specifics about how to modify this for that version JDK.</p>

<p>The majority of questions about this class come from students and they usually have restrictions on what they can use to solve a problem so I restricted this as much as I could to show how to do the common things without any other dependencies. <em>In the 22+ years I have been working with Java and consulting the majority of that time I have never encountered professional use of this class in the 10's of millions of lines source code I have seen.</em></p>

<h3>Processing commands:</h3>

<p>This shows exactly how to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiom_(language_structure)" rel="noreferrer">idiomatically</a> read commands from the user interactively and dispatch those commands. The majority of questions about <code>java.util.Scanner</code> are of the <em>how can I get my program to quit when I enter some specific input</em> category. This shows that clearly.</p>

<h3>Naive Dispatcher</h3>

<p>The dispatch logic is intentionally naive so as to not complicate the solution for new readers. A dispatcher based on a <code>Strategy Pattern</code> or <code>Chain Of Responsibility</code> pattern would be more appropriate for real world problems that would be much more complex.</p>

<h3>Error Handling</h3>

<p>The code was deliberately structured as to require no <code>Exception</code> handling because there is no scenario where some data might not be correct.</p>

<h3><code>.hasNext()</code> and <code>.hasNextXxx()</code></h3>

<p>I rarely see anyone using the <code>.hasNext()</code> properly, by testing for the generic <code>.hasNext()</code> to control the event loop, and then using the <code>if(.hasNextXxx())</code> idiom lets you decide how and what to proceed with your code without having to worry about asking for an <code>int</code> when none is available, thus no exception handling code.</p>

<h3><code>.nextXXX()</code> vs <code>.nextLine()</code></h3>

<p>This is something that breaks everyone's code. It is a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13102045/scanner-is-skipping-nextline-after-using-next-or-nextfoo">finicky detail</a> that should not have to be dealt with and has a very obfusated bug that is hard to reason about because of it breaks the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment" rel="noreferrer">Principal of Least Astonishment</a></p>

<p>The <code>.nextXXX()</code> methods do not consume the line ending. <code>.nextLine()</code> does.</p>

<p>That means that calling <code>.nextLine()</code> immediately after <code>.nextXXX()</code> will just return the line ending. You have to call it again to actually get the next line.</p>

<p>This is why many people advocate either use nothing but the <code>.nextXXX()</code> methods or only <code>.nextLine()</code> but not both at the same time so that this finicky behavior does not trip you up. Personally I think the type safe methods are much better than having to then test and parse and catch errors manually.</p>

<h3>Immutablity:</h3>

<p>Notice that there are no mutable variables used in the code, this is important to learn how to do, it eliminates four of the most major sources of runtime errors and subtle bugs.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>No <code>nulls</code> means no possibility of a  <code>NullPointerExceptions</code>!</p></li>
<li><p>No mutability means that you don't have to worry about method arguments changing or anything else changing. When you step debug through you never have to use <code>watch</code> to see what variables are change to what values, if they are changing. This makes the logic 100% deterministic when you read it.</p></li>
<li><p>No mutability means your code is automatically thread-safe.</p></li>
<li><p>No side effects. If nothing can change, the you don't have to worry about some subtle side effect of some edge case changing something unexpectedly!</p></li>
</ol>

<p><a href="http://www.vertigrated.com/blog/2011/05/the-final-word-on-final/" rel="noreferrer">Read this if you don't understand how to apply the <code>final</code> keyword in your own code.</a></p>

<h3>Using a Set instead of massive <code>switch</code> or <code>if/elseif</code> blocks:</h3>

<p>Notice how I use a <code>Set&lt;String&gt;</code> and use <code>.contains()</code> to classify the commands instead of a massive <code>switch</code> or <code>if/elseif</code> monstrosity that would bloat your code and more importantly make maintenance a nightmare! Adding a new overloaded command is as simple as adding a new <code>String</code> to the array in the constructor.</p>

<p>This also would work very well with <code>i18n</code> and <code>i10n</code> and the proper <code>ResourceBundles</code>.
A <code>Map&lt;Locale,Set&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code> would let you have multiple language support with very little overhead!</p>

<h3>@Nonnull</h3>

<p>I have decided that all my code should <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/228305/177800">explicitly</a> declare if something is <code>@Nonnull</code> or <code>@Nullable</code>. It lets your IDE help warn you about potential <code>NullPointerException</code> hazards and when you do not have to check.</p>

<p>Most importantly it documents the expectation for future readers that none of these method parameters should be <code>null</code>.</p>

<h3>Calling .close()</h3>

<p>Really think about this one before you do it.</p>
