If you run select &quot;Project&quot; -&gt; &quot;Clean...&quot; on the Eclipse\nmenu, it will remove and then regenerate the R.java file.\n\nThe problem &quot;R cannot be resolved&quot; happens when you change your\npackage name in the AndroidManifest.xml file. It uses your Android\npackage name to create a subdirectory under the &quot;gen&quot; directory where\nit stores the R.java file.\n\nEclipse may have problems executing clean, because it is confused about\nwhere the R.java file is when you have changed the Android package\nname. You can either rename the subdirectory under gen to match your\nnew package name, or you can change your package name back to the old\nname.

<p>I just downloaded and installed the new Android SDK. I wanted to create a simple application to test drive it.</p>

<p>The wizard created this code:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-scala"><span class="hljs-keyword">package</span> eu.mauriziopz.gps;

        setContentView(<span class="hljs-type">R</span>.layout.main);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_%28software%29" rel="noreferrer">Eclipse</a> gives me the error</p>

<blockquote>

<p>on line</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-scss"><span class="hljs-built_in">setContentView</span>(R.layout.main);
</code></pre>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>PS: I do have an XML file named <code>main.xml</code> under <code>res/layout/</code>.</p>

<p><a href="http://source.android.com/source/using-eclipse.html" rel="noreferrer">http://source.android.com/source/using-eclipse.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>*Note: Eclipse sometimes likes to add an "import android.R" statement at the
  top of your files that use resources,
  especially when you ask Eclipse to
  sort or otherwise manage imports. This
  will cause your <em>make</em> to break. Look
  out for these erroneous import
  statements and delete them.*</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While going through the Android sample tutorials, I would often use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd> command to "Organize Imports" and generate any missing import statements. Sometimes this would generate the incorrect import statement which would hide the <code>R.java</code> class that is automatically generated when you build.</p>

<p>then check for the <code>/res</code> directory and there must be some file that have some error in it and that is preventing the application from being built. For example, it may be a layout file or it may be due to some missing resource is, but you already defined it in the XML file.</p>

<p>If you have any additional, even unused (!) or unreferenced (!) images in a folder like res/drawables-mdpi which do not comply to the file naming conventions (may contain only [a-z0-9_.]), the R.java class might not generate, causing the chain of events all the other posts referred to.

<p>but I've found out that there was another problem that was causing the first one. The tools in the SDK directory didn't have the permissions to be executed, so it was like the didn't exist for Eclipse, thus it didn't build the <code>R.java</code> file.</p>

<p>So modifying the permission and selecting "Build Automatically" solved the problem.</p>

<p><code>R.java</code> is a file that the Android Eclipse plugins creates while
building your application. <code>R.java</code> is created under the "gen"
directory. This file is generated from the information in the "res"
directory. If you run select "Project" -&gt; "Clean..." on the Eclipse
menu, it will remove and then regenerate the <code>R.java</code> file.</p>

<p>The problem "R cannot be resolved" happens when you change your
package name in the <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file. It uses your Android
package name to create a subdirectory under the "gen" directory where
it stores the <code>R.java</code> file.</p>

<p>Eclipse may have problems executing clean, because it is confused about
where the <code>R.java</code> file is when you have changed the Android package
name. You can either rename the subdirectory under <code>gen</code> to match your
new package name, or you can change your package name back to the old
name. Do the clean and then change the package name to the new name
you want. This works best if you stop Eclipse from trying to build
while you are changing the package name. Under the "Project" menu
uncheck the option to "Build Automatically" and also when the
"Clean..." dialog asks if it should "Start a build immediately"
uncheck the box so it doesn't try to build while you are changing the
package name. After you have changed the name you can turn "Build
Automatically" back on again.</p>

<p>Note that if your <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> file package name does not match
your Java package name, Eclipse will end up automatically adding an
"import &lt;your Android package name&gt;.R;" line in all your <code>.java</code> files
that have any references to R. If you change your <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>
package name, sometimes Eclipse does not update all of these added
imports. If that happens, use the Eclipse refactoring (<kbd>ALT</kbd> +
<kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>) to change the import statement in one of your Java files to
your new <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> package name. It is best to do this
while you have disabled "Build Automatically".</p>

<ol>
<li>Right-click on your project</li>
<li>Choose Properties </li>
<li>Choose Android in the left menu </li>
<li>Tick a box next to the appropriate Project Build Target.</li>
<li>Click Apply and OK</li>

<p>Edit: A year later I found another cause.  I had a .jpg image in my drawable folder with the same name as a .png image.  Referencing this image in my code must have confused the program and it gave the "R cannot be resolved" error.  </p>

<p>Yet another reason <code>R.java</code> might not get autogenerated is if you have directories like <strong>res/drawable-hdpi</strong>, <strong>res/drawable-mdpi</strong>, or <strong>res/drawable-ldpi</strong>.  </p>

<p>1.6+ seems to be OK with these directories, but 1.5 doesn't want them. When I removed those directories, <code>R.java</code> started autogenerating for me again.</p>

<p>Often times this is because of the MinSDK version number you supplied when creating the project.  Example:</p>

<p>If you want 2.1 to be the minimum, Android 2.1 is actually API Level 7.</p>

<p>You can see what I am talking about when you browse the SDK you downloaded and installed.  Navigate to the place you installed the SDK to (<code>C:\android-sdk-windows</code> for example) and open the folder named "platforms". You will see something like "android-7" listed as a folder, and if you open that there is a <code>source.properties</code> file that, when opened with a text editor, will show you the corresponding platform version.</p>

<p>When you create a project, and you must select a "Build Target" API, the last column in that list named "API Level" shows the number you are looking for when populating the MinSDK setting.</p>

<p>This is probably one of the most common mistakes that results in the <code>R.java</code> file not being created under Project &gt; gen &gt; packagename &gt; R.java.</p>

<p>In case anyone is interested (I might be saving your life here), I had the error, <code>R.xml</code> cannot be resolved, slightly different on a GLS project. Hmmmm. After looking in <code>R.java</code>, I found an auto-generated class, <code>XML.java</code>, (I think) was not there.</p>

<p>Solution? It needed a new folder in <code>res</code>: <code>res\xml</code> and a file called <code>default_values.xml</code>
in there. Then all was OK.</p>

<p>Just in case you have not got that file, it's:</p>

<p>So I have run into this problem multiple times when switching build targets.  Usually doing a Project &gt;&gt; Clean worked for me.  This last time, however, it did not.  Finally I tried to open my default.properties file, located under the root project folder.  I received an error message stating that it was out of sync with the file system.  I actually deleted it and copied a coworkers version which allowed eclipse to rebuild my R file.  I will paste what it looks like below.  It is named 'default.properties'.</p>

It uses your Android\npackage name to create a subdirectory under the \u0026quot;gen\u0026quot; directory where\nit stores the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;R.java\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; file.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Eclipse may have problems executing clean, because it is confused about\nwhere the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;R.java\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; file is when you have changed the Android package\nname. You can either rename the subdirectory under \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;gen\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to match your\nnew package name, or you can change your package name back to the old\nname. Do the clean and then change the package name to the new name\nyou want. This works best if you stop Eclipse from trying to build\nwhile you are changing the package name. Under the \u0026quot;Project\u0026quot; menu\nuncheck the option to \u0026quot;Build Automatically\u0026quot; and also when the\n\u0026quot;Clean...\u0026quot; dialog asks if it should \u0026quot;Start a build immediately\u0026quot;\nuncheck the box so it doesn\u0026apos;t try to build while you are changing the\npackage name.

If you change your \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;AndroidManifest.xml\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\npackage name, sometimes Eclipse does not update all of these added\nimports. If that happens, use the Eclipse refactoring (\u0026lt;kbd\u0026gt;ALT\u0026lt;/kbd\u0026gt; +\n\u0026lt;kbd\u0026gt;Shift\u0026lt;/kbd\u0026gt; + \u0026lt;kbd\u0026gt;R\u0026lt;/kbd\u0026gt;) to change the import statement in one of your Java files to\nyour new \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;AndroidManifest.xml\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; package name.
