(Windows Forms, C#, .NET)

There is a main form which hosts some user control.
The user control does some heavy data operation, such that if I directly call the UserControl_Load method the UI become nonresponsive for the duration for load method execution.
To overcome this I load data on different thread (trying to change existing code as little as I can)
I used a background worker thread which will be loading the data and when done will notify the application that it has done its work.
Now came a real problem. All the UI (main form and its child usercontrols) was created on the primary main thread. In the LOAD method of the usercontrol I&#x27;m fetching data based on the values of some control (like textbox) on userControl.

The pseudocode would look like this:
CODE 1
UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod()
{
    if (textbox1.text == &quot;MyName&quot;) // This gives exception
    {
        //Load data corresponding to &quot;MyName&quot;.
        //Populate a globale variable List&lt;string&gt; which will be binded to grid at some later stage.
    }
}

The Exception it gave was

Cross-thread operation not valid: Control accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on.

To know more about this I did some googling and a suggestion came up like using the following code
CODE 2
UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod()
{
    if (InvokeRequired) // Line #1
    {
        this.Invoke(new MethodInvoker(UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod));
        return;
    }

    if (textbox1.text == &quot;MyName&quot;) // Now it won&#x27;t give an exception
    {
    //Load data correspondin to &quot;MyName&quot;
        //Populate a globale variable List&lt;string&gt; which will be binded to grid at some later stage
    }
}

But it still seems that I&#x27;ve come back to square one. The Application again
becomes unresponsive. It seems to be due to the execution of line #1 if condition. The loading task is again done by the parent thread and not the third that I spawned.
I don&#x27;t know whether I perceived this right or wrong. I&#x27;m new to threading.
How do I resolve this and also what is the effect of execution of Line#1 if block?
The situation is this: I want to load data into a global variable based on the value of a control. I don&#x27;t want to change the value of a control from the child thread. I&#x27;m not going to do it ever from a child thread.
So only accessing the value so that the corresponding data can be fetched from the database.

<p>I have a scenario. (Windows Forms, C#, .NET)</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a main form which hosts some user control.</li>
<li>The user control does some heavy data operation, such that if I directly call the <code>UserControl_Load</code> method the UI become nonresponsive for the duration for load method execution.</li>
<li>To overcome this I load data on different thread (trying to change existing code as little as I can)</li>
<li>I used a background worker thread which will be loading the data and when done will notify the application that it has done its work.</li>
<li>Now came a real problem. All the UI (main form and its child usercontrols) was created on the primary main thread. In the LOAD method of the usercontrol I'm fetching data based on the values of some control (like textbox) on userControl.</li>
</ol>
<p>The pseudocode would look like this:</p>
<p><strong>CODE 1</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-cs s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp">UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod()
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (textbox1.text == <span class="hljs-string">"MyName"</span>) <span class="hljs-comment">// This gives exception</span>
    {
        <span class="hljs-comment">//Load data corresponding to "MyName".</span>
        <span class="hljs-comment">//Populate a globale variable List&lt;string&gt; which will be binded to grid at some later stage.</span>
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The Exception it gave was</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cross-thread operation not valid: Control accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To know more about this I did some googling and a suggestion came up like using the following code</p>
<p><strong>CODE 2</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-cs s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp">UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod()
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (InvokeRequired) <span class="hljs-comment">// Line #1</span>
    {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.Invoke(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> MethodInvoker(UserContrl1_LoadDataMethod));
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span>;
    }

    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (textbox1.text == <span class="hljs-string">"MyName"</span>) <span class="hljs-comment">// Now it won't give an exception</span>
    {
    <span class="hljs-comment">//Load data correspondin to "MyName"</span>
        <span class="hljs-comment">//Populate a globale variable List&lt;string&gt; which will be binded to grid at some later stage</span>
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>But it still seems that I've come back to square one. The Application again
becomes unresponsive. It seems to be due to the execution of line #1 if condition. The loading task is again done by the parent thread and not the third that I spawned.</p>
<p>I don't know whether I perceived this right or wrong. I'm new to threading.</p>
<p>How do I resolve this and also what is the effect of execution of Line#1 if block?</p>
<p><strong>The situation is this</strong>: I want to load data into a global variable based on the value of a control. I don't want to change the value of a control from the child thread. I'm not going to do it ever from a child thread.</p>
<p>So only accessing the value so that the corresponding data can be fetched from the database.</p>

<p>As per <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/142003/cross-thread-operation-not-valid-control-accessed-from-a-thread-other-than-the#142108">Prerak K's update comment</a> (since deleted):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess I have not presented the question properly.</p>
<p>Situation is this: I want to load data into a global variable based on the value of a control. I don't want to change the value of a control from the child thread. I'm not going to do it ever from a child thread.</p>
<p>So only accessing the value so that corresponding data can be fetched from the database.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The solution you want then should look like:</p>
<pre class="lang-cs s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp">UserContrl1_LOadDataMethod()
{
    <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> name = <span class="hljs-string">""</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(textbox1.InvokeRequired)
    {
        textbox1.Invoke(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> MethodInvoker(<span class="hljs-built_in">delegate</span> { name = textbox1.text; }));
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(name == <span class="hljs-string">"MyName"</span>)
    {
        <span class="hljs-comment">// do whatever</span>
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Do your serious processing in the separate thread <em>before</em> you attempt to switch back to the control's thread. For example:</p>
<pre class="lang-cs s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp">UserContrl1_LOadDataMethod()
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(textbox1.text==<span class="hljs-string">"MyName"</span>) <span class="hljs-comment">//&lt;&lt;======Now it wont give exception**</span>
    {
        <span class="hljs-comment">//Load data correspondin to "MyName"</span>
        <span class="hljs-comment">//Populate a globale variable List&lt;string&gt; which will be</span>
        <span class="hljs-comment">//bound to grid at some later stage</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(InvokeRequired)
        {
            <span class="hljs-comment">// after we've done all the processing, </span>

<h1>Threading Model in UI</h1>

<p>Please read the <em><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wpf/advanced/threading-model" rel="noreferrer">Threading Model</a></em> in UI applications (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms741870(v=vs.100).aspx" rel="noreferrer">old VB link is here</a>) in order to understand basic concepts. The link navigates to page that describes the WPF threading model. However, Windows Forms utilizes the same idea.</p>

<h2>The UI Thread</h2>

<ul>
<li>There is only one thread (UI thread), that is allowed to access <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Windows.Forms.Control.aspx" rel="noreferrer">System.Windows.Forms.Control</a> and its subclasses members.</li>
<li>Attempt to access member of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Windows.Forms.Control.aspx" rel="noreferrer">System.Windows.Forms.Control</a> from different thread than UI thread will cause cross-thread exception.</li>
<li>Since there is only one thread, all UI operations are queued as work items into that thread:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6MtB3.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<ul>
<li>If there is no work for UI thread, then there are idle gaps that can be used by a not-UI related computing.</li>
<li>In order to use mentioned gaps use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke.aspx" rel="noreferrer">System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke</a> or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.begininvoke.aspx" rel="noreferrer">System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke</a> methods:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WQPOJ.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<h2>BeginInvoke and Invoke methods</h2>

<ul>
<li>The computing overhead of method being invoked should be small as well as computing overhead of event handler methods because the UI thread is used there - the same that is responsible for handling user input. Regardless if this is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke.aspx" rel="noreferrer">System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke</a> or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.begininvoke.aspx" rel="noreferrer">System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke</a>.</li>
<li>To perform computing expensive operation always use separate thread. Since .NET 2.0 <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.backgroundworker.aspx" rel="noreferrer">BackgroundWorker</a> is dedicated to performing computing expensive operations in Windows Forms. However in new solutions you should use the async-await pattern as described <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/18033198/2042090">here</a>.</li>
<li>Use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke.aspx" rel="noreferrer">System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke</a> or <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.begininvoke.aspx" rel="noreferrer">System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke</a> methods only to update a user interface. If you use them for heavy computations, your application will block:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UfBqr.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<h3>Invoke</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke.aspx" rel="noreferrer">System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke</a> causes separate thread to wait till invoked method is completed:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XmFJu.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<h3>BeginInvoke</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.control.begininvoke.aspx" rel="noreferrer">System.Windows.Forms.Control.BeginInvoke</a> doesn't cause the separate thread to wait till invoked method is completed:</li>
</ul>

<p>You only want to use <code>Invoke</code> or <code>BeginInvoke</code> for the bare minimum piece of work required to change the UI. Your "heavy" method should execute on another thread (e.g. via <code>BackgroundWorker</code>) but then using <code>Control.Invoke</code>/<code>Control.BeginInvoke</code> just to update the UI. That way your UI thread will be free to handle UI events etc.</p>

<p>See my <a href="http://pobox.com/~skeet/csharp/threads" rel="nofollow noreferrer">threading article</a> for a <a href="http://pobox.com/~skeet/csharp/threads/winforms.shtml" rel="nofollow noreferrer">WinForms example</a> - although the article was written before <code>BackgroundWorker</code> arrived on the scene, and I'm afraid I haven't updated it in that respect. <code>BackgroundWorker</code> merely simplifies the callback a bit.</p>

<p>I know its too late now. However even today if you are having trouble accessing cross thread controls? This is the shortest answer till date :P</p>

<p>I have had this problem with the <code>FileSystemWatcher</code> and found that the following code solved the problem:</p>

<p><code>fsw.SynchronizingObject = this</code></p>

<p>The control then uses the current form object to deal with the events, and will therefore be on the same thread.</p>

<p>I find the check-and-invoke code which needs to be littered within all methods related to forms to be way too verbose and unneeded. Here's a simple extension method which lets you do away with it completely:</p>

<pre class="lang-cs s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Extensions</span>
{
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">Invoke</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-title">TControlType</span>&gt;(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-keyword">this</span> TControlType control, Action&lt;TControlType&gt; del</span>) 
        <span class="hljs-keyword">where</span> TControlType : Control</span>
        {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (control.InvokeRequired)
                control.Invoke(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Action(() =&gt; del(control)));
            <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>
                del(control);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then you can simply do this:</p>

<pre class="lang-cs s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp">textbox1.Invoke(t =&gt; t.Text = <span class="hljs-string">"A"</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>No more messing around - simple.</p>

<p>Controls in .NET are not generally thread safe.  That means you shouldn't access a control from a thread other than the one where it lives.  To get around this, you need to <em>invoke</em> the control, which is what your 2nd sample is attempting.  </p>

<p>However, in your case all you've done is pass the long-running method back to the main thread.  Of course, that's not really what you want to do.  You need to rethink this a little so that all you're doing on the main thread is setting a quick property here and there.</p>

<p>I found a need for this while programming an iOS-Phone monotouch app controller in a visual studio winforms prototype project outside of xamarin stuidio. Preferring to program in VS over xamarin studio as much as possible, I wanted the controller to be completely decoupled from the phone framework. This way implementing this for other frameworks like Android and Windows Phone would be much easier for future uses.</p>

<p>I wanted a solution where the GUI could respond to events without the burden of dealing with the cross threading switching code behind every button click. Basically let the class controller handle that to keep the client code simple. You could possibly have many events on the GUI where as if you could handle it in one place in the class would be cleaner. I am not a multi theading expert, let me know if this is flawed.</p>

<p>Two Ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Return value in e.result and use it to set yout textbox value in backgroundWorker_RunWorkerCompleted event</p></li>
<li><p>Declare some variable to hold these kind of values in a separate class (which will work as data holder) . Create static instance of this class adn you can access it over any thread.</p></li>
</ol>
