<p>but the graph shows the goalkeeper bar first then the defense, and finally the striker one. I would want the graph to be ordered so that the defense bar is closest to the y axis, the goalkeeper one, and finally the striker one.

<p>The key with ordering is to set the levels of the factor in the order you want. An ordered factor is not required; the extra information in an ordered factor isn't necessary and if these data are being used in any statistical model, the wrong parametrisation might result  polynomial contrasts aren't right for nominal data such as this.</p>

<p>In the most general sense, we simply need to set the factor levels to be in the desired order. If left unspecified, the levels of a factor will be sorted alphabetically. You can also specify the level order within the call to factor as above, and other ways are possible as well.</p>

<p>It's similar to what Alex Brown suggested, but a bit shorter and works without an anynymous function definition.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I think my old solution was good at the time, but nowadays I'd rather use <code>forcats::fct_infreq</code> which is sorting factor levels by frequency:</p>

<p>Like <code>reorder()</code> in Alex Brown's answer, we could also use <code>forcats::fct_reorder()</code>. It will basically sort the factors specified in the 1st arg, according to the values in the 2nd arg after applying a specified function (default = median, which is what we use here as just have one value per factor level).</p>

<p>It is a shame that in the OP's question, the order required is also alphabetical as that is the default sort order when you create factors, so will hide what this function is actually doing. To make it more clear, I'll replace "Goalkeeper" with "Zoalkeeper".</p>

<p>I agree with zach that counting within dplyr is the best solution. I've found this to be the shortest version:</p>

<p>This will also be significantly faster than reordering the factor levels beforehand since the count is done in dplyr not in ggplot or using <code>table</code>.</p>

<p>I found it very annoying that <code>ggplot2</code> doesn't offer an 'automatic' solution for this. That's why I created the <code>bar_chart()</code> function in <a href="https://thomas-neitmann.github.io/ggcharts/index.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>ggcharts</code></a>.</p>

<p>By default <code>bar_chart()</code> sorts the bars and displays a horizontal plot. To change that set  <code>horizontal = FALSE</code>. In addition, <code>bar_chart()</code> removes the unsightly 'gap' between the bars and the axis.</p>

<p>Since we are only looking at the distribution of a <em>single variable</em> ("Position") as opposed to looking at the relationship between <em>two variables</em>, then perhaps a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram" rel="nofollow noreferrer">histogram</a> would be the more appropriate graph. ggplot has <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_histogram.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">geom_histogram()</a> that makes it easy:</p>

<p><strong>Using geom_histogram():</strong></p>

<p>I think <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_histogram.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">geom_histogram(</a>) is a little quirky as it treats continuous and discrete data differently. </p>

<p>For <strong>continuous data</strong>, you can just use <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_histogram.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">geom_histogram()</a> with no parameters.
For example, if we add in a numeric vector "Score"...</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">    Name   Position   Score  
<span class="hljs-number">1</span>   James  Goalkeeper <span class="hljs-number">10</span>
<span class="hljs-number">2</span>   Frank  Goalkeeper <span class="hljs-number">20</span>
<span class="hljs-number">3</span>   Jean   Defense    <span class="hljs-number">10</span>
<span class="hljs-number">4</span>   Steve  Defense    <span class="hljs-number">10</span>
<span class="hljs-number">5</span>   John   Defense    <span class="hljs-number">20</span>
<span class="hljs-number">6</span>   Tim    Striker    <span class="hljs-number">50</span>
</code></pre>

<p>and use geom_histogram() on the "Score" variable...</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r">ggplot<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>theTable<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> aes<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>x <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> Score<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span> <span class="hljs-operator">+</span> geom_histogram<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>

<p>For <strong>discrete data</strong> like "Position" we have to specify a calculated statistic computed by the aesthetic to give the y value for the height of the bars using <code>stat = "count"</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r"> ggplot<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>theTable<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> aes<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>x <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> Position<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span> <span class="hljs-operator">+</span> geom_histogram<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>stat <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">"count"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Curiously and confusingly you can also use <code>stat = "count"</code> for continuous data as well and I think it provides a more aesthetically pleasing graph.</p>
