Every now and then I hear the advice &quot;Use bcrypt for storing passwords in PHP, bcrypt rules&quot;.

But what is bcrypt? PHP doesn&#x27;t offer any such functions, Wikipedia babbles about a file-encryption utility and Web searches just reveal a few implementations of Blowfish in different languages. Now Blowfish is also available in PHP via mcrypt, but how does that help with storing passwords? Blowfish is a general purpose cipher, it works two ways. If it could be encrypted, it can be decrypted. Passwords need a one-way hashing function.

What is the explanation?

Passwords need a one-way hashing function.\n\nWhat is the explanation?\n    ","answerCount":11,"upVoteCount":500,"suggestedAnswer":[{"text":"bcrypt is a hashing algorithm which is scalable with hardware (via a configurable number of rounds). Its slowness and multiple rounds ensures that an attacker must deploy massive funds and hardware to be able to crack your passwords. Add to that per-password salts (bcrypt REQUIRES salts) and you can be sure that an attack is virtually unfeasible without either ludicrous amount of funds or hardware.\n\nbcrypt uses the Eksblowfish algorithm to hash passwords. While the encryption phase of Eksblowfish and Blowfish are exactly the same, the key schedule phase of Eksblowfish ensures that any subsequent state depends on both salt and key (user password), and no state can be precomputed without the knowledge of both. Because of this key difference, bcrypt is a one-way hashing algorithm. You cannot retrieve the plain text password without already knowing the salt, rounds and key (password). [Source]\n\nHow to use bcrypt:\n\nUsing PHP &gt;= 5.5-DEV\n\nPassword hashing functions have now been built directly into PHP &gt;= 5.5. You may now use password_hash() to create a bcrypt hash of any password:\n\n&lt;?php\n// Usage 1:\necho password_hash(&apos;rasmuslerdorf&apos;, PASSWORD_DEFAULT).&quot;\\n&quot;;\n// $2y$10$xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n// For example:\n// $2y$10$.vGA1O9wmRjrwAVXD98HNOgsNpDczlqm3Jq7KnEd1rVAGv3Fykk1a\n\n// Usage 2:\n$options = [\n  &apos;cost&apos; =&gt; 11\n];\necho password_hash(&apos;rasmuslerdorf&apos;, PASSWORD_BCRYPT, $options).&quot;\\n&quot;;\n// $2y$11$6DP.V0nO7YI3iSki4qog6OQI5eiO6Jnjsqg7vdnb.JgGIsxniOn4C\n\n\nTo verify a user provided password against an existing hash, you may use the password_verify() as such:\n\n&lt;?php\n// See the password_hash() example to see where this came from.\n$hash = &apos;$2y$07$BCryptRequires22Chrcte/VlQH0piJtjXl.0t1XkA8pw9dMXTpOq&apos;;\n\nif (password_verify(&apos;rasmuslerdorf&apos;, $hash)) {\n    echo &apos;Password is valid!&apos;;\n} else {\n    echo &apos;Invalid password.&apos;;\n}\n\n\nUsing PHP &gt;= 5.3.7, &lt; 5.5-DEV (also RedHat PHP &gt;= 5.3.3)\n\nThere is a compatibility library on GitHub created based on the source code of the above functions originally written in C, which  provides the same functionality. Once the compatibility library is installed, usage is the same as above (minus the shorthand array notation if you are still on the 5.3.x branch).\n\nUsing PHP &lt; 5.3.7 (DEPRECATED)\n\nYou can use crypt() function to generate bcrypt hashes of input strings. This class can automatically generate salts and verify existing hashes against an input. If you are using a version of PHP higher or equal to 5.3.7, it is highly recommended you use the built-in function or the compat library. This alternative is provided only for historical purposes.\n\nclass Bcrypt{\n  private $rounds;\n\n  public function __construct($rounds = 12) {\n    if (CRYPT_BLOWFISH != 1) {\n      throw new Exception(&quot;bcrypt not supported in this installation.

Awesome! However, like other areas of cryptography, you shouldn&apos;t be doing it yourself. If you need to worry about anything like managing keys, or storing salts or generating random numbers, you&apos;re doing it wrong.\n\nThe reason is simple: it&apos;s so trivially easy to screw up bcrypt. In fact, if you look at almost every piece of code on this page, you&apos;ll notice that it&apos;s violating at least one of these common problems.\n\nFace It, Cryptography is hard.\n\nLeave it for the experts. Leave it for people whose job it is to maintain these libraries. If you need to make a decision, you&apos;re doing it wrong.\n\nInstead, just use a library. Several exist depending on your requirements.\n\nLibraries\n\nHere is a breakdown of some of the more common APIs.\n\nPHP 5.5 API - (Available for 5.3.7+)\n\nStarting in PHP 5.5, a new API for hashing passwords is being introduced. There is also a shim compatibility library maintained (by me) for 5.3.7+. This has the benefit of being a peer-reviewed and simple to use implementation.\n\nfunction register($username, $password) {\n    $hash = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);\n    save($username, $hash);\n}\n\nfunction login($username, $password) {\n    $hash = loadHashByUsername($username);\n    if (password_verify($password, $hash)) {\n        //login\n    } else {\n        // failure\n    }\n}\n\n\nReally, it&apos;s aimed to be extremely simple.\n\nResources:\n\n\nDocumentation: on PHP.net\nCompatibility Library: on GitHub\nPHP&apos;s RFC: on wiki.php.net\n\n\nZend\\Crypt\\Password\\Bcrypt (5.3.2+)\n\nThis is another API that&apos;s similar to the PHP 5.5 one, and does a similar purpose. \n\nfunction register($username, $password) {\n    $bcrypt = new Zend\\Crypt\\Password\\Bcrypt();\n    $hash = $bcrypt-&gt;create($password);\n    save($user, $hash);\n}\n\nfunction login($username, $password) {\n    $hash = loadHashByUsername($username);\n    $bcrypt = new Zend\\Crypt\\Password\\Bcrypt();\n    if ($bcrypt-&gt;verify($password, $hash)) {\n        //login\n    } else {\n        // failure\n    }\n}\n\n\nResources:\n\n\nDocumentation: on Zend\nBlog Post: Password Hashing With Zend Crypt\n\n\nPasswordLib\n\nThis is a slightly different approach to password hashing. Rather than simply supporting bcrypt, PasswordLib supports a large number of hashing algorithms. It&apos;s mainly useful in contexts where you need to support compatibility with legacy and disparate systems that may be outside of your control. It supports a large number of hashing algorithms. And is supported 5.3.2+\n\nfunction register($username, $password) {\n    $lib = new PasswordLib\\PasswordLib();\n    $hash = $lib-&gt;createPasswordHash($password, &apos;$2y$&apos;, array(&apos;cost&apos; =&gt; 12));\n    save($user, $hash);\n}\n\nfunction login($username, $password) {\n    $hash = loadHashByUsername($username);\n    $lib = new PasswordLib\\PasswordLib();\n    if ($lib-&gt;verifyPasswordHash($password, $hash)) {\n        //login\n    } else {\n        // failure\n    }\n}\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\nSource Code / Documentation: GitHub\n\n\nPHPASS\n\nThis is a layer that does support bcrypt, but also supports a fairly strong algorithm that&apos;s useful if you do not have access to PHP &gt;= 5.3.2... It actually supports PHP 3.0+ (although not with bcrypt).\n\nfunction register($username, $password) {\n    $phpass = new PasswordHash(12, false);\n    $hash = $phpass-&gt;HashPassword($password);\n    save($user, $hash);\n}\n\nfunction login($username, $password) {\n    $hash = loadHashByUsername($username);\n    $phpass = new PasswordHash(12, false);\n    if ($phpass-&gt;CheckPassword($password, $hash)) {\n        //login\n    } else {\n        // failure\n    }\n}\n\n\nResources\n\n\nCode: cvsweb\nProject Site: on OpenWall\nA review of the &lt; 5.3.0 algorithm: on StackOverflow\n\n\nNote: Don&apos;t use the PHPASS alternatives that are not hosted on openwall, they are different projects!!!\n\nAbout BCrypt\n\nIf you notice, every one of these libraries returns a single string. That&apos;s because of how BCrypt works internally. And there are a TON of answers about that. Here are a selection that I&apos;ve written, that I won&apos;t copy/paste here, but link to:\n\n\nFundamental Difference Between Hashing And Encryption Algorithms - Explaining the terminology and some basic information about them.\nAbout reversing hashes without rainbow tables - Basically why we should use bcrypt in the first place...\nStoring bcrypt Hashes - basically why is the salt and algorithm included in the hash result.\nHow to update the cost of bcrypt hashes - basically how to choose and then maintain the cost of the bcrypt hash.\nHow to hash long passwords with bcrypt - explaining the 72 character password limit of bcrypt.\nHow bcrypt uses salts\nBest practices of salting and peppering passwords - Basically, don&apos;t use a &quot;pepper&quot;\nMigrating old md5 passwords to bcrypt\n\n\nWrap Up\n\nThere are many different choices. Which you choose is up to you. However, I would HIGHLY recommend that you use one of the above libraries for handling this for you. \n\nAgain, if you&apos;re using crypt() directly, you&apos;re probably doing something wrong. If your code is using hash() (or md5() or sha1()) directly, you&apos;re almost definitely doing something wrong.\n\nJust use a library...\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You&apos;ll get a lot of information in Enough With The Rainbow Tables: What You Need To Know About Secure Password Schemes or Portable PHP password hashing framework.\n\nThe goal is to hash the password with something slow, so someone getting your password database will die trying to brute force it (a 10 ms delay to check a password is nothing for you, a lot for someone trying to brute force it).

If more than 5 attempts to login come from the same IP address in any five minute period, block with explanation. A secondary approach is to have a two-tiered password scheme, like banks do. Putting a lock-out for failures on the second pass boosts security.\n\nSummary: slow down the attacker by using time-consuming hash functions. Also, block on too many accesses to your login, and add a second password tier.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution7","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Here&apos;s an updated answer to this old question!\n\nThe right way to hash passwords in PHP since 5.5 is with password_hash(), and the right way to verify them is with password_verify(), and this is still true in PHP 8.0. These functions use bcrypt hashes by default, but other stronger algorithms have been added. You can alter the work factor (effectively how &quot;strong&quot; the encryption is) via the password_hash parameters.\n\nHowever, while it&apos;s still plenty strong enough, bcrypt is no longer considered state-of-the-art; a better set of password hash algorithms has arrived called Argon2, with Argon2i, Argon2d, and Argon2id variants. The difference between them (as described here):\n\n\n  Argon2 has one primary variant: Argon2id, and two supplementary variants: Argon2d and Argon2i. Argon2d uses data-depending memory access, which makes it suitable for cryptocurrencies and proof-of-work applications with no threats from side-channel timing attacks. Argon2i uses data-independent memory access, which is preferred for password hashing and password-based key derivation. Argon2id works as Argon2i for the first half of the first iteration over the memory, and as Argon2d for the rest, thus providing both side-channel attack protection and brute-force cost savings due to time-memory tradeoffs.\n\n\nArgon2i support was added in PHP 7.2, and you request it like this:\n\n$hash = password_hash(&apos;mypassword&apos;, PASSWORD_ARGON2I);\n\n\nand Argon2id support was added in PHP 7.3:\n\n$hash = password_hash(&apos;mypassword&apos;, PASSWORD_ARGON2ID);\n\n\nNo changes are required for verifying passwords since the resulting hash string contains information about what algorithm, salt, and work factors were used when it was created.\n\nQuite separately (and somewhat redundantly), libsodium (added in PHP 7.2) also provides Argon2 hashing via the sodium_crypto_pwhash_str () and sodium_crypto_pwhash_str_verify() functions, which work much the same way as the PHP built-ins. One possible reason for using these is that PHP may sometimes be compiled without libargon2, which makes the Argon2 algorithms unavailable to the password_hash function; PHP 7.2 and higher should always have libsodium enabled, but it may not - but at least there are two ways you can get at that algorithm. Here&apos;s how you can create an Argon2id hash with libsodium (even in PHP 7.2, which otherwise lacks Argon2id support)):\n\n$hash = sodium_crypto_pwhash_str(\n    &apos;mypassword&apos;,\n    SODIUM_CRYPTO_PWHASH_OPSLIMIT_INTERACTIVE,\n    SODIUM_CRYPTO_PWHASH_MEMLIMIT_INTERACTIVE\n);\n\n\nNote that it doesn&apos;t allow you to specify a salt manually; this is part of libsodium&apos;s ethos  don&apos;t allow users to set params to values that might compromise security  for example there is nothing preventing you from passing an empty salt string to PHP&apos;s password_hash function; libsodium doesn&apos;t let you do anything so silly!\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution8","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"For OAuth 2 passwords:\n\n$bcrypt = new \\Zend\\Crypt\\Password\\Bcrypt;\n$bcrypt-&gt;create(&quot;youpasswordhere&quot;, 10)\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution9","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"As we all know storing password in clear text in database is not secure.\nthe bcrypt is a hashing password technique.It is used to built password security.

<p>Every now and then I hear the advice "Use bcrypt for storing passwords in PHP, bcrypt rules".</p>

<p>But what is <code>bcrypt</code>? PHP doesn't offer any such functions, Wikipedia babbles about a file-encryption utility and Web searches just reveal a few implementations of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowfish_%28cipher%29" rel="noreferrer">Blowfish</a> in different languages. Now Blowfish is also available in PHP via <code>mcrypt</code>, but how does that help with storing passwords? Blowfish is a general purpose cipher, it works two ways. If it could be encrypted, it can be decrypted. Passwords need a one-way hashing function.</p>

<p>What is the explanation?</p>

<p><code>bcrypt</code> is a hashing algorithm which is scalable with hardware (via a configurable number of rounds). Its slowness and multiple rounds ensures that an attacker must deploy massive funds and hardware to be able to crack your passwords. Add to that per-password <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_%28cryptography%29" rel="noreferrer">salts</a> (<code>bcrypt</code> REQUIRES salts) and you can be sure that an attack is virtually unfeasible without either ludicrous amount of funds or hardware.</p>

<p><code>bcrypt</code> uses the <em>Eksblowfish</em> algorithm to hash passwords. While the encryption phase of <em>Eksblowfish</em> and <em>Blowfish</em> are exactly the same, the key schedule phase of <em>Eksblowfish</em> ensures that any subsequent state depends on both salt and key (user password), and no state can be precomputed without the knowledge of both. <strong>Because of this key difference, <code>bcrypt</code> is a one-way hashing algorithm.</strong> You cannot retrieve the plain text password without already knowing the salt, rounds <strong>and key</strong> (password).

<h2>Using PHP &gt;= 5.3.7, &lt; 5.5-DEV (also RedHat PHP &gt;= 5.3.3)</h2>

<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/ircmaxell/password_compat" rel="noreferrer">compatibility library</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a> created based on the source code of the above functions originally written in C, which  provides the same functionality.

<h2>Using PHP &lt; 5.3.7 <em>(DEPRECATED)</em></h2>

<p>You can use <code>crypt()</code> function to generate bcrypt hashes of input strings. This class can automatically generate salts and verify existing hashes against an input. <strong>If you are using a version of PHP higher or equal to 5.3.7, it is highly recommended you use the built-in function or the compat library</strong>.

<p>So, you want to use bcrypt? <strong>Awesome!</strong> However, like other areas of cryptography, you shouldn't be doing it yourself. If you need to worry about anything like managing keys, or storing salts or generating random numbers, you're doing it wrong.</p>

<p>The reason is simple: it's so trivially easy to <a href="http://blog.ircmaxell.com/2012/12/seven-ways-to-screw-up-bcrypt.html" rel="noreferrer">screw up bcrypt</a>. In fact, if you look at almost every piece of code on this page, you'll notice that it's violating at least one of these common problems.</p>

<h1>Face It, Cryptography is hard.</h1>

<p>Leave it for the experts. Leave it for people whose job it is to maintain these libraries. If you need to make a decision, you're doing it wrong.</p>

<p>Instead, just use a library. Several exist depending on your requirements.</p>

<h1>Libraries</h1>

<p>Here is a breakdown of some of the more common APIs.</p>

<h2>PHP 5.5 API - (Available for 5.3.7+)</h2>

<p>Starting in PHP 5.5, a new API for hashing passwords is being introduced. There is also a shim compatibility library maintained (by me) for 5.3.7+. This has the benefit of being a peer-reviewed and <em>simple</em> to use implementation.</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">register</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-variable">$username</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$password</span></span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-variable">$hash</span> = <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">password_hash</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$password</span>, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">save</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$username</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$hash</span>);
}

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">login</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-variable">$username</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$password</span></span>) </span>{
    <span class="hljs-variable">$hash</span> = <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">loadHashByUsername</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$username</span>);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">password_verify</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$password</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$hash</span>)) {
        <span class="hljs-comment">//login</span>
    } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
        <span class="hljs-comment">// failure</span>
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Really, it's aimed to be extremely simple.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Zend\Crypt\Password\Bcrypt (5.3.2+)</h2>

<p>This is another API that's similar to the PHP 5.5 one, and does a similar purpose. </p>

<h2>PasswordLib</h2>

<p>This is a slightly different approach to password hashing. Rather than simply supporting bcrypt, PasswordLib supports a large number of hashing algorithms. It's mainly useful in contexts where you need to support compatibility with legacy and disparate systems that may be outside of your control. It supports a large number of hashing algorithms. And is supported 5.3.2+</p>

<h2>PHPASS</h2>

<p>This is a layer that does support bcrypt, but also supports a fairly strong algorithm that's useful if you do not have access to PHP &gt;= 5.3.2... It actually supports PHP 3.0+ (although not with bcrypt).</p>

</ul>

<h1>Wrap Up</h1>

<p>There are many different choices. Which you choose is up to you. However, I would <strong>HIGHLY</strong> recommend that you use one of the above libraries for handling this for you. </p>

<p>Again, if you're using <code>crypt()</code> directly, you're probably doing something wrong. If your code is using <code>hash()</code> (or <code>md5()</code> or <code>sha1()</code>) directly, you're almost definitely doing something wrong.</p>

<p>Just use a library...</p>

<p>Version 5.5 of PHP will have built-in support for BCrypt, the functions <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php" rel="noreferrer"><code>password_hash()</code></a> and <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.password-verify.php" rel="noreferrer"><code>password_verify()</code></a>. Actually these are just wrappers around the function <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.crypt.php" rel="noreferrer"><code>crypt()</code></a>, and shall make it easier to use it correctly. It takes care of the generation of a safe random salt, and provides good default values.</p>

<p>The easiest way to use this functions will be:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$hashToStoreInDb</span> = <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">password_hash</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$password</span>, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);
<span class="hljs-variable">$isPasswordCorrect</span> = <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">password_verify</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$password</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$existingHashFromDb</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>This code will hash the password with BCrypt (algorithm <code>2y</code>), generates a random salt from the OS random source, and uses the default cost parameter (at the moment this is 10). The second line checks, if the user entered password matches an already stored hash-value.</p>

<p>Should you want to change the cost parameter, you can do it like this, increasing the cost parameter by 1, doubles the needed time to calculate the hash value:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$hash</span> = <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">password_hash</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$password</span>, PASSWORD_BCRYPT, <span class="hljs-keyword">array</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"cost"</span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-number">11</span>));
</code></pre>

<p>In contrast to the <code>"cost"</code> parameter, it is best to omit the <code>"salt"</code> parameter, because the function already does its best to create a cryptographically safe salt.</p>

<p>For PHP version 5.3.7 and later, there exists a <a href="https://github.com/ircmaxell/password_compat/blob/master/lib/password.php" rel="noreferrer">compatibility pack</a>, from the same author that made the <code>password_hash()</code> function. For PHP versions before 5.3.7 there is no support for <code>crypt()</code> with <code>2y</code>, the unicode safe BCrypt algorithm. One could replace it instead with <code>2a</code>, which is the best alternative for earlier PHP versions.</p>

<p>Current thinking: hashes should be the slowest available, not the fastest possible. This suppresses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table" rel="noreferrer">rainbow table</a> attacks.</p>

<p>Also related, but precautionary: An attacker should never have unlimited access to your login screen. To prevent that: Set up an IP address tracking table that records every hit along with the URI. If more than 5 attempts to login come from the same IP address in any five minute period, block with explanation. A secondary approach is to have a two-tiered password scheme, like banks do. Putting a lock-out for failures on the second pass boosts security.</p>

<p>Summary: slow down the attacker by using time-consuming hash functions. Also, block on too many accesses to your login, and add a second password tier.</p>

<p>Here's an updated answer to this old question!</p>

<p>The right way to hash passwords in PHP since 5.5 is with <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.password-hash.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>password_hash()</code></a>, and the right way to verify them is with <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.password-verify.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>password_verify()</code></a>, and this is still true in PHP 8.0. These functions use bcrypt hashes by default, but other stronger algorithms have been added. You can alter the work factor (effectively how "strong" the encryption is) via the <code>password_hash</code> parameters.</p>

<p>However, while it's still plenty strong enough, <strong>bcrypt is no longer considered state-of-the-art</strong>; a better set of password hash algorithms has arrived called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Argon2</a>, with Argon2i, Argon2d, and Argon2id variants. The difference between them (as described <a href="https://www.cryptolux.org/index.php/Argon2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Argon2 has one primary variant: Argon2id, and two supplementary variants: Argon2d and Argon2i. Argon2d uses data-depending memory access, which makes it suitable for cryptocurrencies and proof-of-work applications with no threats from side-channel timing attacks. Argon2i uses data-independent memory access, which is preferred for password hashing and password-based key derivation. Argon2id works as Argon2i for the first half of the first iteration over the memory, and as Argon2d for the rest, thus providing both side-channel attack protection and brute-force cost savings due to time-memory tradeoffs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Argon2i support was added in PHP 7.2, and you request it like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$hash</span> = <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">password_hash</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'mypassword'</span>, PASSWORD_ARGON2I);
</code></pre>

<p>and Argon2id support was added in PHP 7.3:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$hash</span> = <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">password_hash</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'mypassword'</span>, PASSWORD_ARGON2ID);
</code></pre>

<p>No changes are required for verifying passwords since the resulting hash string contains information about what algorithm, salt, and work factors were used when it was created.</p>

<p>Quite separately (and somewhat redundantly), libsodium (added in PHP 7.2) also provides Argon2 hashing via the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.sodium-crypto-pwhash-str.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sodium_crypto_pwhash_str ()</code></a> and <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.sodium-crypto-pwhash-str-verify.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sodium_crypto_pwhash_str_verify()</code></a> functions, which work much the same way as the PHP built-ins. One possible reason for using these is that PHP may sometimes be compiled without libargon2, which makes the Argon2 algorithms unavailable to the password_hash function; PHP 7.2 and higher should always have libsodium enabled, but it may not - but at least there are two ways you can get at that algorithm. Here's how you can create an Argon2id hash with libsodium (even in PHP 7.2, which otherwise lacks Argon2id support)):</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$hash</span> = <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">sodium_crypto_pwhash_str</span>(
    <span class="hljs-string">'mypassword'</span>,
    SODIUM_CRYPTO_PWHASH_OPSLIMIT_INTERACTIVE,
    SODIUM_CRYPTO_PWHASH_MEMLIMIT_INTERACTIVE
);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that it doesn't allow you to specify a salt manually; this is part of libsodium's ethos  <em>don't allow users to set params to values that might compromise security</em>  for example there is nothing preventing you from passing an empty salt string to PHP's <code>password_hash</code> function; libsodium doesn't let you do anything so silly!</p>

<p>As we all know storing password in clear text in database is not secure.
the bcrypt is a hashing password technique.It is used to built password security. One of the amazing function of bcrypt is it save us from hackers it is used to protect the password from hacking attacks because the password is stored in bcrypted form.</p>
<p>The <code>password_hash()</code> function is used to create a new password hash. It uses a strong &amp; robust hashing algorithm. The <code>password_hash()</code> function is very much compatible with the <code>crypt()</code> function. Therefore, password hashes created by <code>crypt()</code> may be used with <code>password_hash()</code> and vice-versa. The functions <code>password_verify()</code> and <code>password_hash()</code> just the wrappers around the function <code>crypt()</code>, and they make it much easier to use it accurately.</p>

<p>To use the <code>BCRYPT</code>, set option <code>cost=12</code> in an <code>$options</code>, also change  first parameter <code>$password</code> to some strong password like <code>"wgt167yuWBGY@#1987__"</code>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-keyword">echo</span> <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">password_hash</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"wgt167yuWBGY@#1987__"</span>, PASSWORD_BCRYPT, [<span class="hljs-string">'cost'</span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-number">12</span>]);
