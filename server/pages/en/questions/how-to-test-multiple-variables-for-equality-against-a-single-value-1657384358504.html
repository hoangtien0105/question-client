You are looking for:\nif x == 1 or y == 1 or z == 1:\n\nx and y are otherwise evaluated on their own (False if 0, True otherwise).\nYou can shorten that using a containment test against a tuple:\nif 1 in (x, y, z):\n\nor better still:\nif 1 in {x, y, z}:\n\nusing a set to take advantage of the constant-cost membership test (i.e. in takes a fixed amount of time whatever the left-hand operand is).\nExplanation\nWhen you use or, python sees each side of the operator as separate expressions. The expression x or y == 1 is treated as first a boolean test for x, then if that is False, the expression y == 1 is tested.\nThis is due to operator precedence. The or operator has a lower precedence than the == test, so the latter is evaluated first.\nHowever, even if this were not the case, and the expression x or y or z == 1 was actually interpreted as (x or y or z) == 1 instead, this would still not do what you expect it to do.\nx or y or z would evaluate to the first argument that is &apos;truthy&apos;, e.g. not False, numeric 0 or empty (see boolean expressions for details on what Python considers false in a boolean context).\nSo for the values x = 2; y = 1; z = 0, x or y or z would resolve to 2, because that is the first true-like value in the arguments. Then 2 == 1 would be False, even though y == 1 would be True.\nThe same would apply to the inverse; testing multiple values against a single variable; x == 1 or 2 or 3 would fail for the same reasons. Use x == 1 or x == 2 or x == 3 or x in {1, 2, 3}.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Your problem is more easily addressed with a dictionary structure like:\n\nx = 0\ny = 1\nz = 3\nd = {0: &apos;c&apos;, 1:&apos;d&apos;, 2:&apos;e&apos;, 3:&apos;f&apos;}\nmylist = [d[k] for k in [x, y, z]]\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"As stated by Martijn Pieters, the correct, and fastest, format is:\n\nif 1 in {x, y, z}:\n\n\nUsing his advice you would now have separate if-statements so that Python will read each statement whether the former were True or False.

The way your original statement was written, those parts were:\nx\ny\nz == 0   // or 1, 2, 3 depending on the if statement\n\nThe last part was fine --- checking to see if z == 0, for instance --- but the first two parts just said essentially if x and if y. Since integers always evaluate to True unless they&apos;re 0, that means the first part of your condition was always True when x or y didn&apos;t equal 0 (which in the case of y was always, since you had y = 1, causing your whole condition (because of how OR works) to always be True.\nTo avoid that, you need to make sure all parts of your condition (each side of the OR) make sense on their own (you can do that by pretending that the other side(s) of the OR statement doesn&apos;t exist). That&apos;s how you can confirm whether or not your OR condition is correctly defined.\nYou would write the statements individually like so:\nif x == 0\nif y == 0\nif z == 0\n\nwhich means the correct mergin with the OR keyword would be:\nif x == 0 or y == 0 or z == 0\n\nSECOND, HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM:\nYou&apos;re basically wanting to check to see if any of the variables match a given integer and if so, assign it a letter that matches it in a one-to-one mapping. You want to do that for a certain list of integers so that the output is a list of letters. You&apos;d do that like this:\ndef func(x, y, z):\n\n    result = []\n\n    for integer, letter in zip([0, 1, 2, 3], [&apos;c&apos;, &apos;d&apos;, &apos;e&apos;, &apos;f&apos;]):\n        if x == integer or y == integer or z == integer:\n            result.append(letter)\n            \n    return result\n        \n\nSimilarly, you could use LIST COMPREHENSION to achieve the same result faster:\ndef func(x, y, z):\n\n    return [ \n                letter \n                for integer, letter in zip([0, 1, 2, 3], [&apos;c&apos;, &apos;d&apos;, &apos;e&apos;, &apos;f&apos;])\n

<p>I'm trying to make a function that will compare multiple variables to an integer and output a string of three letters. I was wondering if there was a way to translate this into Python. So say:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">x = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
y = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
z = <span class="hljs-number">3</span>
mylist = []

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> x <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> y <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> z == <span class="hljs-number">0</span>:
    mylist.append(<span class="hljs-string">"c"</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> x <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> y <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> z == <span class="hljs-number">1</span>:
    mylist.append(<span class="hljs-string">"d"</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> x <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> y <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> z == <span class="hljs-number">2</span>:
    mylist.append(<span class="hljs-string">"e"</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> x <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> y <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> z == <span class="hljs-number">3</span>: 
    mylist.append(<span class="hljs-string">"f"</span>)

<p>You misunderstand how boolean expressions work; they don't work like an English sentence and guess that you are talking about the same comparison for all names here. You are looking for:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> x == <span class="hljs-number">1</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> y == <span class="hljs-number">1</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> z == <span class="hljs-number">1</span>:
</code></pre>
<p><code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are otherwise evaluated on their own (<code>False</code> if <code>0</code>, <code>True</code> otherwise).</p>
<p>You can shorten that using a containment test against <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences" rel="noreferrer">a tuple</a>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> (x, y, z):
</code></pre>
<p>or better still:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> {x, y, z}:
</code></pre>
<p>using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets" rel="noreferrer">a <code>set</code></a> to take advantage of the constant-cost membership test (i.e. <code>in</code> takes a fixed amount of time whatever the left-hand operand is).</p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>When you use <code>or</code>, python sees each side of the operator as <em>separate</em> expressions. The expression <code>x or y == 1</code> is treated as first a boolean test for <code>x</code>, then if that is False, the expression <code>y == 1</code> is tested.</p>
<p>This is due to <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence" rel="noreferrer">operator precedence</a>. The <code>or</code> operator has a lower precedence than the <code>==</code> test, so the latter is evaluated <em>first</em>.</p>
<p>However, even if this were <em>not</em> the case, and the expression <code>x or y or z == 1</code> was actually interpreted as <code>(x or y or z) == 1</code> instead, this would still not do what you expect it to do.</p>
<p><code>x or y or z</code> would evaluate to the first argument that is 'truthy', e.g. not <code>False</code>, numeric 0 or empty (see <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#boolean-operations" rel="noreferrer">boolean expressions</a> for details on what Python considers false in a boolean context).</p>
<p>So for the values <code>x = 2; y = 1; z = 0</code>, <code>x or y or z</code> would resolve to <code>2</code>, because that is the first true-like value in the arguments. Then <code>2 == 1</code> would be <code>False</code>, even though <code>y == 1</code> would be <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>The same would apply to the inverse; testing multiple values against a single variable; <code>x == 1 or 2 or 3</code> would fail for the same reasons. Use <code>x == 1 or x == 2 or x == 3</code> or <code>x in {1, 2, 3}</code>.</p>

<p>As stated by Martijn Pieters, the correct, and fastest, format is:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> {x, y, z}:
</code></pre>

<p>Using his advice you would now have separate if-statements so that Python will read each statement whether the former were <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. Such as:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> {x, y, z}:
    mylist.append(<span class="hljs-string">"c"</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> {x, y, z}:
    mylist.append(<span class="hljs-string">"d"</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> {x, y, z}:
    mylist.append(<span class="hljs-string">"e"</span>)
...
</code></pre>

<p>This will work, but <em>if</em> you are comfortable using dictionaries (see what I did there), you can clean this up by making an initial dictionary mapping the numbers to the letters you want, then just using a for-loop:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">num_to_letters = {<span class="hljs-number">0</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"c"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"d"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"e"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"f"</span>}

    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> number <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> {x, y, z}:
        mylist.append(num_to_letters[number])

<p>The direct way to write <code>x or y or z == 0</code> is</p>

<p>If you ARE very very lazy, you can put the values inside an array. Such as</p>

        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> obj == num[index]:
            MyList.append(letters[index])
            <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>
</code></pre>

<p>You can also put the numbers and letters in a dictionary and do it, but this is probably a LOT more complicated than simply if statements. That's what you get for trying to be extra lazy :)</p>

<p>One more thing, your </p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> x <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> y <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> z == <span class="hljs-number">0</span>:

<p>will compile, but not in the way you want it to. When you simply put a variable in an if statement (example)</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> b
</code></pre>

<p>the program will check if the variable is not null. Another way to write the above statement (which makes more sense) is </p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">bool</span>(b)
</code></pre>

<p>Bool is an inbuilt function in python which basically does the command of verifying a boolean statement (If you don't know what that is, it is what you are trying to make in your if statement right now :))</p>

<p>Another lazy way I found is :</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">any</span>([x==<span class="hljs-number">0</span>, y==<span class="hljs-number">0</span>, z==<span class="hljs-number">0</span>])

<p>To check if a value is contained within a set of variables you can use the inbuilt modules           <code>itertools</code> and <code>operator</code>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Imports:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> itertools <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> repeat
<span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> operator <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> contains
</code></pre>

<p>Declare variables:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">x = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
y = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
z = <span class="hljs-number">3</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Create mapping of values (in the order you want to check):</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">check_values = (<span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>Use <code>itertools</code> to allow repetition of the variables:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">check_vars = repeat((x, y, z))
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, use the <code>map</code> function to create an iterator:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">checker = <span class="hljs-built_in">map</span>(contains, check_vars, check_values)
</code></pre>

<p>Then, when checking for the values (in the original order), use <code>next()</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">next</span>(checker)  <span class="hljs-comment"># Checks for 0</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment"># Do something</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">pass</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">elif</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">next</span>(checker)  <span class="hljs-comment"># Checks for 1</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment"># Do something</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">pass</span>
</code></pre>

<p>etc...</p>

<p>This has an advantage over the <code>lambda x: x in (variables)</code> because <code>operator</code> is an inbuilt module and is faster and more efficient than using <code>lambda</code> which has to create a custom in-place function.</p>

<p>Another option for checking if there is a non-zero (or False) value in a list:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> (x <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> y <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> z)
</code></pre>

<p>Equivalent:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">all</span>((x, y, z))

<p>All of the excellent answers provided here concentrate on the specific requirement of the original poster and concentrate on the <code>if 1 in {x,y,z}</code> solution put forward by Martijn Pieters.<br>
What they ignore is the broader implication of the question:<br>
<strong>How do I test one variable against multiple values?</strong><br>
The solution provided will not work for partial hits if using strings for example:<br>
Test if the string "Wild" is in multiple values</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>x = <span class="hljs-string">"Wild things"</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>y = <span class="hljs-string">"throttle it back"</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>z = <span class="hljs-string">"in the beginning"</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Wild"</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> {x, y, z}: <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> (<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>)

<p>or</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>x = <span class="hljs-string">"Wild things"</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>y = <span class="hljs-string">"throttle it back"</span>

<p>for this scenario it's easiest to convert to a string</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>[x, y, z]

<span class="hljs-meta">... </span>
<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>

<p>It should be noted however, as mentioned by <code>@codeforester</code>, that word boundries are lost with this method, as in:    </p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>x=[<span class="hljs-string">'Wild things'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'throttle it back'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'in the beginning'</span>]

<span class="hljs-meta">... </span>
<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>
</code></pre>

<p>the 3 letters <code>rot</code> do exist in combination in the list but not as an individual word. Testing for " rot " would fail but if one of the list items were "rot in hell", that would fail as well.<br>
The upshot being, be careful with your search criteria if using this method and be aware that it does have this limitation.</p>

<p>Looks like you're building some kind of Caesar cipher.</p>

<p>A much more generalized approach is this:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">input_values = (<span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>)
origo = <span class="hljs-built_in">ord</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>)

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">[<span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'d'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'f'</span>]

<p>Not sure if it's a desired side effect of your code, but the order of your output will always be sorted.</p>

<p>If this is what you want, the final line can be changed to:</p>

<p>The <code>or</code> does not work like that, as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/20002504/918959">explained by this answer</a>.</p>
<p>While the generic answer would be use</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> (x, y, z):

</code></pre>
<p>this is not the best one for the <em>specific</em> problem. In your case you're doing <em>repeated tests</em>, therefore it is worthwhile to compose a <em>set</em> of these variables:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">values = {x, y, z}

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> values:
    mylist.append(<span class="hljs-string">"c"</span>)

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> values:
    mylist.append(<span class="hljs-string">"d"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>We can simplify this using a dictionary - this will result in the same values:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">mappings = {<span class="hljs-number">0</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"c"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"d"</span>, ...}
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> k <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> mappings:
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> k <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> values:
        mylist.append(mappings[k])
</code></pre>
<p>Or if the ordering of the <code>mylist</code> is arbitrary, you can loop over the <em>values</em> instead and match them to the mappings:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">mappings = {<span class="hljs-number">0</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"c"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"d"</span>, ...}

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-built_in">any</span>([<span class="hljs-number">0</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> <span class="hljs-literal">True</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> <span class="hljs-literal">False</span>])
<span class="hljs-literal">False</span>
</code></pre>

<p>which can be written as</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-built_in">any</span>(<span class="hljs-number">0</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> item <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> item <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> (<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">False</span>))
<span class="hljs-literal">False</span>
</code></pre>

<p>While this expression returns the right result it is not as readable as the first expression :-(</p>

<p>FIRST, A CORRECTION TO THE <code>OR</code> CONDITIONAL:</p>
<p>You need to say:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> x == <span class="hljs-number">0</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> y == <span class="hljs-number">0</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> z == <span class="hljs-number">0</span>:
</code></pre>
<p>The reason is that "or" splits up the condition into separate logical parts. The way your original statement was written, those parts were:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">x
y
z == <span class="hljs-number">0</span>   // <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span> depending on the <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> statement
</code></pre>
<p>The last part was fine --- checking to see if z == 0, for instance --- but the first two parts just said essentially <code>if x</code> and <code>if y</code>. Since integers always evaluate to <code>True</code> unless they're 0, that means the first part of your condition was always <code>True</code> when <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> didn't equal 0 (which in the case of y was always, since you had <code>y = 1</code>, causing your whole condition (because of how <code>OR</code> works) to always be <code>True</code>.</p>
<p>To avoid that, you need to make sure all parts of your condition (each side of the <code>OR</code>) make sense on their own (you can do that by pretending that the other side(s) of the <code>OR</code> statement doesn't exist). That's how you can confirm whether or not your <code>OR</code> condition is correctly defined.</p>
<p>You would write the statements individually like so:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> x == <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> y == <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> z == <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
</code></pre>
<p>which means the correct mergin with the <code>OR</code> keyword would be:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> x == <span class="hljs-number">0</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> y == <span class="hljs-number">0</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> z == <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
</code></pre>
<p>SECOND, HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM:</p>
<p>You're basically wanting to check to see if any of the variables match a given integer and if so, assign it a letter that matches it in a one-to-one mapping. You want to do that for a certain list of integers so that the output is a list of letters. You'd do that like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">func</span>(<span class="hljs-params">x, y, z</span>):

    result = []

    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> integer, letter <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">zip</span>([<span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>], [<span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'d'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'e'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'f'</span>]):
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> x == integer <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> y == integer <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> z == integer:
            result.append(letter)
            
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> result
        
</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, you could use LIST COMPREHENSION to achieve the same result faster:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">func</span>(<span class="hljs-params">x, y, z</span>):

    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> [ 
                letter 
                <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> integer, letter <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">zip</span>([<span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>], [<span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'d'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'e'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'f'</span>])
                <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> x == integer <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> y == integer <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> z == integer
           ]
