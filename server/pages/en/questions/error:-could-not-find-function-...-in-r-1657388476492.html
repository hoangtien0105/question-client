I am using R and tried some.function but I got following error message:
Error: could not find function &quot;some.function&quot;

When a grid is not homogenous, not all libraries may be installed, and my experience has often been that a package wasn&apos;t installed because a dependency wasn&apos;t installed.  To address this, I check the following:\n\n\nIs Fortran installed? (Look for &apos;gfortran&apos;.) This affects several major packages in R.\nIs Java installed?  Are the Java class paths correct?\nCheck that the package was installed by the admin and available for use by the appropriate user.  Sometimes users will install packages in the wrong places or run without appropriate access to the right libraries.  .libPaths() is a good check.\nCheck ldd results for R, to be sure about shared libraries\nIt&apos;s good to periodically run a script that just loads every package needed and does some little test.  This catches the package issue as early as possible in the workflow.  This is akin to build testing or unit testing, except it&apos;s more like a smoke test to make sure that the very basic stuff works.\nIf packages can be stored in a network-accessible location, are they?  If they cannot, is there a way to ensure consistent versions across the machines?  (This may seem OT, but correct package installation includes availability of the right version.)\nIs the package available for the given OS?  Unfortunately, not all packages are available across platforms.  This goes back to step 5.  If possible, try to find a way to handle a different OS by switching to an appropriate flavor of a package or switch off the dependency in certain cases.\n\n\nHaving encountered this quite a bit, some of these steps become fairly routine.

To call such function if you know what you are doing requires the use of <code>:::</code>. You also need to know the namespace in which the function is found. Using <code>getAnywhere()</code> we find that the function is in package <strong>stats</strong>:</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r"><span class="hljs-operator">&gt;</span> getAnywhere<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>plot.prcomp<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
A single object matching plot.prcomp was found
It was found <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> the following places
  registered S3 method <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> plot from namespace stats
  namespace<span class="hljs-operator">:</span>stats
with value

<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>x<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> main <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> deparse<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span><span class="hljs-built_in">substitute</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>x<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> ...<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span> 
screeplot.default<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>x<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> main <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> main<span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span> ...<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
<span class="hljs-operator">&lt;</span>environment<span class="hljs-operator">:</span> namespace<span class="hljs-operator">:</span>stats<span class="hljs-operator">&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>So we can now call it directly using:</p>

<pre class="lang-r s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-r"><span class="hljs-operator">&gt;</span> stats<span class="hljs-operator">:::</span>plot.prcomp<span class="hljs-punctuation">(</span>mod<span class="hljs-punctuation">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>I've used <code>plot.prcomp</code> just as an example to illustrate the purpose. In normal use you shouldn't be calling S3 methods like this. But as I said, if the function you want to call exists (it might be a hidden utility function for example), but is in a <code>namespace</code>, R will report that it can't find the function unless you tell it which namespace to look in.</p>

<p>Compare this to the following:
<code>stats::plot.prcomp</code>
The above fails because while <code>stats</code> uses <code>plot.prcomp</code>, it is not exported from <code>stats</code> as the error rightly tells us:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error: 'plot.prcomp' is not an exported object from 'namespace:stats'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is documented as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>pkg::name returns the value of the exported variable name in namespace pkg, whereas pkg:::name returns the value of the internal variable name.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can usually resolve this problem when a computer is under my control, but it's more of a nuisance when working with a grid.  When a grid is not homogenous, not all libraries may be installed, and my experience has often been that a package wasn't installed because a dependency wasn't installed.  To address this, I check the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is Fortran installed? (Look for 'gfortran'.) This affects several major packages in R.</li>
<li>Is Java installed?  Are the Java class paths correct?</li>
<li>Check that the package was installed by the admin and available for use by the appropriate user.  Sometimes users will install packages in the wrong places or run without appropriate access to the right libraries.  <code>.libPaths()</code> is a good check.</li>
<li>Check <code>ldd</code> results for R, to be sure about shared libraries</li>
<li>It's good to periodically run a script that just loads every package needed and does some little test.  This catches the package issue as early as possible in the workflow.  This is akin to build testing or unit testing, except it's more like a smoke test to make sure that the very basic stuff works.</li>
<li>If packages can be stored in a network-accessible location, are they?  If they cannot, is there a way to ensure consistent versions across the machines?  (This may seem OT, but correct package installation includes availability of the <em>right</em> version.)</li>
<li>Is the package available for the given OS?  Unfortunately, not all packages are available across platforms.  This goes back to step 5.  If possible, try to find a way to handle a different OS by switching to an appropriate flavor of a package or switch off the dependency in certain cases.</li>
</ol>

<p>Having encountered this quite a bit, some of these steps become fairly routine.  Although #7 might seem like a good starting point, these are listed in approximate order of the frequency that I use them.</p>

<p>happen when doing R CMD check of a package I was making with RStudio.  I found adding</p>

<p>exportPattern(".")</p>

<p>to the NAMESPACE file did the trick.  As a sidenote, I had initially configured RStudio to use ROxygen to make the documentation -- and selected the configuration where ROxygen would write my NAMESPACE file for me, which kept erasing my edits.

When a grid is not homogenous, not all libraries may be installed, and my experience has often been that a package wasn\u0026apos;t installed because a dependency wasn\u0026apos;t installed.  To address this, I check the following:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ol\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Is Fortran installed? (Look for \u0026apos;gfortran\u0026apos;.) This affects several major packages in R.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Is Java installed?  Are the Java class paths correct?\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Check that the package was installed by the admin and available for use by the appropriate user.  Sometimes users will install packages in the wrong places or run without appropriate access to the right libraries.  \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;.libPaths()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is a good check.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Check \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ldd\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; results for R, to be sure about shared libraries\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;It\u0026apos;s good to periodically run a script that just loads every package needed and does some little test.  This catches the package issue as early as possible in the workflow.  This is akin to build testing or unit testing, except it\u0026apos;s more like a smoke test to make sure that the very basic stuff works.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;If packages can be stored in a network-accessible location, are they?  If they cannot, is there a way to ensure consistent versions across the machines?  (This may seem OT, but correct package installation includes availability of the \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;right\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; version.)\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Is the package available for the given OS?  Unfortunately, not all packages are available across platforms.  This goes back to step 5.  If possible, try to find a way to handle a different OS by switching to an appropriate flavor of a package or switch off the dependency in certain cases.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ol\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Having encountered this quite a bit, some of these steps become fairly routine.
