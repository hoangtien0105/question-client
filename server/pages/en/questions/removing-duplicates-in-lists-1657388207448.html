Sets are unordered collections of distinct objects. To create a set from any iterable, you can simply pass it to the built-in set() function. If you later need a real list again, you can similarly pass the set to the list() function.\nThe following example should cover whatever you are trying to do:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; list(set(t))\n[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; s = [1, 2, 3]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; list(set(t) - set(s))\n[8, 5, 6, 7]\n\nAs you can see from the example result, the original order is not maintained. As mentioned above, sets themselves are unordered collections, so the order is lost. When converting a set back to a list, an arbitrary order is created.\nMaintaining order\nIf order is important to you, then you will have to use a different mechanism. A very common solution for this is to rely on OrderedDict to keep the order of keys during insertion:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import OrderedDict\n&gt;&gt;&gt; list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(t))\n[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\nStarting with Python 3.7, the built-in dictionary is guaranteed to maintain the insertion order as well, so you can also use that directly if you are on Python 3.7 or later (or CPython 3.6):\n&gt;&gt;&gt; list(dict.fromkeys(t))\n[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n\nNote that this may have some overhead of creating a dictionary first, and then creating a list from it. If you dont actually need to preserve the order, youre often better off using a set, especially because it gives you a lot more operations to work with. Check out this question for more details and alternative ways to preserve the order when removing duplicates.\n\nFinally note that both the set as well as the OrderedDict/dict solutions require your items to be hashable. This usually means that they have to be immutable. If you have to deal with items that are not hashable (e.g. list objects), then you will have to use a slow approach in which you will basically have to compare every item with every other item in a nested loop.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"In Python 2.7, the new way of removing duplicates from an iterable while keeping it in the original order is:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from collections import OrderedDict\n&gt;&gt;&gt; list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(&apos;abracadabra&apos;))\n[&apos;a&apos;, &apos;b&apos;, &apos;r&apos;, &apos;c&apos;, &apos;d&apos;]\n\n\nIn Python 3.5, the OrderedDict has a C implementation. My timings show that this is now both the fastest and shortest of the various approaches for Python 3.5.\n\nIn Python 3.6, the regular dict became both ordered and compact.  (This feature is holds for CPython and PyPy but may not present in other implementations).  That gives us a new fastest way of deduping while retaining order:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; list(dict.fromkeys(&apos;abracadabra&apos;))\n[&apos;a&apos;, &apos;b&apos;, &apos;r&apos;, &apos;c&apos;, &apos;d&apos;]\n\n\nIn Python 3.7, the regular dict is guaranteed to both ordered across all implementations.  So, the shortest and fastest solution is:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; list(dict.fromkeys(&apos;abracadabra&apos;))\n[&apos;a&apos;, &apos;b&apos;, &apos;r&apos;, &apos;c&apos;, &apos;d&apos;]\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"It&apos;s a one-liner: list(set(source_list)) will do the trick.\n\nA set is something that can&apos;t possibly have duplicates.\n\nUpdate: an order-preserving approach is two lines:\n\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\nOrderedDict((x, True) for x in source_list).keys()\n\n\nHere we use the fact that OrderedDict remembers the insertion order of keys, and does not change it when a value at a particular key is updated. We insert True as values, but we could insert anything, values are just not used.

There&apos;s only one other solution which even has Counter in it. However, that solution is also limited to hashable keys.\nTo allow unhashable keys in Counter, I made a Container class, which will try to get the object&apos;s default hash function, but if it fails, it will try its identity function. It also defines an eq and a hash method. This should be enough to allow unhashable items in our solution. Unhashable objects will be treated as if they are hashable. However, this hash function uses identity for unhashable objects, meaning two equal objects that are both unhashable won&apos;t work. I suggest you override this, and changing it to use the hash of an equivalent mutable type (like using hash(tuple(my_list)) if my_list is a list).\nI also made two solutions. Another solution which keeps the order of the items, using a subclass of both OrderedDict and Counter which is named &apos;OrderedCounter&apos;. Now, here are the functions:\nfrom collections import OrderedDict, Counter\n\nclass Container:\n    def __init__(self, obj):\n        self.obj = obj\n    def __eq__(self, obj):\n        return self.obj == obj\n    def __hash__(self):\n        try:\n            return hash(self.obj)\n        except:\n            return id(self.obj)\n\nclass OrderedCounter(Counter, OrderedDict):\n     &apos;Counter that remembers the order elements are first encountered&apos;\n\n     def __repr__(self):\n         return &apos;%s(%r)&apos; % (self.__class__.__name__, OrderedDict(self))\n\n     def __reduce__(self):\n         return self.__class__, (OrderedDict(self),)\n    \ndef remd(sequence):\n    cnt = Counter()\n    for x in sequence:\n        cnt[Container(x)] += 1\n    return [item.obj for item in cnt]\n\ndef oremd(sequence):\n    cnt = OrderedCounter()\n    for x in sequence:\n        cnt[Container(x)] += 1\n    return [item.obj for item in cnt]\n\nremd is non-ordered sorting, while oremd is ordered sorting. You can clearly tell which one is faster, but I&apos;ll explain anyways. The non-ordered sorting is slightly faster, since it doesn&apos;t store the order of the items.\nNow, I also wanted to show the speed comparisons of each answer. So, I&apos;ll do that now.\nWhich Function is the Fastest?\nFor removing duplicates, I gathered 10 functions from a few answers. I calculated the speed of each function and put it into a graph using matplotlib.pyplot.\nI divided this into three rounds of graphing. A hashable is any object which can be hashed, an unhashable is any object which cannot be hashed. An ordered sequence is a sequence which preserves order, an unordered sequence does not preserve order. Now, here are a few more terms:\nUnordered Hashable was for any method which removed duplicates, which didn&apos;t necessarily have to keep the order. It didn&apos;t have to work for unhashables, but it could.\nOrdered Hashable was for any method which kept the order of the items in the list, but it didn&apos;t have to work for unhashables, but it could.\nOrdered Unhashable was any method which kept the order of the items in the list, and worked for unhashables.\nOn the y-axis is the amount of seconds it took.\nOn the x-axis is the number the function was applied to.\nI generated sequences for unordered hashables and ordered hashables with the following comprehension: [list(range(x)) + list(range(x)) for x in range(0, 1000, 10)]\nFor ordered unhashables: [[list(range(y)) + list(range(y)) for y in range(x)] for x in range(0, 1000, 10)]\nNote there is a step in the range because without it, this would&apos;ve taken 10x as long. Also because in my personal opinion, I thought it might&apos;ve looked a little easier to read.\nAlso note the keys on the legend are what I tried to guess as the most vital parts of the implementation of the function. As for what function does the worst or best? The graph speaks for itself.\nWith that settled, here are the graphs.\nUnordered Hashables\n\n(Zoomed in)\n\nOrdered Hashables\n\n(Zoomed in)\n\nOrdered Unhashables\n\n(Zoomed in)\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution8","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"A colleague have sent the accepted answer as part of his code to me for a codereview today.\nWhile I certainly admire the elegance of the answer in question, I am not happy with the performance.\nI have tried this solution (I use set to reduce lookup time)\n\ndef ordered_set(in_list):\n    out_list = []\n    added = set()\n    for val in in_list:\n        if not val in added:\n            out_list.append(val)\n            added.add(val)\n    return out_list\n\n\nTo compare efficiency, I used a random sample of 100 integers - 62 were unique\n\nfrom random import randint\nx = [randint(0,100) for _ in xrange(100)]\n\nIn [131]: len(set(x))\nOut[131]: 62\n\n\nHere are the results of the measurements\n\nIn [129]: %timeit list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(x))\n10000 loops, best of 3: 86.4 us per loop\n\nIn [130]: %timeit ordered_set(x)\n100000 loops, best of 3: 15.1 us per loop\n\n\nWell, what happens if set is removed from the solution?\n\ndef ordered_set(inlist):\n    out_list = []\n    for val in inlist:\n        if not val in out_list:\n            out_list.append(val)\n    return out_list\n\n\nThe result is not as bad as with the OrderedDict, but still more than 3 times of the original solution\n\nIn [136]: %timeit ordered_set(x)\n10000 loops, best of 3: 52.6 us per loop\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution9","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Very late answer.

<p>The common approach to get a unique collection of items is to use a <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset" rel="noreferrer"><code>set</code></a>. Sets are <em>unordered</em> collections of <em>distinct</em> objects. To create a set from any iterable, you can simply pass it to the built-in <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-set" rel="noreferrer"><code>set()</code></a> function. If you later need a real list again, you can similarly pass the set to the <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-list" rel="noreferrer"><code>list()</code></a> function.</p>
<p>The following example should cover whatever you are trying to do:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>t = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>, <span class="hljs-number">6</span>, <span class="hljs-number">7</span>, <span class="hljs-number">8</span>]
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">set</span>(t))
[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>, <span class="hljs-number">6</span>, <span class="hljs-number">7</span>, <span class="hljs-number">8</span>]
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>s = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>]
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">set</span>(t) - <span class="hljs-built_in">set</span>(s))
[<span class="hljs-number">8</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>, <span class="hljs-number">6</span>, <span class="hljs-number">7</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see from the example result, <em>the original order is not maintained</em>. As mentioned above, sets themselves are unordered collections, so the order is lost. When converting a set back to a list, an arbitrary order is created.</p>
<h3>Maintaining order</h3>
<p>If order is important to you, then you will have to use a different mechanism. A very common solution for this is to rely on <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict" rel="noreferrer"><code>OrderedDict</code></a> to keep the order of keys during insertion:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> collections <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> OrderedDict
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(OrderedDict.fromkeys(t))
[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>, <span class="hljs-number">6</span>, <span class="hljs-number">7</span>, <span class="hljs-number">8</span>]
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2017-December/151283.html" rel="noreferrer">Starting with Python 3.7</a>, the built-in dictionary is guaranteed to maintain the insertion order as well, so you can also use that directly if you are on Python 3.7 or later (or CPython 3.6):</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">dict</span>.fromkeys(t))
[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>, <span class="hljs-number">6</span>, <span class="hljs-number">7</span>, <span class="hljs-number">8</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this may have some overhead of creating a dictionary first, and then creating a list from it. If you dont actually need to preserve the order, youre often better off using a set, especially because it gives you a lot more operations to work with. Check out <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/480214/216074">this question</a> for more details and alternative ways to preserve the order when removing duplicates.</p>
<hr>
<p>Finally note that both the <code>set</code> as well as the <code>OrderedDict</code>/<code>dict</code> solutions require your items to be <em>hashable</em>. This usually means that they have to be immutable. If you have to deal with items that are not hashable (e.g. list objects), then you will have to use a slow approach in which you will basically have to compare every item with every other item in a nested loop.</p>

<p><strong>In Python 2.7</strong>, the new way of removing duplicates from an iterable while keeping it in the original order is:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> collections <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> OrderedDict

</code></pre>

<p><strong>In Python 3.5</strong>, the OrderedDict has a C implementation. My timings show that this is now both the fastest and shortest of the various approaches for Python 3.5.</p>

<p><strong>In Python 3.6</strong>, the regular dict became both ordered and compact.  (This feature is holds for CPython and PyPy but may not present in other implementations).  That gives us a new fastest way of deduping while retaining order:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">dict</span>.fromkeys(<span class="hljs-string">'abracadabra'</span>))

</code></pre>

<p><strong>In Python 3.7</strong>, the regular dict is guaranteed to both ordered across all implementations.  <strong>So, the shortest and fastest solution is:</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">dict</span>.fromkeys(<span class="hljs-string">'abracadabra'</span>))

<p>It's a one-liner: <code>list(set(source_list))</code> will do the trick.</p>

<p>A <code>set</code> is something that can't possibly have duplicates.</p>

<p>Update: an order-preserving approach is two lines:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> collections <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> OrderedDict
OrderedDict((x, <span class="hljs-literal">True</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> x <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> source_list).keys()
</code></pre>

<p>Here we use the fact that <code>OrderedDict</code> remembers the insertion order of keys, and does not change it when a value at a particular key is updated. We insert <code>True</code> as values, but we could insert anything, values are just not used. (<code>set</code> works a lot like a <code>dict</code> with ignored values, too.)</p>

<p>There are also solutions using Pandas and Numpy. They both return numpy array so you have to use the function <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.tolist.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>.tolist()</code></a> if you want a list.</p>

<h2>Pandas solution</h2>

<p>Using Pandas function <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.21/generated/pandas.unique.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>unique()</code></a>:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> pandas <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> pd
pd.unique(t).tolist()
&gt;&gt;&gt;[<span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>]
pd.unique(t2).tolist()
&gt;&gt;&gt;[<span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>]
</code></pre>

<h2>Numpy solution</h2>

<p>Using numpy function <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.unique.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>unique()</code></a>.</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> numpy <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> np
np.unique(t).tolist()
&gt;&gt;&gt;[<span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>]
np.unique(t2).tolist()
&gt;&gt;&gt;[<span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Note that numpy.unique() also sort the values</strong>. So the list <code>t2</code> is returned sorted. If you want to have the order preserved use as in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15637336/numpy-unique-with-order-preserved">this answer</a>:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">_, idx = np.unique(t2, return_index=<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>)
t2[np.sort(idx)].tolist()
&gt;&gt;&gt;[<span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>]

<p>The solution is not so elegant compared to the others, however, compared to pandas.unique(), numpy.unique() allows you also to check if nested arrays are unique along one selected axis.</p>

<p>In this answer, there will be two sections: Two unique solutions, and a graph of speed for specific solutions.</p>
<h2>Removing Duplicate Items</h2>
<p>Most of these answers only remove duplicate items which are <em>hashable</em>, but this question doesn't imply it doesn't just need <em>hashable</em> items, meaning I'll offer some solutions which don't require <em>hashable</em> items.</p>
<p><code>collections.Counter</code> is a powerful tool in the standard library which could be perfect for this. There's only one other solution which even has Counter in it. However, that solution is also limited to <em>hashable</em> keys.</p>
<p>To allow unhashable keys in Counter, I made a Container class, which will try to get the object's default hash function, but if it fails, it will try its identity function. It also defines an <strong>eq</strong> and a <strong>hash</strong> method. This should be enough to allow <em>unhashable</em> items in our solution. Unhashable objects will be treated as if they are hashable. However, this hash function uses identity for unhashable objects, meaning two equal objects that are both unhashable won't work. I suggest you override this, and changing it to use the hash of an equivalent mutable type (like using <code>hash(tuple(my_list))</code> if <code>my_list</code> is a list).</p>
<p>I also made two solutions. Another solution which keeps the order of the items, using a subclass of both OrderedDict and Counter which is named 'OrderedCounter'. Now, here are the functions:</p>

    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> [item.obj <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> item <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> cnt]
</code></pre>
<p><code>remd</code> is non-ordered sorting, while <code>oremd</code> is ordered sorting. You can clearly tell which one is faster, but I'll explain anyways. The non-ordered sorting is slightly faster, since it doesn't store the order of the items.</p>
<p>Now, I also wanted to show the speed comparisons of each answer. So, I'll do that now.</p>
<h2>Which Function is the Fastest?</h2>
<p>For removing duplicates, I gathered 10 functions from a few answers. I calculated the speed of each function and put it into a graph using <em>matplotlib.pyplot</em>.</p>
<p>I divided this into three rounds of graphing. A hashable is any object which can be hashed, an unhashable is any object which cannot be hashed. An ordered sequence is a sequence which preserves order, an unordered sequence does not preserve order. Now, here are a few more terms:</p>
<p><em>Unordered Hashable</em> was for any method which removed duplicates, which didn't necessarily have to keep the order. It didn't have to work for unhashables, but it could.</p>
<p><em>Ordered Hashable</em> was for any method which kept the order of the items in the list, but it didn't have to work for unhashables, but it could.</p>
<p><em>Ordered Unhashable</em> was any method which kept the order of the items in the list, and worked for unhashables.</p>
<p>On the y-axis is the amount of seconds it took.</p>
<p>On the x-axis is the number the function was applied to.</p>
<p>I generated sequences for unordered hashables and ordered hashables with the following comprehension: <code>[list(range(x)) + list(range(x)) for x in range(0, 1000, 10)]</code></p>
<p>For ordered unhashables: <code>[[list(range(y)) + list(range(y)) for y in range(x)] for x in range(0, 1000, 10)]</code></p>
<p>Note there is a <code>step</code> in the range because without it, this would've taken 10x as long. Also because in my personal opinion, I thought it might've looked a little easier to read.</p>
<p>Also note the keys on the legend are what I tried to guess as the most vital parts of the implementation of the function. As for what function does the worst or best? The graph speaks for itself.</p>
<p>With that settled, here are the graphs.</p>

<p>A colleague have sent the accepted answer as part of his code to me for a codereview today.
While I certainly admire the elegance of the answer in question, I am not happy with the performance.
I have tried this solution (I use <em>set</em> to reduce lookup time)</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">ordered_set</span>(<span class="hljs-params">in_list</span>):
    out_list = []
    added = <span class="hljs-built_in">set</span>()
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> val <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> in_list:
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> val <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> added:
            out_list.append(val)
            added.add(val)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> out_list
</code></pre>

<p>To compare efficiency, I used a random sample of 100 integers - 62 were unique</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> random <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> randint
x = [randint(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>,<span class="hljs-number">100</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> _ <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> xrange(<span class="hljs-number">100</span>)]

In [<span class="hljs-number">131</span>]: <span class="hljs-built_in">len</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">set</span>(x))
Out[<span class="hljs-number">131</span>]: <span class="hljs-number">62</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the results of the measurements</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">In [<span class="hljs-number">129</span>]: %timeit <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(OrderedDict.fromkeys(x))
<span class="hljs-number">10000</span> loops, best of <span class="hljs-number">3</span>: <span class="hljs-number">86.4</span> us per loop

In [<span class="hljs-number">130</span>]: %timeit ordered_set(x)
<span class="hljs-number">100000</span> loops, best of <span class="hljs-number">3</span>: <span class="hljs-number">15.1</span> us per loop
</code></pre>

<p>Well, what happens if set is removed from the solution?</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">ordered_set</span>(<span class="hljs-params">inlist</span>):
    out_list = []
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> val <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> inlist:
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> val <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> out_list:
            out_list.append(val)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> out_list
</code></pre>

<p>The result is not as bad as with the <em>OrderedDict</em>, but still more than 3 times of the original solution</p>

<p>If you want to preserve the order, and not use any external modules here is an easy way to do this:</p>

<p>Note: This method preserves the order of appearance, so, as seen above, nine will come after one because it was the first time it appeared. This however, is the same result as you would get with doing</p>

ulist=<span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(OrderedDict.fromkeys(l))
</code></pre>

<p>but it is much shorter, and runs faster.</p>

<p>This works because each time the <code>fromkeys</code> function tries to create a new key, if the value already exists it will simply overwrite it. This wont affect the dictionary at all however, as <code>fromkeys</code> creates a dictionary where all keys have the value <code>None</code>, so effectively it eliminates all duplicates this way.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The reason that above works is that <code>index</code> method returns only the first index of an element. Duplicate elements have higher indices. Refer to <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists" rel="noreferrer">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>list.index(x[, start[, end]])</strong><br>
  Return zero-based index in the list of
  the first item whose value is x.    Raises a ValueError if there is no
  such item.</p>

<p>I've compared the various suggestions with <a href="https://github.com/nschloe/perfplot" rel="noreferrer">perfplot</a>. It turns out that, if the input array doesn't have duplicate elements, all methods are more or less equally fast, independently of whether the input data is a Python list or a NumPy array.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bM7Qf.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bM7Qf.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>If the input array is large, but contains just one unique element, then the <code>set</code>, <code>dict</code> and <code>np.unique</code> methods are costant-time <em>if the input data is a list</em>. If it's a NumPy array, <code>np.unique</code> is about 10 times faster than the other alternatives.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/giJyZ.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/giJyZ.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>It's somewhat surprising to me that those are not constant-time operations, too.</p>

<p>There are many other answers suggesting different ways to do this, but they're all batch operations, and some of them throw away the original order. That might be okay depending on what you need, but if you want to iterate over the values in the order of the first instance of each value, and you want to remove the duplicates on-the-fly versus all at once, you could use this generator:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">uniqify</span>(<span class="hljs-params">iterable</span>):

            seen.add(item)
            <span class="hljs-keyword">yield</span> item

<p>In python, it is very easy to process the complicated cases like this and only by python's built-in type. </p>

<p>Let me show you how to do ! </p>

<p><strong>Method 1: General Case</strong> </p>

<p>The way (<em>1 line code</em>) to remove duplicated element in list and still keep sorting order</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">line = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>, <span class="hljs-number">6</span>, <span class="hljs-number">7</span>, <span class="hljs-number">8</span>]
new_line = <span class="hljs-built_in">sorted</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">set</span>(line), key=line.index) <span class="hljs-comment"># remove duplicated element</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(new_line)
</code></pre>

<p>You will get the result</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>, <span class="hljs-number">6</span>, <span class="hljs-number">7</span>, <span class="hljs-number">8</span>]

<p><strong>Method 2: Special Case</strong> </p>

There\u0026apos;s only one other solution which even has Counter in it. However, that solution is also limited to \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;hashable\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; keys.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;To allow unhashable keys in Counter, I made a Container class, which will try to get the object\u0026apos;s default hash function, but if it fails, it will try its identity function. It also defines an \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;eq\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; and a \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;hash\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; method. This should be enough to allow \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;unhashable\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; items in our solution. Unhashable objects will be treated as if they are hashable. However, this hash function uses identity for unhashable objects, meaning two equal objects that are both unhashable won\u0026apos;t work. I suggest you override this, and changing it to use the hash of an equivalent mutable type (like using \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;hash(tuple(my_list))\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; if \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;my_list\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is a list).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I also made two solutions.

is non-ordered sorting, while \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;oremd\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is ordered sorting. You can clearly tell which one is faster, but I\u0026apos;ll explain anyways. The non-ordered sorting is slightly faster, since it doesn\u0026apos;t store the order of the items.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now, I also wanted to show the speed comparisons of each answer. So, I\u0026apos;ll do that now.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Which Function is the Fastest?\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;For removing duplicates, I gathered 10 functions from a few answers. I calculated the speed of each function and put it into a graph using \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;matplotlib.pyplot\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I divided this into three rounds of graphing. A hashable is any object which can be hashed, an unhashable is any object which cannot be hashed. An ordered sequence is a sequence which preserves order, an unordered sequence does not preserve order. Now, here are a few more terms:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;Unordered Hashable\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; was for any method which removed duplicates, which didn\u0026apos;t necessarily have to keep the order. It didn\u0026apos;t have to work for unhashables, but it could.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;Ordered Hashable\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; was for any method which kept the order of the items in the list, but it didn\u0026apos;t have to work for unhashables, but it could.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;Ordered Unhashable\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; was any method which kept the order of the items in the list, and worked for unhashables.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;On the y-axis is the amount of seconds it took.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;On the x-axis is the number the function was applied to.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I generated sequences for unordered hashables and ordered hashables with the following comprehension: \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;[list(range(x)) + list(range(x)) for x in range(0, 1000, 10)]\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;For ordered unhashables: \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;[[list(range(y)) + list(range(y)) for y in range(x)] for x in range(0, 1000, 10)]\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Note there is a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;step\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; in the range because without it, this would\u0026apos;ve taken 10x as long. Also because in my personal opinion, I thought it might\u0026apos;ve looked a little easier to read.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Also note the keys on the legend are what I tried to guess as the most vital parts of the implementation of the function. As for what function does the worst or best? The graph speaks for itself.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;With that settled, here are the graphs.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Unordered Hashables\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/KlFmQ.png\u0026quot;
