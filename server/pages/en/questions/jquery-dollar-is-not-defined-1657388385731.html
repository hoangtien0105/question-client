<p>I have checked that the script is being resolved correctly, I'm able to see the markup and view the script directly in firebug, so I must be being found. However, I am still getting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>$ is not defined</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and none of the jquery works. I've also tried the various variations of this like <code>$(document).ready</code> and jQuery etc.</p>
<p>It's an MVC 2 app on .net 3.5, I'm sure I'm being really dense, everywhere on google says to check the file is referenced correctly, which I have checked and checked again, please advise! :/</p>

<p>That error can only be caused by one of three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your JavaScript file is not being properly loaded into your page</li>
<li>You have a botched version of jQuery.  This could happen because someone edited the core file, or a plugin may have overwritten the $ variable.</li>
<li>You have JavaScript running before the page is fully loaded, and as such, before jQuery is fully loaded.</li>
</ol>

<p>First of all, ensure, what script is call properly, it should looks like</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;script src=<span class="hljs-string">"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"</span> type=<span class="hljs-string">"text/javascript"</span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and shouldn't have attributes <strong>async</strong> or <strong>defer</strong>.</p>

<p>Then you should check the <a href="http://getfirebug.com/" rel="noreferrer">Firebug</a> <em>net</em> panel to see if the file is actually being loaded properly.  If not, it will be highlighted red and will say "404" beside it.  If the file is loading properly, that means that the issue is number 2.</p>

<p>Make sure all jQuery javascript code is being run inside a code block such as:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$(<span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">ready</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
  <span class="hljs-comment">//your code here</span>
});
</code></pre>

<p>This will ensure that your code is being loaded <strong>after</strong> jQuery has been initialized.</p>

<p>One final thing to check is to make sure that you are not loading any plugins <strong>before</strong> you load jQuery.  Plugins extend the "$" object, so if you load a plugin before loading jQuery core, then you'll get the error you described.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you're loading code which does not require jQuery to run it does not need to be placed inside the jQuery ready handler. That code may be separated using <a href="http://devdocs.io/dom/document/readystate" rel="noreferrer"><code>document.readyState</code></a>.</p>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution2" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl solution-inner border md:px-10 md:py-10 px-2 py-10 shadow-md bg-white"><div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-between"><h1 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 2</h1><div class="tags-wrap h-max space-x-8"><div class="tags"></div></div></div><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>It could be that you have your script tag called before the jquery script is called.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;script type=<span class="hljs-string">"text/javascript"</span> src=<span class="hljs-string">"js/script.js"</span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

<span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span> <span class="hljs-attr">src</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"text/javascript"</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>

<p><strong>This results as $ is not defined</strong></p>

<p>Put the jquery.js before your script tag  and it will work ;) like so:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;script src=<span class="hljs-string">"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"</span> type=<span class="hljs-string">"text/javascript"</span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

<p>First you need to make sure that jQuery script is loaded. This could be from a CDN or local on your website.  If you don't load this first before trying to use jQuery it will tell you that jQuery is not defined. </p>

<p>If the jQuery plugin call is next to the <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>, and your script is loaded before that, you should make your code run after <code>window.onload</code> event, like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-variable language_">window</span>.<span class="hljs-property">onload</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {

}
</code></pre>

<p>`</p>

<p>so, your code will run only after the window load, when all assets have been loaded. In that point, the jQuery (<code>$</code>) will be defined.</p>

<p>If you use that:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$(<span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">ready</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {

});
</code></pre>

<p>`</p>

<p>the <code>$</code> isn't yet defined at this time, because it is called before the jQuery is loaded, and your script will fail on that first line on console.</p>

<p>It sounds like jQuery isn't loading properly. Which source/version are you using?</p>

<p>Alternatively, it could a be namespace collision, so try using jQuery explicitly instead of using <code>$</code>. If that works, you may like to use <code>noConflict</code> to ensure the other code that's using <code>$</code> doesn't break.</p>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution15" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl solution-inner border md:px-10 md:py-10 px-2 py-10 shadow-md bg-white"><div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-between"><h1 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 15</h1><div class="tags-wrap h-max space-x-8"><div class="tags"></div></div></div><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>That error means that jQuery has not yet loaded on the page.  Using <code>$(document).ready(...)</code> or any variant thereof will do no good, as <code>$</code> is the jQuery function.</p>

<p>Using <code>window.onload</code> should work here.  Note that only one function can be assigned to <code>window.onload</code>.  To avoid losing the original onload logic, you can decorate the original function like so:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">originalOnload = <span class="hljs-variable language_">window</span>.<span class="hljs-property">onload</span>;
<span class="hljs-variable language_">window</span>.<span class="hljs-property">onload</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (originalOnload) {
    <span class="hljs-title function_">originalOnload</span>();
  }
  <span class="hljs-comment">// YOUR JQUERY</span>
};
</code></pre>

<p>This will execute the function that was originally assigned to <code>window.onload</code>, and then will execute <code>// YOUR JQUERY</code>.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern</a> for more detail about the decorator pattern.</p>

<p>In the solution it is mentioned - 
"One final thing to check is to make sure that you are not loading any plugins before you load jQuery. Plugins extend the "$" object, so if you load a plugin before loading jQuery core, then you'll get the error you described."</p>

<p>For avoiding this - </p>

<p>Many JavaScript libraries use $ as a function or variable name, just as jQuery does. In jQuery's case, $ is just an alias for jQuery, so all functionality is available without using $. If we need to use another JavaScript library alongside jQuery, we can return control of $ back to the other library with a call to $.noConflict():</p>

<p>I was having this same problem and couldn't figure out what was causing it. I recently converted my HTML files from Japanese to UTF-8, but I didn't do anything with the script files. Somehow jquery-1.10.2.min.js became corrupted in this process (I still have no idea how). Replacing jquery-1.10.2.min.js with the original fixed it.</p>

<p>it appears that if you locate your jquery.js files under the same folder or in some subfolders where your html file is, the Firebug problem is solved. eg if your html is under C:/folder1/, then your js files should be somewhere under C:/folder1/ (or C:/folder1/folder2 etc) as well and addressed accordingly in the html doc. hope this helps.</p>

<p>I had a very similar issue. In my C# MVC application, JQuery was not being recognized. I needed to move the @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/jquery") from the bottom of my _Layout.cshtml file to the head of the section.
