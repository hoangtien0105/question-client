When a web application is loaded, the servlet container creates the ServletContext once and keeps it in the server&apos;s memory. The web app&apos;s web.xml and all of included web-fragment.xml files is parsed, and each &lt;servlet&gt;, &lt;filter&gt; and &lt;listener&gt; found (or each class annotated with @WebServlet, @WebFilter and @WebListener respectively) will be instantiated once and be kept in the server&apos;s memory as well, registred via the ServletContext. For each instantiated filter, its init() method is invoked with a new FilterConfig argument which in turn contains the involved ServletContext.\nWhen a Servlet has a &lt;servlet&gt;&lt;load-on-startup&gt; or @WebServlet(loadOnStartup) value greater than 0, then its init() method is also invoked during startup with a new ServletConfig argument which in turn contains the involved ServletContext. Those servlets are initialized in the same order specified by that value (1 is 1st, 2 is 2nd, etc). If the same value is specified for more than one servlet, then each of those servlets is loaded in the same order as they appear in the web.xml, web-fragment.xml, or @WebServlet classloading. In the event the &quot;load-on-startup&quot; value is absent, the init() method will be invoked whenever the HTTP request hits that servlet for the very first time.\nWhen the servlet container is finished with all of the above described initialization steps, then the ServletContextListener#contextInitialized() will be invoked with a ServletContextEvent argument which in turn contains the involved ServletContext. This will allow the developer the opportunity to programmatically register yet another Servlet, Filter or Listener.\nWhen the servlet container shuts down, it unloads all web applications, invokes the destroy() method of all its initialized servlets and filters, and all Servlet, Filter and Listener instances registered via the ServletContext are trashed. Finally the ServletContextListener#contextDestroyed() will be invoked and the ServletContext itself will be trashed.\nHttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse\nThe servlet container is attached to a web server that listens for HTTP requests on a certain port number (port 8080 is usually used during development and port 80 in production). When a client (e.g. user with a web browser, or programmatically using URLConnection) sends an HTTP request, the servlet container creates new HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse objects and passes them through any defined Filter in the chain and, eventually, the Servlet instance.\nIn the case of filters, the doFilter() method is invoked. When the servlet container&apos;s code calls chain.doFilter(request, response), the request and response continue on to the next filter, or hit the servlet if there are no remaining filters.\nIn the case of servlets, the service() method is invoked. By default, this method determines which one of the doXxx() methods to invoke based off of  request.getMethod(). If the determined method is absent from the servlet, then an HTTP 405 error is returned in the response.\nThe request object provides access to all of the information about the HTTP request, such as its URL, headers, query string and body. The response object provides the ability to control and send the HTTP response the way you want by, for instance, allowing you to set the headers and the body (usually with generated HTML content from a JSP file). When the HTTP response is committed and finished, both the request and response objects are recycled and made available for reuse.\nHttpSession\nWhen a client visits the webapp for the first time and/or the HttpSession is obtained for the first time via request.getSession(), the servlet container creates a new HttpSession object, generates a long and unique ID (which you can get by session.getId()), and stores it in the server&apos;s memory. The servlet container also sets a Cookie in the Set-Cookie header of the HTTP response with JSESSIONID as its name and the unique session ID as its value.\nAs per the HTTP cookie specification (a contract any decent web browser and web server must adhere to), the client (the web browser) is required to send this cookie back in subsequent requests in the Cookie header for as long as the cookie is valid (i.e. the unique ID must refer to an unexpired session and the domain and path are correct). Using your browser&apos;s built-in HTTP traffic monitor, you can verify that the cookie is valid (press F12 in Chrome / Firefox 23+ / IE9+, and check the Net/Network tab). The servlet container will check the Cookie header of every incoming HTTP request for the presence of the cookie with the name JSESSIONID and use its value (the session ID) to get the associated HttpSession from server&apos;s memory.\nThe HttpSession stays alive until it has been idle (i.e. not used in a request) for more than the timeout value specified in &lt;session-timeout&gt;, a setting in web.xml. The timeout value defaults to 30 minutes. So, when the client doesn&apos;t visit the web app for longer than the time specified, the servlet container trashes the session. Every subsequent request, even with the cookie specified, will not have access to the same session anymore; the servlet container will create a new session.\nOn the client side, the session cookie stays alive for as long as the browser instance is running. So, if the client closes the browser instance (all tabs/windows), then the session is trashed on the client&apos;s side. In a new browser instance, the cookie associated with the session wouldn&apos;t exist, so it would no longer be sent. This causes an entirely new HttpSession to be created, with an entirely new session cookie being used.\nIn a nutshell\n\nThe ServletContext lives for as long as the web app lives. It is shared among all requests in all sessions.\nThe HttpSession lives for as long as the client is interacting with the web app with the same browser instance, and the session hasn&apos;t timed out at the server side. It is shared among all requests in the same session.\nThe HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse live from the time the servlet receives an HTTP request from the client, until the complete response (the web page) has arrived. It is not shared elsewhere.\nAll Servlet, Filter and Listener instances live as long as the web app lives. They are shared among all requests in all sessions.\nAny attribute that is defined in ServletContext, HttpServletRequest and HttpSession will live as long as the object in question lives. The object itself represents the &quot;scope&quot; in bean management frameworks such as JSF, CDI, Spring, etc. Those frameworks store their scoped beans as an attribute of its closest matching scope.\n\nThread Safety\nThat said, your major concern is possibly thread safety. You should now know that servlets and filters are shared among all requests. That&apos;s the nice thing about Java, it&apos;s multithreaded and different threads (read: HTTP requests) can make use of the same instance. It would otherwise be too expensive to recreate, init() and destroy() them for every single request.\nYou should also realize that you should never assign any request or session scoped data as an instance variable of a servlet or filter. It will be shared among all other requests in other sessions. That&apos;s not thread-safe! The below example illustrates this:\npublic class ExampleServlet extends HttpServlet {\n\n    private Object thisIsNOTThreadSafe;\n\n    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\n        Object thisIsThreadSafe;\n\n        thisIsNOTThreadSafe = request.getParameter(&quot;foo&quot;); // BAD!! Shared among all requests!\n        thisIsThreadSafe = request.getParameter(&quot;foo&quot;); // OK, this is thread safe.\n    } \n}\n\nSee also:\n\nWhat is the difference between JSF, Servlet and JSP?\nBest option for Session management in Java\nDifference between / and /* in servlet mapping url pattern\ndoGet and doPost in Servlets\nServlet seems to handle multiple concurrent browser requests synchronously\nWhy Servlets are not thread Safe?\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Sessions\n\n\n\n\nIn short: the web server issues a unique identifier to each visitor on his first visit. The visitor must bring back that ID for him to be recognised next time around. This identifier also allows the server to properly segregate objects owned by one session against that of another.\n\nServlet Instantiation\n\nIf load-on-startup is false:\n\n\n\n\nIf load-on-startup is true:\n\n\n\n\nOnce he&apos;s on the service mode and on the groove, the same servlet will work on the requests from all other clients. \n\n\n\nWhy isn&apos;t it a good idea to have one instance per client? Think about this: Will you hire one pizza guy for every order that came? Do that and you&apos;d be out of business in no time.\n\nIt comes with a small risk though. Remember: this single guy holds all the order information in his pocket: so if you&apos;re not cautious about thread safety on servlets, he may end up giving the wrong order to a certain client.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Session in Java servlets is the same as session in other languages such as PHP.  It is unique to the user.  The server can keep track of it in different ways such as cookies, url rewriting etc.  This Java doc article explains it in the context of Java servlets and indicates that exactly how session is maintained is an implementation detail left to the designers of the server.  The specification only stipulates that it must be maintained as unique to a user across multiple connections to the server.  Check out this article from Oracle for more information about both of your questions.\n\nEdit There is an excellent tutorial here on how to work with session inside of servlets. And here is a chapter from Sun about Java Servlets, what they are and how to use them.

<h2><code>ServletContext</code></h2>
<p>When the servlet container (like <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org" rel="noreferrer">Apache Tomcat</a>) starts up, it will deploy and load all its web applications. When a web application is loaded, the servlet container creates the <a href="https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/ServletContext.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>ServletContext</code></a> once and keeps it in the server's memory. The web app's <code>web.xml</code> and all of included <code>web-fragment.xml</code> files is parsed, and each <code>&lt;servlet&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;filter&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;listener&gt;</code> found (or each class annotated with <code>@WebServlet</code>, <code>@WebFilter</code> and <code>@WebListener</code> respectively) will be instantiated once and be kept in the server's memory as well, registred via the <code>ServletContext</code>. For each instantiated filter, its <code>init()</code> method is invoked with a new <a href="https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/FilterConfig.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>FilterConfig</code></a> argument which in turn contains the involved <code>ServletContext</code>.</p>
<p>When a <code>Servlet</code> has a <code>&lt;servlet&gt;&lt;load-on-startup&gt;</code> or <code>@WebServlet(loadOnStartup)</code> value greater than <code>0</code>, then its <code>init()</code> method is also invoked during startup with a new <a href="https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/ServletConfig.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>ServletConfig</code></a> argument which in turn contains the involved <code>ServletContext</code>. Those servlets are initialized in the same order specified by that value (<code>1</code> is 1st, <code>2</code> is 2nd, etc). If the same value is specified for more than one servlet, then each of those servlets is loaded in the same order as they appear in the <code>web.xml</code>, <code>web-fragment.xml</code>, or <code>@WebServlet</code> classloading. In the event the "load-on-startup" value is absent, the <code>init()</code> method will be invoked whenever the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_message" rel="noreferrer">HTTP request</a> hits that servlet for the very first time.</p>
<p>When the servlet container is finished with all of the above described initialization steps, then the <a href="https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/ServletContextListener.html#contextInitialized-javax.servlet.ServletContextEvent-" rel="noreferrer"><code>ServletContextListener#contextInitialized()</code></a> will be invoked with a <code>ServletContextEvent</code> argument which in turn contains the involved <code>ServletContext</code>. This will allow the developer the opportunity to programmatically register yet another <code>Servlet</code>, <code>Filter</code> or <code>Listener</code>.</p>
<p>When the servlet container shuts down, it unloads all web applications, invokes the <code>destroy()</code> method of all its initialized servlets and filters, and all <code>Servlet</code>, <code>Filter</code> and <code>Listener</code> instances registered via the <code>ServletContext</code> are trashed. Finally the <a href="https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/ServletContextListener.html#contextDestroyed-javax.servlet.ServletContextEvent-" rel="noreferrer"><code>ServletContextListener#contextDestroyed()</code></a> will be invoked and the <code>ServletContext</code> itself will be trashed.</p>
<h2><code>HttpServletRequest</code> and <code>HttpServletResponse</code></h2>
<p>The servlet container is attached to a web server that listens for HTTP requests on a certain port number (port 8080 is usually used during development and port 80 in production). When a client (e.g. user with a web browser, or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2793150/how-to-use-java-net-urlconnection-to-fire-and-handle-http-requests">programmatically using <code>URLConnection</code></a>) sends an HTTP request, the servlet container creates new <a href="https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletRequest.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>HttpServletRequest</code></a> and <a href="https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>HttpServletResponse</code></a> objects and passes them through any defined <code>Filter</code> in the chain and, eventually, the <code>Servlet</code> instance.</p>
<p>In the case of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlet-filters/info">filters</a>, the <code>doFilter()</code> method is invoked. When the servlet container's code calls <code>chain.doFilter(request, response)</code>, the request and response continue on to the next filter, or hit the servlet if there are no remaining filters.</p>
<p>In the case of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlets/info">servlets</a>, the <code>service()</code> method is invoked. By default, this method determines which one of the <code>doXxx()</code> methods to invoke based off of  <code>request.getMethod()</code>. If the determined method is absent from the servlet, then an HTTP 405 error is returned in the response.</p>
<p>The request object provides access to all of the information about the HTTP request, such as its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL" rel="noreferrer">URL</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields" rel="noreferrer">headers</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string" rel="noreferrer">query string</a> and body. The response object provides the ability to control and send the HTTP response the way you want by, for instance, allowing you to set the headers and the body (usually with generated HTML content from a JSP file). When the HTTP response is committed and finished, both the request and response objects are recycled and made available for reuse.</p>
<h2><code>HttpSession</code></h2>
<p>When a client visits the webapp for the first time and/or the <a href="https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/http/HttpSession.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>HttpSession</code></a> is obtained for the first time via <code>request.getSession()</code>, the servlet container creates a new <code>HttpSession</code> object, generates a long and unique ID (which you can get by <code>session.getId()</code>), and stores it in the server's memory. The servlet container also sets a <a href="https://javaee.github.io/javaee-spec/javadocs/javax/servlet/http/Cookie.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>Cookie</code></a> in the <code>Set-Cookie</code> header of the HTTP response with <code>JSESSIONID</code> as its name and the unique session ID as its value.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2965.html" rel="noreferrer">HTTP cookie specification</a> (a contract any decent web browser and web server must adhere to), the client (the web browser) is required to send this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie" rel="noreferrer">cookie</a> back in subsequent requests in the <code>Cookie</code> header for as long as the cookie is valid (i.e. the unique ID must refer to an unexpired session and the domain and path are correct). Using your browser's built-in HTTP traffic monitor, you can verify that the cookie is valid (press F12 in Chrome / Firefox 23+ / IE9+, and check the <em>Net/Network</em> tab). The servlet container will check the <code>Cookie</code> header of every incoming HTTP request for the presence of the cookie with the name <code>JSESSIONID</code> and use its value (the session ID) to get the associated <code>HttpSession</code> from server's memory.</p>
<p>The <code>HttpSession</code> stays alive until it has been idle (i.e. not used in a request) for more than the timeout value specified in <code>&lt;session-timeout&gt;</code>, a setting in <code>web.xml</code>. The timeout value defaults to 30 minutes. So, when the client doesn't visit the web app for longer than the time specified, the servlet container trashes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#HTTP_session" rel="noreferrer">session</a>. Every subsequent request, even with the cookie specified, will not have access to the same session anymore; the servlet container will create a new session.</p>
<p>On the client side, the session cookie stays alive for as long as the browser instance is running. So, if the client closes the browser instance (all tabs/windows), then the session is trashed on the client's side. In a new browser instance, the cookie associated with the session wouldn't exist, so it would no longer be sent. This causes an entirely new <code>HttpSession</code> to be created, with an entirely new session cookie being used.</p>
<h2>In a nutshell</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>ServletContext</code> lives for as long as the web app lives. It is shared among <em>all</em> requests in <em>all</em> sessions.</li>
<li>The <code>HttpSession</code> lives for as long as the client is interacting with the web app with the same browser instance, and the session hasn't timed out at the server side. It is shared among <em>all</em> requests in the <em>same</em> session.</li>
<li>The <code>HttpServletRequest</code> and <code>HttpServletResponse</code> live from the time the servlet receives an HTTP request from the client, until the complete response (the web page) has arrived. It is <em>not</em> shared elsewhere.</li>
<li>All <code>Servlet</code>, <code>Filter</code> and <code>Listener</code> instances live as long as the web app lives. They are shared among <em>all</em> requests in <em>all</em> sessions.</li>
<li>Any <code>attribute</code> that is defined in <code>ServletContext</code>, <code>HttpServletRequest</code> and <code>HttpSession</code> will live as long as the object in question lives. The object itself represents the "scope" in bean management frameworks such as JSF, CDI, Spring, etc. Those frameworks store their scoped beans as an <code>attribute</code> of its closest matching scope.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thread Safety</h2>
<p>That said, your major concern is possibly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_safety" rel="noreferrer"><em>thread safety</em></a>. You should now know that servlets and filters are shared among all requests. That's the nice thing about Java, it's multithreaded and different threads (read: HTTP requests) can make use of the same instance. It would otherwise be too expensive to recreate, <code>init()</code> and <code>destroy()</code> them for every single request.</p>
<p>You should also realize that you should <strong>never</strong> assign any request or session scoped data as an <em>instance</em> variable of a servlet or filter. It will be shared among all other requests in other sessions. That's <strong>not</strong> thread-safe! The below example illustrates this:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">ExampleServlet</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">extends</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">HttpServlet</span> {

    <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> Object thisIsNOTThreadSafe;

    <span class="hljs-keyword">protected</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">doGet</span><span class="hljs-params">(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">throws</span> ServletException, IOException {
        Object thisIsThreadSafe;

        thisIsNOTThreadSafe = request.getParameter(<span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// BAD!! Shared among all requests!</span>
        thisIsThreadSafe = request.getParameter(<span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// OK, this is thread safe.</span>
    } 
}
</code></pre>

<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IWAF3.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>In short: the web server issues a unique identifier to <em>each visitor</em> on his <em>first</em> visit. The visitor must bring back that ID for him to be recognised next time around. This identifier also allows the server to properly segregate objects owned by one session against that of another.</p>

<p>Why isn't it a good idea to have one instance per client? Think about this: Will you hire one pizza guy for every order that came? Do that and you'd be out of business in no time.</p>

<p>It comes with a small risk though.

<p>Session in Java servlets is the same as session in other languages such as PHP.  It is unique to the user.  The server can keep track of it in different ways such as cookies, url rewriting etc.  This <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/servlet/2.2/javadoc/javax/servlet/http/HttpSession.html" rel="noreferrer">Java doc</a> article explains it in the context of Java servlets and indicates that exactly how session is maintained is an implementation detail left to the designers of the server.  The specification only stipulates that it must be maintained as unique to a user across multiple connections to the server.  Check out <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/A97336_01/buslog.102/a83726/tecbkgn2.htm" rel="noreferrer">this article from Oracle</a> for more information about both of your questions.</p>

<p>When the servlet container (like Apache Tomcat) starts up, it will read from the web.xml file (only one per application) if anything goes wrong or shows up an error at container side console, otherwise, it will deploy and load all web applications by using web.xml (so named it as deployment descriptor).</p>
<p>During instantiation phase of the servlet, servlet instance is ready but it cannot serve the client request because it is missing with two pieces of information:<br>
1: context information<br>
2: initial configuration information</p>
<p>Servlet engine creates servletConfig interface object encapsulating the above missing information into it
servlet engine calls init() of the servlet by supplying servletConfig object references as an argument. Once init() is completely executed servlet is ready to serve the client request.</p>
<h3>Q) In the lifetime of servlet how many times instantiation and initialization happens ??</h3>
<p>A)only once (for every client request a new thread is created)
only one instance of the servlet serves any number of the client request ie, after serving one client request server does not die. It waits for other client requests ie what CGI (for every client request a new process is created) limitation is overcome with the servlet (internally servlet engine creates the thread).</p>
<h3>Q)How session concept works?</h3>
<p>A)whenever getSession() is called on HttpServletRequest object</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: request object is evaluated for incoming session ID.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: if ID not available a brand new HttpSession object is created and its corresponding session ID is generated (ie of HashTable) session ID is stored into httpservlet response object and the reference of HttpSession object is returned to the servlet (doGet/doPost).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: if ID available brand new session object is not created session ID is picked up from the request object search is made in the collection of sessions by using session ID as the key.</p>
<p>Once the search is successful session ID is stored into HttpServletResponse and the existing session object references are returned to the doGet() or doPost() of UserDefineservlet.</p>
<h3>Note:</h3>
<p>1)when control leaves from servlet code to client don't forget that session object is being held by servlet container ie, the servlet engine</p>
<p>2)multithreading is left to servlet developers people for implementing ie., handle the multiple requests of client nothing to bother about multithread code</p>
<h3>Inshort form:</h3>
<p>A servlet is created when the application starts (it is deployed on the servlet container) or when it is first accessed (depending on the load-on-startup setting)
when the servlet is instantiated, the init() method of the servlet is called
then the servlet (its one and only instance) handles all requests (its service() method being called by multiple threads). That's why it is not advisable to have any synchronization in it, and you should avoid instance variables of the servlet
when the application is undeployed (the servlet container stops), the destroy() method is called.</p>

<p><strong>Sessions</strong> - what Chris Thompson said.</p>

<p><strong>Instantiation</strong> - a servlet is instantiated when the container receives the first request mapped to the servlet (unless the servlet is configured to load on startup with the <code>&lt;load-on-startup&gt;</code> element in <code>web.xml</code>).

<p>The Servlet Specification <strong>JSR-315</strong> clearly defines the web container behavior in the service (and doGet, doPost, doPut etc.) methods (2.3.3.1 Multithreading Issues, Page 9):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A servlet container may send concurrent requests through the service
  method of the servlet. To handle the requests, the Servlet Developer
  must make adequate provisions for concurrent processing with multiple
  threads in the service method.</p>
  
  <p>Although it is not recommended, an alternative for the Developer is to
  implement the SingleThreadModel interface which requires the container
  to guarantee that there is only one request thread at a time in the
  service method. A servlet container may satisfy this requirement by
  serializing requests on a servlet, or by maintaining a pool of servlet
  instances. If the servlet is part of a Web application that has been
  marked as distributable, the container may maintain a pool of servlet
  instances in each JVM that the application is distributed across.</p>
  
  <p>For servlets not implementing the SingleThreadModel interface, if the
  service method (or methods such as doGet or doPost which are
  dispatched to the service method of the HttpServlet abstract class)
  has been defined with the synchronized keyword, the servlet container
  cannot use the instance pool approach, but must serialize requests
  through it. It is strongly recommended that Developers not synchronize
  the service method (or methods dispatched to it) in these
  circumstances because of detrimental effects on performance</p>

<p><strong>No.</strong> Servlets are <strong>not Thread safe</strong></p>

<p>This is allows accessing more than one threads at a time</p>

<p><strong>if u want to make it Servlet as Thread safe ., U can go for</strong></p>

<p><code>Implement SingleThreadInterface(i)</code> 
which is a blank Interface there is no</p>

<p>methods</p>

<p>or we can go for synchronize methods</p>

<p>we can make whole service method as synchronized by using synchronized</p>

<p>keyword in front of method</p>

<p><strong>Example::</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> Synchronized <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">service</span>(ServletRequest request,ServletResponse response)<span class="hljs-keyword">throws</span> ServletException,IOException
</code></pre>

<p>or we can the put block of the code in the Synchronized block</p>

<p><strong>Example::</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">Synchronized(Object)

{

----Instructions-----

}
</code></pre>

<p>I feel that Synchronized block is better than making the whole method</p>

<p>As is clear from above explanations, by implementing the <b>SingleThreadModel</b>, a servlet can be assured thread-safety by the servlet container. The container implementation can do this in 2 ways:</p>

<p>1) Serializing requests (queuing) to a single instance - this is similar to a servlet NOT implementing SingleThreadModel BUT synchronizing the service/ doXXX methods; OR</p>

<p>2) Creating a pool of instances - which's a better option and a trade-off between the boot-up/initialization effort/time of the servlet as against the restrictive parameters (memory/ CPU time) of the environment hosting the servlet.</p>

So, when the client doesn\u0026apos;t visit the web app for longer than the time specified, the servlet container trashes the \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#HTTP_session\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;session\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.

So, if the client closes the browser instance (all tabs/windows), then the session is trashed on the client\u0026apos;s side. In a new browser instance, the cookie associated with the session wouldn\u0026apos;t exist, so it would no longer be sent.

A servlet container may satisfy this requirement by\n  serializing requests on a servlet, or by maintaining a pool of servlet\n  instances.
