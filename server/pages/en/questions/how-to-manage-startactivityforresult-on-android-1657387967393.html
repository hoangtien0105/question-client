ActivityResultContracts.TakePicture() is one of the built-in helpers which Google have created for us, and finally invoking takePicture actually triggers the Intent in the same way that you would previously with Activity.startActivityForResult(intent, REQUEST_CODE).\nHow to write a custom contract\nA simple contract that takes an Int as an input and returns a string that the requested Activity returns in the result Intent.\nclass MyContract : ActivityResultContract&lt;Int, String&gt;() {\n\n    companion object {\n        const val ACTION = &quot;com.myapp.action.MY_ACTION&quot;\n        const val INPUT_INT = &quot;input_int&quot;\n        const val OUTPUT_STRING = &quot;output_string&quot;\n    }\n\n    override fun createIntent(input: Int): Intent {\n        return Intent(ACTION)\n            .apply { putExtra(INPUT_INT, input) }\n    }\n\n    override fun parseResult(resultCode: Int, intent: Intent?): String? {\n        return when (resultCode) {\n            Activity.RESULT_OK -&gt; intent?.getStringExtra(OUTPUT_STRING)\n            else -&gt; null\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass MyActivity : AppCompatActivity() {\n\n    private val myActionCall = prepareCall(MyContract()) { result -&gt;\n        Log.i(&quot;MyActivity&quot;, &quot;Obtained result: $result&quot;)\n    }\n\n    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\n        ...\n        button.setOnClickListener {\n            myActionCall(500)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nCheck this official documentation for more information.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution7","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"If you want to update the user interface with the activity result, you can&apos;t to use this.runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {}.

<p>In my activity, I'm calling a second activity from the main activity by <code>startActivityForResult</code>. In my second activity, there are some methods that finish this activity (maybe without a result), however, just one of them returns a result.</p>
<p>For example, from the main activity, I call a second one. In this activity, I'm checking some features of a handset, such as does it have a camera. If it doesn't have then I'll close this activity. Also, during the preparation of <code>MediaRecorder</code> or <code>MediaPlayer</code> if a problem happens then I'll close this activity.</p>
<p>If its device has a camera and recording is done completely, then after recording a video if a user clicks on the done button then I'll send the result (address of the recorded video) back to the main activity.</p>
<p>How do I check the result from the main activity?</p>

<h2>The ActivityResultRegistry is the recommended approach</h2>
<p><code>ComponentActivity</code> now provides an <code>ActivityResultRegistry</code> that lets you handle the <code>startActivityForResult()</code>+<code>onActivityResult()</code> as well as <code>requestPermissions()</code>+<code>onRequestPermissionsResult()</code> flows without overriding methods in your <code>Activity</code> or <code>Fragment</code>, brings increased type safety via <code>ActivityResultContract</code>, and provides hooks for testing these flows.</p>
<p>It is strongly recommended to use the Activity Result APIs introduced in Android&nbsp;10 Activity 1.2.0-alpha02 and Fragment 1.3.0-alpha02.</p>
<p>Add this to your <code>build.gradle</code></p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-kotlin">def activity_version = <span class="hljs-string">"1.2.0-beta01"</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">// Java language implementation</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">// Kotlin</span>
implementation <span class="hljs-string">"androidx.activity:activity-ktx:<span class="hljs-variable">$activity_version</span>"</span>
</code></pre>
<h2>How to use the pre-built contract</h2>
<p>This new API has the following pre-built functionalities</p>
<ol>
<li>TakeVideo</li>
<li>PickContact</li>
<li>GetContent</li>
<li>GetContents</li>
<li>OpenDocument</li>
<li>OpenDocuments</li>
<li>OpenDocumentTree</li>
<li>CreateDocument</li>
<li>Dial</li>
<li>TakePicture</li>
<li>RequestPermission</li>
<li>RequestPermissions</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>An example that uses the takePicture contract:</strong></p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-kotlin"><span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">val</span> takePicture = prepareCall(ActivityResultContracts.TakePicture()) { bitmap: Bitmap? -&gt;
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Do something with the Bitmap, if present</span>
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">override</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">fun</span> <span class="hljs-title">onCreate</span><span class="hljs-params">(savedInstanceState: <span class="hljs-type">Bundle</span>?)</span></span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">super</span>.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)

    button.setOnClickListener { takePicture() }
}
</code></pre>
<p>So whats going on here? Lets break it down slightly. <code>takePicture</code> is just a callback which returns a nullable Bitmap - whether or not its null depends on whether or not the <code>onActivityResult</code> process was successful. <code>prepareCall</code> then registers this call into a new feature on <code>ComponentActivity</code> called the <code>ActivityResultRegistry</code> - well come back to this later. <code>ActivityResultContracts.TakePicture()</code> is one of the built-in helpers which Google have created for us, and finally invoking <code>takePicture</code> actually triggers the Intent in the same way that you would previously with <code>Activity.startActivityForResult(intent, REQUEST_CODE)</code>.</p>
<h2>How to write a custom contract</h2>
<p>A simple contract that takes an Int as an <em>input</em> and returns a string that the requested Activity returns in the result Intent.</p>

<p>It is a very common problem on Android</p>
<p><strong>It can be broken down into three pieces</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Start Activity B (happens in Activity A)</li>
<li>Set requested data  (happens in activity B)</li>
<li>Receive requested data (happens in activity A)</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>startActivity B</li>
</ol>

startActivity(i);
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>Set requested data</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>In this part, you decide whether you want to send data back or not when a particular event occurs.</p>
<p>E.g.: In activity B there is an EditText and two buttons b1, b2.
Clicking on Button b1 sends data back to activity A.
Clicking on Button b2 does not send any data.</p>
<p><strong>Sending data</strong></p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">b1......clickListener

    resultIntent.putExtra(<span class="hljs-string">"Your_key"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Your_value"</span>);
