So with Object something = ..., something is really an address in memory (a number).)\n\n== compares the exact values. So it compares if the primitive values are the same, or if the references (addresses) are the same. That&apos;s why == often doesn&apos;t work on Strings; Strings are objects, and doing == on two string variables just compares if the address is same in memory, as others have pointed out. .equals() calls the comparison method of objects, which will compare the actual objects pointed by the references. In the case of Strings, it compares each character to see if they&apos;re equal.\n\n\n\nThe interesting part:\n\nSo why does == sometimes return true for Strings? Note that Strings are immutable. In your code, if you do\n\nString foo = &quot;hi&quot;;\nString bar = &quot;hi&quot;;\n\n\nSince strings are immutable (when you call .trim() or something, it produces a new string, not modifying the original object pointed to in memory), you don&apos;t really need two different String(&quot;hi&quot;) objects. If the compiler is smart, the bytecode will read to only generate one String(&quot;hi&quot;) object. So if you do \n\nif (foo == bar) ...\n\n\nright after, they&apos;re pointing to the same object, and will return true. But you rarely intend this. Instead, you&apos;re asking for user input, which is creating new strings at different parts of memory, etc. etc.\n\nNote: If you do something like baz = new String(bar) the compiler may still figure out they&apos;re the same thing. But the main point is when the compiler sees literal strings, it can easily optimize same strings.\n\nI don&apos;t know how it works in runtime, but I assume the JVM doesn&apos;t keep a list of &quot;live strings&quot; and check if a same string exists.

<p>The function checks the actual contents of the string, the <code>==</code> operator checks whether the references to the objects are equal.

<h2>Meet Jorman</h2>

<p>Jorman is a successful businessman and has 2 houses. </p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xLcfG.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>But others don't know that.</p>

<h2>Is it the same Jorman?</h2>

<p>When you ask neighbours from either Madison or Burke streets, this is the only thing they can say:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZjMlG.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Using the residence alone, it's tough to confirm that it's the same Jorman. Since they're 2 different addresses, it's just natural to assume that those are 2 different persons.</p>

<p><strong>That's how the operator <code>==</code> behaves.</strong> So it will say that <code>datos[0]==usuario</code> is false, because it only <em>compares the addresses</em>.</p>

<h2>An Investigator to the Rescue</h2>

<p>What if we sent an investigator? We know that it's the same Jorman, but we need to prove it. Our detective will look closely at all physical aspects. With thorough inquiry, the agent will be able to conclude whether it's the same person or not. Let's see it happen in Java terms.</p>

<p>Here's the source code of String's <code>equals()</code> method:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6MYZy.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>It compares the Strings character by character, in order to come to a conclusion that they are indeed equal.</p>

<p><strong>That's how the String <code>equals</code> method behaves.</strong> So <code>datos[0].equals(usuario)</code> will return true, because it performs a <em>logical comparison</em>.</p>

<p>It's good to notice that <strong>in some cases use of "==" operator can lead to the expected result, because the way how java handles strings</strong> - string literals are interned  (see <code>String.intern()</code>) during compilation - so when you write for example <code>"hello world"</code> in two classes and compare those strings with "==" you could get result: true, which is expected according to <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.10.5" rel="noreferrer">specification</a>; when you compare same strings (if they have same value) when the first one is string literal (ie. defined through <code>"i am string literal"</code>) and second is constructed during runtime ie. with "new" keyword like <code>new String("i am string literal")</code>, the <code>==</code> (equality) operator returns false, because both of them are different instances of the <code>String</code> class. </p>

<p><strong>Only right way is using <code>.equals()</code> -&gt; <code>datos[0].equals(usuario)</code>.</strong> <code>==</code> says only if two objects are the same instance of object (ie. have same memory address)</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: 01.04.2013 I updated this post due comments below which are somehow right. Originally I declared that interning (String.intern) is side effect of JVM optimization. Although it certainly save memory resources (which was what i meant by "optimization") it is mainly feature of language</p>

<p><code>equals()</code> function is a method of <code>Object</code> class which should be overridden by programmer. <code>String</code> class overrides it to check if two strings are equal i.e. in content and not reference. </p>

<p><code>==</code> operator checks if the references of both the objects are the same. </p>

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(abc == xyz)
     System.out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"Refers to same string"</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>Here the <code>abc</code> and <code>xyz</code>, both refer to same <code>String</code> <code>"Awesome"</code>. Hence the expression <code>(abc == xyz)</code> is <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>Here <code>abc</code> and <code>xyz</code> are two different strings with the same content <code>"Hello World"</code>. Hence here the expression <code>(abc == xyz)</code> is <code>false</code> where as <code>(abc.equals(xyz))</code> is <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>Hope you understood the difference between <code>==</code> and <code>&lt;Object&gt;.equals()</code> </p>

}
</code></pre>

<p>When the first line of code <code>String str1 = "Hello world."</code> executes, a string <code>\Hello world."</code>
is created, and the variable <code>str1</code> refers to it. Another string <code>"Hello world."</code> will not be created again when the next line of code executes because of optimization. The variable <code>str2</code> also refers to the existing <code>""Hello world."</code>.</p>

<p>The operator <code>==</code> checks identity of two objects (whether two variables refer to same object). Since <code>str1</code> and <code>str2</code> refer to same string in memory, they are identical to each other. The method <code>equals</code> checks equality of two objects (whether two objects have same content). Of course, the content of <code>str1</code> and <code>str2</code> are same.</p>

<p>When code <code>String str3 = new String("Hello world.")</code> executes, a new instance of string with content <code>"Hello world."</code> is created, and it is referred to by the variable <code>str3</code>. And then another instance of string with content <code>"Hello world."</code> is created again, and referred to by
<code>str4</code>. Since <code>str3</code> and <code>str4</code> refer to two different instances, they are not identical, but their
content are same.</p>

<p>Therefore, the output contains four lines:</p>

<p>I know this is an old question but here's how I look at it (I find very useful):</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Technical explanations</strong></p>

<p>In Java, all variables are either <strong>primitive types</strong> or <strong>references</strong>.</p>

<p>(If you need to know what a reference is: "Object variables" are just <em>pointers to objects.</em> So with <code>Object something = ...</code>, something is really an address in memory (a number).)</p>

<p><code>==</code> compares the exact values. So it compares if the primitive values are the same, or if the references (addresses) are the same. That's why <code>==</code> often doesn't work on Strings; Strings are objects, and doing <code>==</code> on two string variables just compares if the address is same in memory, as others have pointed out. <code>.equals()</code> calls the comparison method of objects, which will compare the actual objects pointed by the references. In the case of Strings, it compares each character to see if they're equal.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>The interesting part</strong>:</p>

<p>So why does <code>==</code> sometimes return true for Strings? Note that Strings are immutable. In your code, if you do</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">foo</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">"hi"</span>;
<span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">bar</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">"hi"</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>Since strings are immutable (when you call <code>.trim()</code> or something, it produces a new string, not modifying the original object pointed to in memory), you don't really need two different <code>String("hi")</code> objects. If the compiler is smart, the bytecode will read to only generate one <code>String("hi")</code> object. So if you do </p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (foo == bar) ...
</code></pre>

<p>right after, they're pointing to the same object, and will return true. But you rarely intend this. Instead, you're asking for user input, which is creating new strings at different parts of memory, etc. etc.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you do something like <code>baz = new String(bar)</code> the compiler may still figure out they're the same thing. But the main point is when the compiler sees literal strings, it can easily optimize same strings.</p>

<p>I don't know how it works in runtime, but I assume the JVM doesn't keep a list of "live strings" and check if a same string exists. (eg if you read a line of input twice, and the user enters the same input twice, it won't check if the second input string is the same as the first, and point them to the same memory). It'd save a bit of heap memory, but it's so negligible the overhead isn't worth it. Again, the point is it's easy for the compiler to optimize literal strings.</p>

<p>There you have it... a gritty explanation for <code>==</code> vs. <code>.equals()</code> and why it seems random.</p>

<p>@Melkhiah66 You can use equals method instead of '==' method to check the equality.
If you use intern() then it checks whether the object is in pool if present then returns
equal else unequal. equals method internally uses hashcode and gets you the required result.

<p>Someone said on a post higher up that  == is used for int and for checking nulls.
It may also be used to check for Boolean operations and char types.</p>

<p>Be very careful though and double check that you are using a char and not a String.

<p><code>a==b</code></p>

<p>Compares references, not values. The use of <code>==</code> with object references is generally limited to the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Comparing to see if a reference is <code>null</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Comparing two enum values. This works because there is only one object for each <code>enum</code> constant.</p></li>
<li><p>You want to know if two references are to the same object</p></li>
</ol>

<p><code>"a".equals("b")</code></p>

<p>Compares values for equality. Because this method is defined in the <code>Object</code> class, from which all other classes are derived, it's automatically defined for every class. However, it doesn't perform an intelligent comparison for most classes unless the class overrides it. It has been defined in a meaningful way for most Java core classes. If it's not defined for a (user) class, it behaves the same as <code>==</code>.</p>
