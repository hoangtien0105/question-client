It looks like this:

int option;
option = input.nextInt(); // Read numerical value from input
System.out.println(&quot;Enter 1st string&quot;);

The problem is that after entering the numerical value, the first input.nextLine() is skipped and the second input.nextLine() is executed, so that my output looks like this:

I think a more readable/idiomatic solution would be to call scanner.skip(&quot;[\\r\\n]+&quot;) to drop any newline characters after calling nextInt().\n\nEDIT: as @PatrickParker noted below, this will cause an infinite loop if user inputs any whitespace after the number.

To do so, the user is required to press &quot;enter&quot;/&quot;return&quot; key on the keyboard.\n\n\nWhat is important is that this key beside ensuring placing user data to standard input (represented by System.in which is read by Scanner) also sends OS dependant line separators (like for Windows \\r\\n) after it.\nSo when you are asking the user for value like age, and user types 42 and presses enter, standard input will contain &quot;42\\r\\n&quot;.\nProblem\nScanner#nextInt (and other Scanner#nextType methods) doesn&apos;t allow Scanner to consume these line separators. It will read them from System.in (how else Scanner would know that there are no more digits from the user which represent age value than facing whitespace?) which will remove them from standard input, but it will also cache those line separators internally. What we need to remember, is that all of the Scanner methods are always scanning starting from the cached text.\nNow Scanner#nextLine() simply collects and returns all characters until it finds line separators (or end of stream). But since line separators after reading the number from the console are found immediately in Scanner&apos;s cache, it returns empty String, meaning that Scanner was not able to find any character before those line separators (or end of stream).\nBTW nextLine also consumes those line separators.\nSolution\nSo when you want to ask for number and then for entire line while avoiding that empty string as result of nextLine, either\n\nconsume line separator left by nextInt from Scanners cache by\ncalling nextLine,\nor IMO more readable way would be by calling skip(&quot;\\\\R&quot;) or skip(&quot;\\r\\n|\\r|\\n&quot;) to let Scanner skip part matched by line separator (more info about \\R: https://stackoverflow.com/a/31060125)\ndon&apos;t use nextInt (nor next, or any nextTYPE methods) at all. Instead read entire data line-by-line using nextLine and parse numbers from each line (assuming one line contains only one number) to proper type like int via Integer.parseInt.\n\n\nBTW: Scanner#nextType methods can skip delimiters (by default all whitespaces like tabs, line separators) including those cached by scanner, until they will find next non-delimiter value (token).

The reason why your code didn&apos;t work was because there was nothing else to store from your input (where you inputted the int) into string1. I&apos;ll just shed a little more light to the entire topic.\n\nConsider nextLine() as the odd one out among the nextFoo() methods in the Scanner class. Let&apos;s take a quick example.. Let&apos;s say we have two lines of code like the ones below:\n\nint firstNumber = input.nextInt();\nint secondNumber = input.nextInt();\n\n\nIf we input the value below (as a single line of input)\n\n\n  54 234\n\n\nThe value of our firstNumber and secondNumber variable become 54 and 234 respectively.

It simply takes the &quot;next int&quot; and moves on. This is the same for the rest of the nextFoo() methods except nextLine().\n\nnextLine() generates a new line feed immediately after taking a value; this is what @RohitJain means by saying the new line feed is &quot;consumed&quot;.\n\nLastly, the next() method simply takes the nearest String without generating a new line; this makes this the preferential method for taking separate Strings within the same single line.\n\nI hope this helps..

<p>I am using the <code>Scanner</code> methods <code>nextInt()</code> and <code>nextLine()</code> for reading input. </p>

<p>It looks like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">System.out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"Enter numerical value"</span>);    
<span class="hljs-type">int</span> option;
option = input.nextInt(); <span class="hljs-comment">// Read numerical value from input</span>
System.out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"Enter 1st string"</span>); 
<span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">string1</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> input.nextLine(); <span class="hljs-comment">// Read 1st string (this is skipped)</span>
System.out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"Enter 2nd string"</span>);
<span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">string2</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> input.nextLine(); <span class="hljs-comment">// Read 2nd string (this appears right after reading numerical value)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that after entering the numerical value, the first <code>input.nextLine()</code> is skipped and the second <code>input.nextLine()</code> is executed, so that my output looks like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">Enter numerical value
<span class="hljs-number">3</span>   <span class="hljs-comment">// This is my input</span>
Enter 1st string    <span class="hljs-comment">// The program is supposed to stop here and wait for my input, but is skipped</span>
Enter 2nd string    <span class="hljs-comment">// ...and this line is executed and waits for my input</span>
</code></pre>

<p>I tested my application and it looks like the problem lies in using <code>input.nextInt()</code>. If I delete it, then both <code>string1 = input.nextLine()</code> and <code>string2 = input.nextLine()</code> are executed as I want them to be.</p>

<p>That's because the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html#nextInt%28%29" rel="noreferrer"><code>Scanner.nextInt</code></a> method does not read the <em>newline</em> character in your input created by hitting "Enter," and so the call to <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html#nextLine%28%29" rel="noreferrer"><code>Scanner.nextLine</code></a> returns after reading that <em>newline</em>.</p>

<p>You will encounter the similar behaviour when you use <code>Scanner.nextLine</code> after <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html#next%28%29" rel="noreferrer"><code>Scanner.next()</code></a> or any <code>Scanner.nextFoo</code> method (except <code>nextLine</code> itself).</p>

<p><strong>Workaround:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Either put a <code>Scanner.nextLine</code> call after each <code>Scanner.nextInt</code> or <code>Scanner.nextFoo</code> to consume rest of that line including <em>newline</em> </p>

<span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">str1</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> input.nextLine();
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Or, even better, read the input through <code>Scanner.nextLine</code> and convert your input to the proper format you need. For example, you may convert to an integer using <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#parseInt(java.lang.String)" rel="noreferrer"><code>Integer.parseInt(String)</code></a> method.</p>

<p>The problem is with the <strong>input.nextInt()</strong> method - it only reads the int value. So when you continue reading with input.nextLine() you receive the "\n" Enter key. So to skip this you have to add the <strong>input.nextLine()</strong>. Hope this should be clear now.</p>

<p>Try it like that:</p>

<p>There seem to be many questions about this issue with <code>java.util.Scanner</code>. I think a more readable/idiomatic solution would be to call <code>scanner.skip("[\r\n]+")</code> to drop any newline characters after calling <code>nextInt()</code>.</p>

<p>EDIT: as @PatrickParker noted below, this will cause an infinite loop if user inputs any whitespace after the number. See their answer for a better pattern to use with skip: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/42471816/143585">https://stackoverflow.com/a/42471816/143585</a></p>

<p>It does that because <code>input.nextInt();</code> doesn't capture the newline. you could do like the others proposed by adding an <code>input.nextLine();</code> underneath.<br>
Alternatively you can do it C# style and parse a nextLine to an integer like so:  </p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">number</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> Integer.parseInt(input.nextLine());

<p>TL;DR<br>
Use <code>scanner.skip("\\R?")</code> before <code>scanner.nextLine()</code> if you are not sure if previous instruction was <code>scanner.next()</code> or <code>scanner.next*TypeName*()</code>.</p>
<p><code>skip</code> uses regex where</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>\R</code> represents line separators</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>?</code> will make <code>\R</code> line separator sequence optional - which will prevent <code>skip</code> method from</p>
<p>(a) waiting for matching sequence - in case of reaching end of still opened source of data like <code>System.in</code><br>
(b) throwing <code>java.util.NoSuchElementException</code> in case of terminated/closed source of data, or when actual data doesn't match what we want to skip.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Things you need to know:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>text which represents few lines also contains non-printable characters between lines (we call them line separators) like</p>
</li>
<li><p>carriage return (CR - in String literals represented as <code>"\r"</code>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>line feed (LF - in String literals represented as <code>"\n"</code>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>when you are reading data from the console, it allows the user to type his response and when he is done he needs to <em>somehow</em> confirm that fact. To do so, the user is required to press "enter"/"return" key on the keyboard.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What is important is that this key beside ensuring placing user data to <em>standard input</em> (represented by <code>System.in</code> which is read by <code>Scanner</code>) also sends OS dependant line separators (like for Windows <code>\r\n</code>) after it.</p>
<p>So when you are asking the user for value like <code>age</code>, and user types 42 and presses enter, standard input will contain <code>"42\r\n"</code>.</p>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p><code>Scanner#nextInt</code> (and other <code>Scanner#next<b><i>Type</i></b></code> methods) doesn't allow Scanner to <em>consume</em> these line separators. It will read them from <code>System.in</code> (how else Scanner would know that there are no more digits from the user which represent <code>age</code> value than facing whitespace?) which will remove them from standard input, but <strong>it will also <em>cache</em> those line separators internally</strong>. What we need to remember, is that all of the Scanner methods are always scanning starting from the cached text.</p>
<p>Now <code>Scanner#nextLine()</code> simply collects and returns all characters <em>until it finds line separators</em> (or end of stream). But since line separators after reading the number from the console are found immediately in Scanner's cache, it returns empty String, meaning that Scanner was not able to find any character before those line separators (or end of stream).<br>
BTW <code>nextLine</code> also <em>consumes</em> those line separators.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>So when you want to ask for number and then for entire line while avoiding that empty string as result of <code>nextLine</code>, either</p>
<ul>
<li>consume line separator left by <code>nextInt</code> from Scanners cache by</li>
<li>calling <code>nextLine</code>,</li>
<li>or IMO <em><strong>more readable</strong></em> way would be by calling <code>skip("\\R")</code> or <code>skip("\r\n|\r|\n")</code> to let Scanner skip part matched by line separator (more info about <code>\R</code>: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/31060125">https://stackoverflow.com/a/31060125</a>)</li>
<li>don't use <code>nextInt</code> (nor <code>next</code>, or any <code>nextTYPE</code> methods) at all. Instead read entire data line-by-line using <code>nextLine</code> and parse numbers from each line (assuming one line contains only one number) to proper type like <code>int</code> via <code>Integer.parseInt</code>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>BTW</strong>: <code>Scanner#next<b><i>Type</i></b></code> methods can <em>skip</em> delimiters (by default all whitespaces like tabs, line separators) including those cached by scanner, until they will find next non-delimiter value (token). Thanks to that for input like <code>"42\r\n\r\n321\r\n\r\n\r\nfoobar"</code> code</p>

<p>I guess I'm pretty late to the party.. </p>

<p>As previously stated, calling <code>input.nextLine()</code> after getting your int value will solve your problem. The reason why your code didn't work was because there was nothing else to store from your input (where you inputted the int) into <code>string1</code>. I'll just shed a little more light to the entire topic.</p>

<p>Consider <em>nextLine()</em> as the odd one out among the <em>nextFoo()</em> methods in the Scanner class. Let's take a quick example.. Let's say we have two lines of code like the ones below:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">firstNumber</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> input.nextInt();
<span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">secondNumber</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> input.nextInt();
</code></pre>

<p>If we input the value below (as a single line of input)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>54 234</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The value of our <code>firstNumber</code> and <code>secondNumber</code> variable become 54 and 234 respectively. The reason why this works this way is because a new line feed (<em>i.e \n</em>)  <strong><em>IS NOT</em></strong> automatically generated when the nextInt() method takes in the values. It simply takes the <em>"next int"</em> and moves on. This is the same for the rest of the nextFoo() methods except nextLine().</p>

<p>nextLine() generates a new line feed immediately after taking a value; this is what @RohitJain means by saying the new line feed is "consumed".</p>

<p>Lastly, the next() method simply takes the nearest String <strong>without</strong> generating a new line; this makes this the preferential method for taking separate Strings within the same single line.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.. Merry coding!</p>

<p>The problem is with the input.nextInt() method - it only reads the int value. So when you continue reading with input.nextLine() you receive the "\n" Enter key. So to skip this you have to add the input.nextLine(). Hope this should be clear now.</p>
<p>Try it like that:</p>

<p>This is a very basic problem for beginner coders in java. The same problem I also have faced when I started java (Self Taught).
Actually, when we take an input of integer dataType, it reads only integer value and leaves the newLine(\n) character and this line(i.e. leaved new line by integer dynamic input )creates the problem when we try to take a new input.
eg. Like if we take the integer input and then after try to take an String input.</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">value1=sc.nextInt();
value2=sc.nextLine();
</code></pre>
<p>the value2 will auto read the newLine character and will not take the user input.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>:
just we need to add one line of code before taking the next user input i.e.</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">sc.nextLine();
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">value1=sc.nextInt();
sc.nextLine();
value2=sc.nextLine();
</code></pre>
<p>Note: don't forget to close the Scanner to prevent memory leak;</p>

The reason why this works this way is because a new line feed (\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;i.e \\n\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;)  \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;IS NOT\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; automatically generated when the nextInt() method takes in the values. It simply takes the \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;\u0026quot;next int\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; and moves on. This is the same for the rest of the nextFoo() methods except nextLine().\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;nextLine() generates a new line feed immediately after taking a value; this is what @RohitJain means by saying the new line feed is \u0026quot;consumed\u0026quot;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Lastly, the next() method simply takes the nearest String \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;without\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; generating a new line; this makes this the preferential method for taking separate Strings within the same single line.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I hope this helps..
