See this related answer:\n\n(Is there a reason JavaScript developers don&apos;t use Array.push()?) \n\nAfter looking at these (opposing) test runs, it looks like .push() is fine for string arrays which will not likely grow over 100 items - I will avoid it in favor of indexed adds for larger arrays.\n

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>ECMAScript 6 (ES6) introduces a new type of literal, namely <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/template_strings" rel="noreferrer"><strong>template literals</strong></a>. They have many features, variable interpolation among others, but most importantly for this question, they can be multiline.</p>

<p>A template literal is delimited by <em>backticks</em>:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> html = <span class="hljs-string">`
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;Some HTML here&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
`</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>(Note: I'm not advocating to use HTML in strings)</p>

<p><a href="https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#test-template_literals" rel="noreferrer">Browser support is OK</a>, but you can use <a href="https://babeljs.io/" rel="noreferrer">transpilers</a> to be more compatible.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Original ES5 answer:</h3>

<p>Javascript doesn't have a here-document syntax. You can escape the literal newline, however, which comes close:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-string">"foo \
bar"</span>
</code></pre>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution2" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl solution-inner border md:px-10 md:py-10 px-2 py-10 shadow-md bg-white"><div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-between"><h4 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 2</h4><div class="tags-wrap h-max space-x-8"><div class="tags"><a class="rounded-2xl border bg-neutral-100 px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold whitespace-nowrap" href="/questions/tag/heredoc">heredoc</a></div></div></div><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<h2>ES6 Update:</h2>

<p>As the first answer mentions, with ES6/Babel, you can now create multi-line strings simply by using backticks:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> htmlString = <span class="hljs-string">`Say hello to 
multi-line
strings!`</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>Interpolating variables is a popular new feature that comes with back-tick delimited strings:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> htmlString = <span class="hljs-string">`<span class="hljs-subst">${user.name}</span> liked your post about strings`</span>;

<h2>Original ES5 answer:</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml?showone=Multiline_string_literals#Multiline_string_literals" rel="noreferrer">Google's JavaScript style guide</a> recommends to use string concatenation instead of escaping newlines:</p>
  
  <p><strong>Do not do this:</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myString = <span class="hljs-string">'A rather long string of English text, an error message \

  <p>The whitespace at the beginning of each line can't be safely stripped at compile time; whitespace after the slash will result in tricky errors; and while most script engines support this, it is not part of ECMAScript.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Use string concatenation instead:</strong></p>

<p>the pattern <code>text = &lt;&lt;"HERE" This Is A Multiline String HERE</code> is not available in js (I remember using it much in my good old Perl days).</p>

<p>To keep oversight with complex or long multiline strings I sometimes use an array pattern:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myString = 
   [<span class="hljs-string">'&lt;div id="someId"&gt;'</span>,

    <span class="hljs-string">'&lt;a href="#someRef"&gt;someRefTxt&lt;/a&gt;'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-string">'&lt;/div&gt;'</span>
   ].<span class="hljs-title function_">join</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'\n'</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>or the pattern anonymous already showed (escape newline), which can be an ugly block in your code:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myString = 
       <span class="hljs-string">'&lt;div id="someId"&gt; \
some content&lt;br /&gt; \
&lt;a href="#someRef"&gt;someRefTxt&lt;/a&gt; \
&lt;/div&gt;'</span>;

<p>You <em>can</em> have multiline strings in pure JavaScript.</p>
<p>This method is based on the serialization of functions, which is <a href="http://es5.github.io/#x15.3.4.2" rel="noreferrer">defined to be implementation-dependent</a>. It does work in the most browsers (see below), but there's no guarantee that it will still work in the future, so do not rely on it.</p>

<p>The method has successfully been tested in the following browsers (not mentioned = not tested):</p>
<ul>
<li>IE 4 - 10</li>
<li>Opera 9.50 - 12 (not in 9-)</li>
<li>Safari 4 - 6 (not in 3-)</li>

<p>Be careful with your minifier, though. It tends to remove comments. For the <a href="http://www.julienlecomte.net/yuicompressor/README" rel="noreferrer">YUI compressor</a>, a comment starting with <code>/*!</code> (like the one I used) will be preserved.</p>
<p>I think a <em>real</em> solution would be to use <a href="http://coffeescript.org/#strings" rel="noreferrer">CoffeeScript</a>.</p>
<p>ES6 UPDATE: You could use backtick instead of creating a function with a comment and running toString on the comment. The regex would need to be updated to only strip spaces. You could also have a string prototype method for doing this:</p>

<p>I came up with this very jimmy rigged method of a multi lined string. Since converting a function into a string also returns any comments inside the function you can use the comments as your string using a multilined comment /**/. You just have to trim off the ends and you have your string.</p>

<p>I solved this by outputting a div, making it hidden, and calling the div id by jQuery when I needed it.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;div id=<span class="hljs-string">"UniqueID"</span> style=<span class="hljs-string">"display:none;"</span>&gt;
     <span class="hljs-title class_">Strings</span>
     <span class="hljs-title class_">On</span>
     <span class="hljs-title class_">Multiple</span>
     <span class="hljs-title class_">Lines</span>
     <span class="hljs-title class_">Here</span>
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then when I need to get the string, I just use the following jQuery:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$(<span class="hljs-string">'#UniqueID'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">html</span>();
</code></pre>

<p>Which returns my text on multiple lines. If I call </p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">alert</span>($(<span class="hljs-string">'#UniqueID'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">html</span>());
</code></pre>

<p>I get:</p>

<p>There are multiple ways to achieve this</p>

<p><strong>1. Slash concatenation</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">MultiLine</span>=  <span class="hljs-string">'1\

    3\
    4\
    5\
    6\
    7\
    8\
    9'</span>;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2. regular concatenation</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">MultiLine</span> = <span class="hljs-string">'1'</span>
+<span class="hljs-string">'2'</span>
+<span class="hljs-string">'3'</span>
+<span class="hljs-string">'4'</span>
+<span class="hljs-string">'5'</span>;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>3. Array Join concatenation</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">MultiLine</span> = [
<span class="hljs-string">'1'</span>,
<span class="hljs-string">'2'</span>,
<span class="hljs-string">'3'</span>,
<span class="hljs-string">'4'</span>,
<span class="hljs-string">'5'</span>
].<span class="hljs-title function_">join</span>(<span class="hljs-string">''</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>Performance wise, <strong>Slash concatenation</strong> (first one) is the fastest.</p>

<p><strong>Refer</strong> <a href="http://jsperf.com/zp-string-concatenation/6">this test case</a> for more details regarding the performance </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>With the <strong>ES2015</strong>, we can take advantage of its Template strings feature. With it, we just need to use back-ticks for creating multi line strings</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"> <span class="hljs-string">`&lt;h1&gt;{{title}}&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;{{hero.name}} details!&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;label&gt;id: &lt;/label&gt;{{hero.id}}&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;label&gt;name: &lt;/label&gt;{{hero.name}}&lt;/div&gt;

<p>Found a lot of over engineered answers here.
The two best answers in my opinion were:</p>
<p>1:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"> <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> str = <span class="hljs-string">`Multiline string.
            foo.
            bar.`</span>
</code></pre>
<p>which eventually logs:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title class_">Multiline</span> string.
           foo.
           bar.  
</code></pre>
<p>2:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> str = <span class="hljs-string">`Multiline string.
foo.
bar.`</span>
</code></pre>
<p>That logs it correctly but it's ugly in the script file if str is nested inside functions / objects etc...:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title class_">Multiline</span> string.
foo.
bar.
</code></pre>
<p>My really simple answer with regex which logs the str correctly:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> str = <span class="hljs-string">`Multiline string.
           foo.
           bar.`</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-regexp">/\n +/g</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'\n'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that it is not the perfect solution but it works if you are sure that after the new line (\n) at least one space will come (+ means at least one occurrence). It also will work with * (zero or more).</p>
<p>You can be more explicit and use {n,} which means at least n occurrences.</p>

<p>to sum up, I have tried 2 approaches listed here in user javascript programming (Opera 11.01):</p>

<ul>
<li>this one didn't work: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/805107/multiline-strings-in-javascript/805111#805111">Creating multiline strings in JavaScript</a></li>
<li>this worked fairly well, I have also figured out how to make it look good in Notepad++ source view: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/805107/multiline-strings-in-javascript/5571069#5571069">Creating multiline strings in JavaScript</a></li>
</ul>

<p>So I recommend the working approach for Opera user JS users. Unlike what the author was saying: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It doesn't work on firefox or opera; only on IE, chrome and safari. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It DOES work in Opera 11. At least in user JS scripts. Too bad I can't comment on individual answers or upvote the answer, I'd do it immediately. If possible, someone with higher privileges please do it for me.</p>

<p><strong>Updated for 2015</strong>: it's six years later now:  most people use a module loader, and the main module systems each have ways of loading templates. It's not inline, but the most common type of multiline string are templates, and <strong>templates should generally be kept out of JS anyway</strong>.</p>

<h2>require.js: 'require text'.</h2>

<p>Using <a href="https://github.com/requirejs/text" rel="noreferrer">require.js 'text' plugin</a>, with a multiline template in <strong>template.html</strong></p>

</code></pre>

<h2>NPM/browserify: the 'brfs' module</h2>

<p>Browserify <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/brfs" rel="noreferrer">uses a 'brfs' module</a> to load text files. This will actually build your template into your bundled HTML.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> fs = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"fs"</span>);

<p>You can use <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground" rel="noreferrer">TypeScript</a> (JavaScript SuperSet), it supports multiline strings, and transpiles back down to pure JavaScript without overhead:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> templates = {
    <span class="hljs-attr">myString</span>: <span class="hljs-string">`this is
a multiline
string`</span> 
}

<span class="hljs-title function_">alert</span>(templates.<span class="hljs-property">myString</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>If you'd want to accomplish the same with plain JavaScript:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> templates = 
{
 <span class="hljs-attr">myString</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){<span class="hljs-comment">/*
    This is some
    awesome multi-lined
    string using a comment 
    inside a function 
    returned as a string.
    Enjoy the jimmy rigged code.
*/</span>}.<span class="hljs-title function_">toString</span>().<span class="hljs-title function_">slice</span>(<span class="hljs-number">14</span>,-<span class="hljs-number">3</span>)

}
<span class="hljs-title function_">alert</span>(templates.<span class="hljs-property">myString</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the iPad/Safari does not support <code>'functionName.toString()'</code></p>

<p>If you have a lot of legacy code, you can also use the plain JavaScript variant in TypeScript (for cleanup purposes):</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">interface externTemplates
{
    <span class="hljs-attr">myString</span>:string;
}

declare <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-attr">templates</span>:externTemplates;

<span class="hljs-title function_">alert</span>(templates.<span class="hljs-property">myString</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>and you can use the multiline-string object from the plain JavaScript variant, where you put the templates into another file (which you can merge in the bundle).</p>

<p>Easiest way to make multiline strings in Javascrips is with the use of backticks ( `` ). This allows you to create multiline strings in which you can insert variables with <code>${variableName}</code>.</p>

<h2>Example:</h2>

<p></p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">
<div class="snippet-code">

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> age = <span class="hljs-number">26</span>;

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> multilineString = <span class="hljs-string">`
my name is: <span class="hljs-subst">${name}</span>

my age is: <span class="hljs-subst">${age}</span>
`</span>;

<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(multilineString);</code></pre>

<p>ES6 allows you to use a backtick to specify a string on multiple lines.  It's called a Template Literal.  Like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> multilineString = <span class="hljs-string">`One line of text
    second line of text
    third line of text
    fourth line of text`</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>Using the backtick works in NodeJS, and it's supported by Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera.</p>

<p>This has worked well for me, especially as I often insert values into the html constructed this way. But it has lots of limitations. Indentation would be nice. Not having to deal with nested quotation marks would be really nice, and just the bulkyness of it bothers me.</p>

<p>Is the .push() to add to the array taking up a lot of time? See this related answer:</p>

<p>(<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15649899/is-there-a-reason-javascript-developers-dont-use-array-push">Is there a reason JavaScript developers don't use Array.push()?</a>) </p>

<p>After looking at these (opposing) test runs, it looks like .push() is fine for string arrays which will not likely grow over 100 items - I will avoid it in favor of indexed adds for larger arrays.</p>
