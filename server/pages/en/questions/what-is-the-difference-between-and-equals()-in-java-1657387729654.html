<p>In general, the answer to  your question is "yes", but...</p>

<ul>
<li><code>.equals(...)</code> will only compare what it is written to compare, no more, no less.</li>
<li>If a class does not override the equals method, then it defaults to the <code>equals(Object o)</code> method of the closest parent class that has overridden this method. </li>
<li>If no parent classes have provided an override, then it defaults to the method from the ultimate parent class, Object, and so you're left with the <code>Object#equals(Object o)</code> method. Per the Object API this is the same as <code>==</code>; that is, it returns true <em>if and only if</em> both variables refer to the same object, if their references are one and the same. Thus you will be testing  for <strong>object equality</strong> and not <strong>functional equality</strong>.</li>
<li>Always remember to override <code>hashCode</code> if you override <code>equals</code> so as not to "break the contract". As per the API, the result returned from the <code>hashCode()</code> method for two objects <strong>must</strong> be the same if their <code>equals</code> methods show that they are equivalent. The converse is <em>not</em> necessarily true. </li>
</ul>

<p>With respect to the String class:</p>

<p>The equals() <strong>method</strong> compares the "value" inside String instances (on the heap) irrespective if the two object references refer to the same String instance or not. If any two object references of type String refer to the same String instance then great! If the two object references refer to two different String instances .. it doesn't make a difference. Its the "value" (that is: the contents of the character array) inside each String instance that is being compared.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the "==" <strong>operator</strong> compares the value of <strong>two object references</strong> to see whether they refer to the same <strong>String instance</strong>. If the value of both object references "refer to" the same String instance then the result of the boolean expression would be "true"..duh. If, on the other hand, the value of both object references "refer to" <strong>different String instances</strong> (even though both String instances have identical "values", that is, the contents of the character arrays of each String instance are the same) the result of the boolean expression would be "false".</p>

<p>The difference between == and equals confused me for sometime until I decided to have a closer look at it.
Many of them say that for comparing string you should use <code>equals</code> and not <code>==</code>. Hope in this answer I will be able to say the difference.</p>

<p>The best way to answer this question will be by asking a few questions to yourself. so let's start:</p>

<p><strong>What is the output for the below program:</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">mango</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">"mango"</span>;
<span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">mango2</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">"mango"</span>;
System.out.println(mango != mango2);
System.out.println(mango == mango2);
</code></pre>

<p>if you say, </p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-literal">false</span>
<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
</code></pre>

<p>I will say you are <em>right</em> but <strong>why did you say that</strong>?
and If you say the output is,</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
<span class="hljs-literal">false</span>
</code></pre>

<p>I will say you are <em>wrong</em> but I will still ask you, why you think that is right?</p>

<p>Ok, Let's try to answer this one:</p>

<p><strong>What is the output for the below program:</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">mango</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">"mango"</span>;
<span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">mango3</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"mango"</span>);
System.out.println(mango != mango3);
System.out.println(mango == mango3);
</code></pre>

<p>Now If you say,</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-literal">false</span>
<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
</code></pre>

<p>I will say you are <em>wrong</em> but <strong>why is it wrong now</strong>?
the correct output for this program is</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
<span class="hljs-literal">false</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Please compare the above program and try to think about it.</p>

<p>Ok. Now this might help (please read this : <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18396927/how-to-print-the-address-of-an-object-if-you-have-redefined-tostring-method">print the address of object</a> - not possible but still we can use it.)</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">mango</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">"mango"</span>;
<span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">mango2</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">"mango"</span>;
<span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">mango3</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"mango"</span>);
System.out.println(mango != mango2);
System.out.println(mango == mango2);
System.out.println(mango3 != mango2);
System.out.println(mango3 == mango2);
<span class="hljs-comment">// mango2 = "mang";</span>
System.out.println(mango+<span class="hljs-string">" "</span>+ mango2);
System.out.println(mango != mango2);
System.out.println(mango == mango2);

System.out.println(System.identityHashCode(mango));
System.out.println(System.identityHashCode(mango2));
System.out.println(System.identityHashCode(mango3));
</code></pre>

<p>can you just try to think about the output of the last three lines in the code above:
for me ideone printed this out (<a href="https://ideone.com/JA6NgB" rel="noreferrer">you can check the code here</a>):</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-literal">false</span>
<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
<span class="hljs-literal">false</span>
mango mango
<span class="hljs-literal">false</span>
<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
<span class="hljs-number">17225372</span>
<span class="hljs-number">17225372</span>
<span class="hljs-number">5433634</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Oh! Now you see the <strong>identityHashCode(mango) is equal to identityHashCode(mango2) But it is not equal to identityHashCode(mango3)</strong></p>

<p>Even though all the string variables - mango, mango2 and mango3 - have the <strong>same</strong> value, which is "mango", <code>identityHashCode()</code> is still not the same for all.</p>

<p>Now try to uncomment this line <code>// mango2 = "mang";</code> and run it again this time you will see all three <code>identityHashCode()</code> are different.
Hmm that is a helpful hint</p>

<p>we know that if <code>hashcode(x)=N</code> and <code>hashcode(y)=N</code> =&gt; <code>x is equal to y</code></p>

<p>I am not sure how java works internally but I assume this is what happened when I said:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">mango = <span class="hljs-string">"mango"</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>java created a string <code>"mango"</code> which was pointed(referenced) by the variable <code>mango</code> something like this</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">mango ----&gt; <span class="hljs-string">"mango"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Now in the next line when I said:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">mango2 = <span class="hljs-string">"mango"</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>It actually reused the same string <code>"mango"</code> which looks something like this</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">mango ----&gt; <span class="hljs-string">"mango"</span> &lt;---- mango2
</code></pre>

<p>Both mango and mango2 pointing to the same reference
Now when I said </p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">mango3 = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"mango"</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>It actually created a completely new reference(string) for "mango". which looks something like this,</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">mango -----&gt; <span class="hljs-string">"mango"</span> &lt;------ mango2

mango3 ------&gt; <span class="hljs-string">"mango"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>and that's why when I put out the values for <code>mango == mango2</code>, it put out <code>true</code>. and when I put out the value for <code>mango3 == mango2</code>, it put out <code>false</code> (even when the values were the same).</p>

<p>and when you uncommented the line <code>// mango2 = "mang";</code>
It actually created a string "mang" which turned our graph like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">mango ----&gt;<span class="hljs-string">"mango"</span>
mango2 ----&gt; <span class="hljs-string">"mang"</span>
mango3 -----&gt; <span class="hljs-string">"mango"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This is why the identityHashCode is not the same for all.</p>

<p>Hope this helps you guys.
Actually, I wanted to generate a test case where == fails and equals() pass.
Please feel free to comment and let me know If I am wrong.</p>

<p>Just remember that <code>.equals(...)</code> has to be implemented by the class you are trying to compare. Otherwise, there isn't much of a point; the version of the method for the Object class does the same thing as the comparison operation: <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#equals%28java.lang.Object%29" rel="nofollow">Object#equals</a>.</p>

<p>The only time you really want to use the comparison operator for objects is wen you are comparing Enums. This is because there is only one instance of an Enum value at a time. For instance, given the enum</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">enum</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">FooEnum</span> {A, B, C}
</code></pre>

<p>You will never have more than one instance of <code>A</code> at a time, and the same for <code>B</code> and <code>C</code>. This means that you can actually write a method like so:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-type">boolean</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">compareFoos</span><span class="hljs-params">(FooEnum x, FooEnum y)</span>
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> (x == y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And you will have no problems whatsoever.</p>

<p>This string comparison could be used as a basis for comparing other types of object.</p>
<p>For instance if I have <strong>a Person class</strong>, I need to define the <strong>criteria base on which I will compare  two persons</strong>. Let's say this person class has <strong>instance variables of height and weight.</strong></p>
<p>So creating person objects <code>person1 and person2</code> and for comparing these two using the <code>.equals()</code> I need to override the <strong>equals method of the person class</strong> to define based on which instance variables(heigh or weight) the comparison will be.</p>
<p>However, the <code>== operator will still return results based on the memory location of the two objects(person1 and person2)</code>.</p>
<p>For ease of generalizing this person object comparison, I have created the following test class. <strong>Experimenting on these concepts will reveal tons of facts</strong>.</p>

<p>Example 2 -</p>
<p>But if we wants to compare objects content using equals method then class has to override object's class equals() method and provide implementation for content comparison. Here, String class has overrided equals method for content comparison. All wrapper classes have overrided equals method for content comparison.</p>

<p>In case of String, there is one more usecase. Here when we assign any string to  String reference then string constant is created inside <strong>String constant pool</strong>. If we assign same string to new String reference then no new string constant is created rather it will refer to existing string constant.</p>

<p>In short, the answer is "Yes".</p>

<p>It is the difference between <em>identity</em> and <em>equivalence</em>.</p>

<p><code>a == b</code> means that a and b are <em>identical</em>, that is, they are symbols for very same object in memory.</p>

<p><code>a.equals( b )</code> means that they are <em>equivalent</em>, that they are symbols for objects that in some sense have the same value -- although those objects may occupy different places in memory.</p>

<p>Note that with equivalence, the question of how to evaluate and compare objects comes into play -- complex objects may be regarded as equivalent for practical purposes even though some of their contents differ.  With identity, there is no such question.</p>

<p>Since Java doesnt support operator overloading, <code>==</code> behaves identical
for every object but <code>equals()</code> is method, which can be overridden in
Java and logic to compare objects can be changed based upon business
rules.</p>
<p>Main difference between <code>==</code> and equals in Java is that <code>"=="</code> is used to
compare primitives while <code>equals()</code> method is recommended to check
equality of objects.</p>
<p><strong>String comparison is a common scenario of using both <code>==</code> and <code>equals()</code> method.</strong> Since java.lang.String class override equals method, It
return true if two String object contains same content but <code>==</code> will
only return true if two references are pointing to same object.</p>
<p><strong>Here is an example</strong> of comparing two Strings in Java for equality using <code>==</code> and <code>equals()</code> method which will clear some doubts:</p>

<p>Basically, <code>==</code> compares if two objects have the same reference on the heap, so unless two references are linked to the same object, this comparison will be false.</p>

<p><code>equals()</code> is a method inherited from <strong><code>Object</code></strong> class. This method by default compares if two objects have the same referece. It means:</p>

<p><code>object1.equals(object2)</code> <strong>&lt;=&gt;</strong> <code>object1 == object2</code></p>

<p>However, if you want to establish equality between two objects of the same class you should override this method. It is also very important to override the method <code>hashCode()</code> if you have overriden <code>equals()</code>.</p>

<p>Implement <code>hashCode()</code> when establishing equality is part of the Java Object Contract. If you are working with collections, and you haven't implemented <code>hashCode()</code>, Strange Bad Things could happen:</p>

System.out.println(cats.get(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Cat</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"molly"</span>));
