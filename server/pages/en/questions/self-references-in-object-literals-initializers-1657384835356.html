The simplest way is to just do this:\n\nvar foo = {\n    a: 5,\n    b: 6\n};\nfoo.c = foo.a + foo.b;\n\n\nAll others are just more indirect ways to do the same thing. (Felix&apos;s is particularly clever, but requires creating and destroying a temporary function, adding complexity; and either leaves an extra property on the object or [if you delete that property] impacts the performance of subsequent property accesses on that object.)\n\nIf you need it to all be within one expression, you can do that without the temporary property:\n\nvar foo = function(o) {\n    o.c = o.a + o.b;\n    return o;\n}({a: 5, b: 6});\n\n\nOr of course, if you need to do this more than once:\n\nfunction buildFoo(a, b) {\n    var o = {a: a, b: b};\n    o.c = o.a + o.b;\n    return o;\n}\n\n\nthen where you need to use it:\n\nvar foo = buildFoo(5, 6);\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Simply instantiate an anonymous function:\n\nvar foo = new function () {\n    this.a = 5;\n    this.b = 6;\n    this.c = this.a + this.b;\n};\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Now in ES6 you can create lazy cached properties.

The difference is that this function returns an object that exposes the private variables and assigns that object to foo.  In the end, you return just the interface you want to expose as an object with the return {} statement.\n\nThe function is then executed at the end with the () which causes the entire foo object to be evaluated, all the variables within instantiated and the return object added as properties of foo().\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution6","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You could do it like this\n\nvar a, b\nvar foo = {\n    a: a = 5,\n    b: b = 6,\n    c: a + b\n}\n\n\nThat method has proven useful to me when I had to refer to the object that a function was originally declared on. The following is a minimal example of how I used it:\n\nfunction createMyObject() {\n    var count = 0, self\n    return {\n        a: self = {\n            log: function() {\n                console.log(count++)\n                return self\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nBy defining self as the object that contains the print function you allow the function to refer to that object. This means you will not have to &apos;bind&apos; the print function to an object if you need to pass it somewhere else. \n\nIf you would, instead, use this as illustrated below\n\nfunction createMyObject() {\n    var count = 0\n    return {\n        a: {\n            log: function() {\n                console.log(count++)\n                return this\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nThen the following code will log 0, 1, 2 and then give an error\n\nvar o = createMyObject()\nvar log = o.a.log\no.a.log().log() // this refers to the o.a object so the chaining works\nlog().log() // this refers to the window object so the chaining fails!\n\n\nBy using the self method you guarantee that print will always return the same object regardless of the context in which the function is ran. The code above will run just fine and log 0, 1, 2 and 3 when using the self version of createMyObject(). \n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution7","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"For completion, in ES6 we&apos;ve got classes (supported at the time of writing this only by latest browsers, but available in Babel, TypeScript and other transpilers)\n\nclass Foo {\n  constructor(){\n    this.a = 5;\n    this.b = 6;\n    this.c = this.a + this.b;\n  }  \n}\n\nconst foo = new Foo();\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution8","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"just for the sake of thought - place object&apos;s properties out of a timeline:\n\nvar foo = {\n    a: function(){return 5}(),\n    b: function(){return 6}(),\n    c: function(){return this.a + this.b}\n}\n\nconsole.log(foo.c())\n\n\nthere are better answers above too.

<p>In the current form, this code obviously throws a reference error since <code>this</code> doesn't refer to <code>foo</code>. But <em>is</em> there any way to have values in an object literal's properties depend on other properties declared earlier?</p>

<p>The obvious, simple answer is missing, so for completeness:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But <em>is</em> there any way to have values in an object literal's properties depend on other properties declared earlier?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. All of the solutions here defer it until after the object is created (in various ways) and then assign the third property. The <em>simplest</em> way is to just do this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> foo = {
    <span class="hljs-attr">a</span>: <span class="hljs-number">5</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attr">b</span>: <span class="hljs-number">6</span>
};
foo.<span class="hljs-property">c</span> = foo.<span class="hljs-property">a</span> + foo.<span class="hljs-property">b</span>;

<p>All others are just more indirect ways to do the same thing. (Felix's is particularly clever, but requires creating and destroying a temporary function, adding complexity; and either leaves an extra property on the object or [if you <code>delete</code> that property] <a href="http://jsperf.com/test-dictionary-mode">impacts the performance</a> of subsequent property accesses on that object.)</p>

<p>If you need it to all be within one expression, you can do that without the temporary property:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> foo = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">o</span>) {
    o.<span class="hljs-property">c</span> = o.<span class="hljs-property">a</span> + o.<span class="hljs-property">b</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> o;
}({<span class="hljs-attr">a</span>: <span class="hljs-number">5</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">b</span>: <span class="hljs-number">6</span>});
</code></pre>

<p>Or of course, if you need to do this more than once:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">buildFoo</span>(<span class="hljs-params">a, b</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> o = {<span class="hljs-attr">a</span>: a, <span class="hljs-attr">b</span>: b};
    o.<span class="hljs-property">c</span> = o.<span class="hljs-property">a</span> + o.<span class="hljs-property">b</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> o;
}
</code></pre>

<p>then where you need to use it:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> foo = <span class="hljs-title function_">buildFoo</span>(<span class="hljs-number">5</span>, <span class="hljs-number">6</span>);

<p>All the variables declared within <code>foo</code> are private to <code>foo</code>, as you would expect with any function declaration and because they are all in scope, they all have access to each other without needing to refer to <code>this</code>, just as you would expect with a function.  The difference is that this function returns an object that exposes the private variables and assigns that object to <code>foo</code>.  In the end, you return just the interface you want to expose as an object with the <code>return {}</code> statement.</p>

<p>The function is then executed at the end with the <code>()</code> which causes the entire foo object to be evaluated, all the variables within instantiated and the return object added as properties of <code>foo()</code>.</p>

<p>You could do it like this</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a, b
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> foo = {
    <span class="hljs-attr">a</span>: a = <span class="hljs-number">5</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attr">b</span>: b = <span class="hljs-number">6</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attr">c</span>: a + b
}
</code></pre>

<p>That method has proven useful to me when I had to refer to the object that a function was originally declared on. The following is a minimal example of how I used it:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">createMyObject</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> count = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, self
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> {
        <span class="hljs-attr">a</span>: self = {
            <span class="hljs-attr">log</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
                <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(count++)
                <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> self
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>By defining self as the object that contains the print function you allow the function to refer to that object. This means you will not have to 'bind' the print function to an object if you need to pass it somewhere else. </p>

<p>If you would, instead, use <code>this</code> as illustrated below</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">createMyObject</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> count = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> {
        <span class="hljs-attr">a</span>: {
            <span class="hljs-attr">log</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
                <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(count++)
                <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then the following code will log 0, 1, 2 and then give an error</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> o = <span class="hljs-title function_">createMyObject</span>()
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> log = o.<span class="hljs-property">a</span>.<span class="hljs-property">log</span>
o.<span class="hljs-property">a</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>().<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>() <span class="hljs-comment">// this refers to the o.a object so the chaining works</span>
<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>().<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>() <span class="hljs-comment">// this refers to the window object so the chaining fails!</span>
</code></pre>

<p>By using the self method you guarantee that print will always return the same object regardless of the context in which the function is ran. The code above will run just fine and log 0, 1, 2 and 3 when using the self version of <code>createMyObject()</code>. </p>

<ul>
<li>Sets the value at initialization (not a getter, or derived, etc)</li>
<li>Doesn't require any type of <code>init()</code> or code outside of the object literal</li>
<li>Is an object literal and not a factory function or other object creation mechanic.</li>

<p>The order is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/17438220/728393">guaranteed</a> (<code>bar</code> before <code>baz</code>).</p>

<p>It pollutes <code>window</code> of course, but I can't imagine someone writing a script that requires <code>window.temp</code> to be persistent. Maybe <code>tempMyApp</code> if you're paranoid.</p>

<p>It's also ugly but occasionally useful. An example is when you are using an API with rigid initialization conditions and don't feel like refactoring so the scoping is correct.</p>

<p>And it's dry, of course.</p>

<p>With that, you can use the object variable name to access the already assigned values.<br>

<h2>Two lazy solutions</h2>
<p>There are already excellent answers here and I'm no expert on this, but I am an expert in being lazy and to my expert eye these answers don't seem lazy enough.</p>
<h3>First: return object from anonymous function</h3>
<p>A very slight variation from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/10766107/4621141">T.J. Crowder</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/17421508/4621141">Henry Wrightson</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/14206385/4621141">Rafael Rocha</a> answers:</p>

  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> foo;

<p></p>
<p>The slight advantage here is just pasting your original object as it was, without worrying about arguments etc. (IMHO the wrapper function becomes quite transparent this way).</p>
<h3>Second: using setTimeout</h3>

<p>Ok I came up with another solution. Here I want to initialize an object representing the amount of milliseconds for each unit of time.
It turns out enum in typescript can not be used in my case, so I declared multiple variables that I assign to an object as follow:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-variable constant_">SECOND</span> = <span class="hljs-number">1000</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-variable constant_">MINUTE</span> = <span class="hljs-number">60</span> * <span class="hljs-variable constant_">SECOND</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-variable constant_">HOUR</span> = <span class="hljs-number">60</span> * <span class="hljs-variable constant_">MINUTE</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-variable constant_">DAY</span> = <span class="hljs-number">24</span> * <span class="hljs-variable constant_">HOUR</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-variable constant_">WEEK</span> = <span class="hljs-number">7</span> * <span class="hljs-variable constant_">DAY</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">TimeInMS</span> = {
  <span class="hljs-variable constant_">SECOND</span>,
  <span class="hljs-variable constant_">MINUTE</span>,
  <span class="hljs-variable constant_">HOUR</span>,
  <span class="hljs-variable constant_">DAY</span>,
  <span class="hljs-variable constant_">WEEK</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>The drawbacks of this method are:</p>
<ul>
<li>variables are defined as constants, even if we dont need them. Thus it needs useless memory.</li>
<li>each value of the object must be declared as standalone variable</li>
</ul>

<p>Here were using class expressions to get the nested object literal interface we'd want. This is the next best thing IMHO to being able to reference the properties of an object during creation.</p>

<p>Main thing to note is while using this solution, you have exact same interface as you'd have had from an object literal. And the syntax is pretty close to an object literal itself (vs using a function, etc).</p>

<h2>Compare the following</h2>

<h3>Solution I've proposed</h3>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">asd</span> {
    def = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> {

        qwe= <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">ads</span> + <span class="hljs-string">'123'</span>;
    };
</code></pre>

<h3>Solution if object literals would've sufficed</h3>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> asd = {
    def : {
        <span class="hljs-attr">ads</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'asd'</span>,
        <span class="hljs-attr">qwe</span>: <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">ads</span> + <span class="hljs-string">'123'</span>;, <span class="hljs-comment">//ILLEGAL CODE; just to show ideal scenario</span>
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Another example</h2>

<p>Here in this class, you can combine multiple relative path among themselves, which is not possible with an object literal.</p>

         */</span>
        private readonly <span class="hljs-variable constant_">RELATIVE</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> {

<p>If you want to use native JS, the other answers provide good solutions.</p>

<p>But if you're willing to write self-referencing objects like:</p>
