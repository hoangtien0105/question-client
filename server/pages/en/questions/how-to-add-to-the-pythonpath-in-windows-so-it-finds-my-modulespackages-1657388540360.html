<p>You know what has worked for me really well on windows.</p>

<p><code>My Computer &gt; Properties &gt; Advanced System Settings &gt; Environment Variables &gt;</code> </p>

<p>Just add the path as C:\Python27 (or wherever you installed python)</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>Then under system variables I create a new Variable called <code>PythonPath</code>. In this variable I have <code>C:\Python27\Lib;C:\Python27\DLLs;C:\Python27\Lib\lib-tk;C:\other-folders-on-the-path</code></p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZGp36.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Windows 7 Professional
I Modified @mongoose_za's answer to make it easier to change the python version:</p>

<ol>
<li>[Right Click]Computer &gt; Properties &gt;Advanced System Settings &gt; Environment Variables</li>
<li>Click [New] under "System Variable"</li>
<li>Variable Name: PY_HOME, Variable Value:C:\path\to\python\version
<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kqc2E.png" alt="enter image description here"></li>
<li>Click [OK]</li>
<li>Locate the "Path" System variable and click [Edit]</li>
<li><p>Add the following to the existing variable:</p>

<p>%PY_HOME%;%PY_HOME%\Lib;%PY_HOME%\DLLs;%PY_HOME%\Lib\lib-tk;
<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/XK6YH.png" alt="enter image description here"></p></li>
<li><p>Click [OK] to close all of the windows. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>As a final sanity check open a command prompt and enter python. You should see </p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">&gt;python [whatever version you are using]
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to switch between versions, you only need to modify the PY_HOME variable to point to the proper directory. This is bit easier to manage if you need multiple python versions installed. </p>

<p>The easiest way to do that successfully, is to run the python installer again (after the first installation) and then:</p>

<ol>
<li>choose Modify.</li>
<li>check the optional features which you want and click Next.</li>
<li>here we go, in "Advanced Options" step you must see an option saying "Add Python to environment variables". Just check that option and click Install.

<p>The PYTHONPATH environment variable is used by Python to specify a list of directories that modules can be imported from on Windows. When running, you can inspect the <code>sys.path</code> variable to see which directories will be searched when you import something.</p>

<p>To set this variable from the Command Prompt, use: <code>set PYTHONPATH=list;of;paths</code>.</p>

<p>To set this variable from PowerShell, use: <code>$env:PYTHONPATH=list;of;paths</code> just before you launch Python.</p>

<p>Setting this variable globally through the Environment Variables settings is <strong>not</strong> recommended, as it may be used by any version of Python instead of the one that you intend to use.

<p>This question needs a proper answer:</p>
<h1>Just use the standard package <code>site</code>, which was made for this job!</h1>
<p>and here is how (plagiating <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/17811151/2375855">my own answer</a> to my own question on the very same topic):</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>Open a Python prompt and type</li>
</ol>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> site
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>site.USER_SITE
<span class="hljs-string">'C:\\Users\\ojdo\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python37\\site-packages'</span>
...
</code></pre>
<p>(Alternatively, call <code>python -m site --user-site</code> for the same effect.)</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Create this folder if it does not exist yet:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">...
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> os
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>os.makedirs(site.USER_SITE)
...
</code></pre>
<p>(Or, in Bash, your preferred variant of <code>makedirs -p $(python -m site --user-site)</code>.)</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Create a file <code>sitecustomize.py</code> (with exactly this filename, or it won't work) in this folder containing the content of <code>FIND_MY_PACKAGES</code>, either manually or using something like the following code. Of course, you have to change <code>C:\My_Projects</code> to the correct path to your custom import location.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">...
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>FIND_MY_PACKAGES = <span class="hljs-string">"""
import site
site.addsitedir(r'C:\My_Projects')
"""</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>filename = os.path.join(site.USER_SITE, <span class="hljs-string">'sitecustomize.py'</span>)
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(filename, <span class="hljs-string">'w'</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> outfile:
<span class="hljs-meta">... </span>    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(FIND_MY_PACKAGES, file=outfile)
</code></pre>
<p>And the next time you start Python, <code>C:\My_Projects </code> is present in your <code>sys.path</code>, without having to touch system-wide settings. Bonus: the above steps work on Linux, too!</p>
<hr>
<h3>Why does this work?</h3>
<p>From the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation of standard library package <code>site</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Then] an attempt is made to import a module named <code>sitecustomize</code>, which can perform arbitrary site-specific customizations. [...].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you create a module named <code>sitecustomize</code> anywhere in PYTHONPATH, package site will execute it at Python startup. And by calling <code>site.addsitedir</code>, the <code>sys.path</code> can be safely extended to your liking.</p>

<p>In <strong>Python 3.4</strong> on windows it worked when I added it to <strong>PATH enviroment variable</strong> instead of PYTHONPATH. Like if you have installed Python 3.4 in D:\Programming\Python34 then add this at the end of your PATH environment variable</p>

<p>I got it worked in <strong>Windows 10</strong> by following below steps.</p>

<p>Under environment variables, you should only add it under PATH of "<strong>System Variables</strong>" and not under "<strong>User Variables</strong>". This is a great confusion and eats time if we miss it.</p>

<p>Also, just try to navigate to the path where you got Python installed in your machine and add it to PATH. This just works and no need to add any other thing in my case.I added just below path and it worked.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Most important</em>, close command prompt, re-open and then re-try typing "python" to see the version details.</strong> You need to restart command prompt to see the version after setting up the path in environment variables.</p>

<p>After restarting, you should be able <strong>to see the python prompt</strong> and below info when typing python in command prompt:</p>

<p>To augment PYTHONPATH, run regedit and navigate to KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore and then select the folder for the python
version you wish to use. Inside this is a folder labelled PythonPath,
with one entry that specifies the paths where the default install
stores modules. Right-click on PythonPath and choose to create a new
key. You may want to name the key after the project whose module
locations it will specify; this way, you can easily compartmentalize
and track your path modifications.</p>

<p>Maybe a little late, but this is how you add the path to the Windows Environment Variables.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Go to the Environment Variables tab, you do this by pressing Windows key + Pausa inter.</p></li>
<li><p>Go to Advanced System Settings.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on Environment Variables.</p></li>
<li><p>On the lower window search for the 'Path' value.</p></li>
<li><p>Select it</p></li>
<li><p>Click on Edit</p></li>
<li><p>In the end of the line add your instalation folder and the route to 'Scripts' folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Click ok, aceptar etc.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You're done, enter cmd and write python from any location of your drive, it should enter the Python program.</p>

<p>Example with my pc (I have <code>Python34</code>)</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">EXISTING_LINES;C:\Python34;C:\Python34\Scripts\
</code></pre>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<p>While this question is about the 'real' Python, it did come up in a websearch for 'Iron Python PYTHONPATH'. For Iron Python users as confused as I was: It turns out that Iron Python looks for an environment variable called <code>IRONPYTHONPATH</code>.</p>

<p>Linux/Mac/POSIX users: Don't forget that not only does Windows use <code>\</code> as path separators, but it also uses <code>;</code> as path delimiters, not <code>:</code>.</p>
