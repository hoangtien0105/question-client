First recursive loop that converts Array to string and second, that compares two strings. So this method is faster than use of string.\nI believe that larger amounts of data should be always stored in arrays, not in objects. However if you use objects, they can be partially compared too.\nHere&apos;s how:\nComparing objects:\nI&apos;ve stated above, that two object instances will never be equal, even if they contain same data at the moment:\n({a:1, foo:&quot;bar&quot;, numberOfTheBeast: 666}) == ({a:1, foo:&quot;bar&quot;, numberOfTheBeast: 666})  //false\n\nThis has a reason, since there may be, for example private variables within objects.\nHowever, if you just use object structure to contain data, comparing is still possible:\nObject.prototype.equals = function(object2) {\n    //For the first loop, we only check for types\n    for (propName in this) {\n        //Check for inherited methods and properties - like .equals itself\n        //https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty\n        //Return false if the return value is different\n        if (this.hasOwnProperty(propName) != object2.hasOwnProperty(propName)) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        //Check instance type\n        else if (typeof this[propName] != typeof object2[propName]) {\n            //Different types =&gt; not equal\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n    //Now a deeper check using other objects property names\n    for(propName in object2) {\n        //We must check instances anyway, there may be a property that only exists in object2\n            //I wonder, if remembering the checked values from the first loop would be faster or not \n        if (this.hasOwnProperty(propName) != object2.hasOwnProperty(propName)) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        else if (typeof this[propName] != typeof object2[propName]) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        //If the property is inherited, do not check any more (it must be equa if both objects inherit it)\n        if(!this.hasOwnProperty(propName))\n          continue;\n        \n        //Now the detail check and recursion\n        \n        //This returns the script back to the array comparing\n        /**REQUIRES Array.equals**/\n        if (this[propName] instanceof Array &amp;&amp; object2[propName] instanceof Array) {\n                   // recurse into the nested arrays\n           if (!this[propName].equals(object2[propName]))\n                        return false;\n        }\n        else if (this[propName] instanceof Object &amp;&amp; object2[propName] instanceof Object) {\n                   // recurse into another objects\n                   //console.log(&quot;Recursing to compare &quot;, this[propName],&quot;with&quot;,object2[propName], &quot; both named \\&quot;&quot;+propName+&quot;\\&quot;&quot;);\n           if (!this[propName].equals(object2[propName]))\n                        return false;\n        }\n        //Normal value comparison for strings and numbers\n        else if(this[propName] != object2[propName]) {\n           return false;\n        }\n    }\n    //If everything passed, let&apos;s say YES\n    return true;\n}  \n\nHowever, remember that this one is to serve in comparing JSON like data, not class instances and other stuff. If you want to compare more complicated objects, look at this answer and it&apos;s super long function.\nTo make this work with Array.equals you must edit the original function a little bit:\n...\n    // Check if we have nested arrays\n    if (this[i] instanceof Array &amp;&amp; array[i] instanceof Array) {\n        // recurse into the nested arrays\n        if (!this[i].equals(array[i]))\n            return false;\n    }\n    /**REQUIRES OBJECT COMPARE**/\n    else if (this[i] instanceof Object &amp;&amp; array[i] instanceof Object) {\n        // recurse into another objects\n        //console.log(&quot;Recursing to compare &quot;, this[propName],&quot;with&quot;,object2[propName], &quot; both named \\&quot;&quot;+propName+&quot;\\&quot;&quot;);\n        if (!this[i].equals(array[i]))\n            return false;\n        }\n    else if (this[i] != array[i]) {\n...\n\nI made a little test tool for both of the functions.\nBonus: Nested arrays with indexOf and contains\nSamy Bencherif has prepared useful functions for the case you&apos;re searching for a specific object in nested arrays, which are available here: https://jsfiddle.net/SamyBencherif/8352y6yw/\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"While this only works for scalar arrays (see note below), it is short code:\narray1.length === array2.length &amp;&amp; array1.every(function(value, index) { return value === array2[index]})\n\nSame as above but in ECMAScript 6 / CoffeeScript / TypeScript with Arrow Functions:\narray1.length === array2.length &amp;&amp; array1.every((value, index) =&gt; value === array2[index])\n\n(Note: &apos;scalar&apos; here means values that can be compared directly using === .

Tomáš&apos;s solution is a clear improvement over string-based array comparison, but that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s objectively &quot;right&quot;. What is right anyway? Is it the fastest? Is it the most flexible? Is it the easiest to comprehend? Is it the quickest to debug? Does it use the least operations? Does it have any side effects? No one solution can have the best of all the things.\n\nTomáš&apos;s could say his solution is fast but I would also say it is needlessly complicated. It tries to be an all-in-one solution that works for all arrays, nested or not. In fact, it even accepts more than just arrays as an input and still attempts to give a &quot;valid&quot; answer.\n\n\n\nGenerics offer reusability\n\nMy answer will approach the problem differently. I&apos;ll start with a generic arrayCompare procedure that is only concerned with stepping through the arrays. From there, we&apos;ll build our other basic comparison functions like arrayEqual and arrayDeepEqual, etc\n\n// arrayCompare :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool\nconst arrayCompare = f =&gt; ([x,...xs]) =&gt; ([y,...ys]) =&gt;\n  x === undefined &amp;&amp; y === undefined\n    ? true\n    : Boolean (f (x) (y)) &amp;&amp; arrayCompare (f) (xs) (ys)\n\n\nIn my opinion, the best kind of code doesn&apos;t even need comments, and this is no exception. There&apos;s so little happening here that you can understand the behaviour of this procedure with almost no effort at all. Sure, some of the ES6 syntax might seem foreign to you now, but that&apos;s only because ES6 is relatively new. \n\nAs the type suggests, arrayCompare takes comparison function, f, and two input arrays, xs and ys. For the most part, all we do is call f (x) (y) for each element in the input arrays. We return an early false if the user-defined f returns false  thanks to &amp;&amp;&apos;s short-circuit evaluation. So yes, this means the comparator can stop iteration early and prevent looping through the rest of the input array when unnecessary.\n\n\n\nStrict comparison\n\nNext, using our arrayCompare function, we can easily create other functions we might need. We&apos;ll start with the elementary arrayEqual \n\n// equal :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool\nconst equal = x =&gt; y =&gt;\n  x === y // notice: triple equal\n\n// arrayEqual :: [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool\nconst arrayEqual =\n  arrayCompare (equal)\n\nconst xs = [1,2,3]\nconst ys = [1,2,3]\nconsole.log (arrayEqual (xs) (ys))      //=&gt; true\n// (1 === 1) &amp;&amp; (2 === 2) &amp;&amp; (3 === 3)  //=&gt; true\n\nconst zs = [&apos;1&apos;,&apos;2&apos;,&apos;3&apos;]\nconsole.log (arrayEqual (xs) (zs))      //=&gt; false\n// (1 === &apos;1&apos;)                          //=&gt; false\n\n\nSimple as that. arrayEqual can be defined with arrayCompare and a comparator function that compares a to b using === (for strict equality).\n\nNotice that we also define equal as it&apos;s own function. This highlights the role of arrayCompare as a higher-order function to utilize our first order comparator in the context of another data type (Array).\n\n\n\nLoose comparison\n\nWe could just as easily defined arrayLooseEqual using a == instead. Now when comparing 1 (Number) to &apos;1&apos; (String), the result will be true \n\n// looseEqual :: a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool\nconst looseEqual = x =&gt; y =&gt;\n  x == y // notice: double equal\n\n// arrayLooseEqual :: [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool\nconst arrayLooseEqual =\n  arrayCompare (looseEqual)\n\nconst xs = [1,2,3]\nconst ys = [&apos;1&apos;,&apos;2&apos;,&apos;3&apos;]\nconsole.log (arrayLooseEqual (xs) (ys))    //=&gt; true\n// (1 == &apos;1&apos;) &amp;&amp; (2 == &apos;2&apos;) &amp;&amp; (3 == &apos;3&apos;)  //=&gt; true\n\n\n\n\nDeep comparison (recursive)\n\nYou&apos;ve probably noticed that this is only shallow comparison tho. Surely Tomáš&apos;s solution is &quot;The Right Way&quot; because it does implicit deep comparison, right ?\n\nWell our arrayCompare procedure is versatile enough to use in a way that makes a deep equality test a breeze \n\n// isArray :: a -&gt; Bool\nconst isArray =\n  Array.isArray\n\n// arrayDeepCompare :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool\nconst arrayDeepCompare = f =&gt;\n  arrayCompare (a =&gt; b =&gt;\n    isArray (a) &amp;&amp; isArray (b)\n      ? arrayDeepCompare (f) (a) (b)\n      : f (a) (b))\n\nconst xs = [1,[2,[3]]]\nconst ys = [1,[2,[&apos;3&apos;]]]\nconsole.log (arrayDeepCompare (equal) (xs) (ys)) //=&gt; false\n// (1 === 1) &amp;&amp; (2 === 2) &amp;&amp; (3 === &apos;3&apos;)         //=&gt; false\n\nconsole.log (arrayDeepCompare (looseEqual) (xs) (ys)) //=&gt; true\n// (1 == 1) &amp;&amp; (2 == 2) &amp;&amp; (3 == &apos;3&apos;)                 //=&gt; true\n\n\nSimple as that. We build a deep comparator using another higher-order function. This time we&apos;re wrapping arrayCompare using a custom comparator that will check if a and b are arrays. If so, reapply arrayDeepCompare otherwise compare a and b to the user-specified comparator (f). This allows us to keep the deep comparison behavior separate from how we actually compare the individual elements. Ie, like the example above shows, we can deep compare using equal, looseEqual, or any other comparator we make.\n\nBecause arrayDeepCompare is curried, we can partially apply it like we did in the previous examples too\n\n// arrayDeepEqual :: [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool\nconst arrayDeepEqual =\n  arrayDeepCompare (equal)\n\n// arrayDeepLooseEqual :: [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool\nconst arrayDeepLooseEqual =\n  arrayDeepCompare (looseEqual)\n\n\nTo me, this already a clear improvement over Tomáš&apos;s solution because I can explicitly choose a shallow or deep comparison for my arrays, as needed.\n\n\n\nObject comparison (example)\n\nNow what if you have an array of objects or something ? Maybe you want to consider those arrays as &quot;equal&quot; if each object has the same id value \n\n// idEqual :: {id: Number} -&gt; {id: Number} -&gt; Bool\nconst idEqual = x =&gt; y =&gt;\n  x.id !== undefined &amp;&amp; x.id === y.id\n\n// arrayIdEqual :: [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool\nconst arrayIdEqual =\n  arrayCompare (idEqual)\n\nconst xs = [{id:1}, {id:2}]\nconst ys = [{id:1}, {id:2}]\nconsole.log (arrayIdEqual (xs) (ys)) //=&gt; true\n// (1 === 1) &amp;&amp; (2 === 2)            //=&gt; true\n\nconst zs = [{id:1}, {id:6}]\nconsole.log (arrayIdEqual (xs) (zs)) //=&gt; false\n// (1 === 1) &amp;&amp; (2 === 6)            //=&gt; false\n\n\nSimple as that. Here I&apos;ve used vanilla JS objects, but this type of comparator could work for any object type; even your custom objects. Tomáš&apos;s solution would need to be completely reworked to support this kind of equality test\n\nDeep array with objects? Not a problem. We built highly versatile, generic functions, so they&apos;ll work in a wide variety of use cases.\n\nconst xs = [{id:1}, [{id:2}]]\nconst ys = [{id:1}, [{id:2}]]\nconsole.log (arrayCompare (idEqual) (xs) (ys))     //=&gt; false\nconsole.log (arrayDeepCompare (idEqual) (xs) (ys)) //=&gt; true\n\n\n\n\nArbitrary comparison (example)\n\nOr what if you wanted to do some other kind of kind of completely arbitrary comparison ? Maybe I want to know if each x is greater than each y \n\n// gt :: Number -&gt; Number -&gt; Bool\nconst gt = x =&gt; y =&gt;\n  x &gt; y\n\n// arrayGt :: [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool\nconst arrayGt = arrayCompare (gt)\n\nconst xs = [5,10,20]\nconst ys = [2,4,8]\nconsole.log (arrayGt (xs) (ys))     //=&gt; true\n// (5 &gt; 2) &amp;&amp; (10 &gt; 4) &amp;&amp; (20 &gt; 8)  //=&gt; true\n\nconst zs = [6,12,24]\nconsole.log (arrayGt (xs) (zs))     //=&gt; false\n// (5 &gt; 6)                          //=&gt; false\n\n\n\n\nLess is More\n\nYou can see we&apos;re actually doing more with less code. There&apos;s nothing complicated about arrayCompare itself and each of the custom comparators we&apos;ve made have a very simple implementation.\n\nWith ease, we can define exactly how we wish for two arrays to be compared  shallow, deep, strict, loose, some object property, or some arbitrary computation, or any combination of these  all using one procedure, arrayCompare. Maybe even dream up a RegExp comparator ! I know how kids love those regexps \n\nIs it the fastest? Nope. But it probably doesn&apos;t need to be either. If speed is the only metric used to measure the quality of our code, a lot of really great code would get thrown away  That&apos;s why I&apos;m calling this approach The Practical Way. Or maybe to be more fair, A Practical Way. This description is suitable for this answer because I&apos;m not saying this answer is only practical in comparison to some other answer; it is objectively true. We&apos;ve attained a high degree of practicality with very little code that&apos;s very easy to reason about. No other code can say we haven&apos;t earned this description.\n\nDoes that make it the &quot;right&quot; solution for you ? That&apos;s up for you to decide. And no one else can do that for you; only you know what your needs are. In almost all cases, I value straightforward, practical, and versatile code over clever and fast kind. What you value might differ, so pick what works for you.\n\n\n\nEdit\n\nMy old answer was more focused on decomposing arrayEqual into tiny procedures. It&apos;s an interesting exercise, but not really the best (most practical) way to approach this problem.

In light of this, I modified the function to handle comparing arrays for similarity - i.e. they have the same elements, but out of order - for personal use, and thought I&apos;d throw it on here for everyone to see.\n\nArray.prototype.equals = function (array, strict) {\n    if (!array)\n        return false;\n\n    if (arguments.length == 1)\n        strict = true;\n\n    if (this.length != array.length)\n        return false;\n\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; this.length; i++) {\n        if (this[i] instanceof Array &amp;&amp; array[i] instanceof Array) {\n            if (!this[i].equals(array[i], strict))\n                return false;\n        }\n        else if (strict &amp;&amp; this[i] != array[i]) {\n            return false;\n        }\n        else if (!strict) {\n            return this.sort().equals(array.sort(), true);\n        }\n    }\n    return true;\n}\n\n\nThis function takes an additional parameter of strict that defaults to true.  This strict parameter defines if the arrays need to be wholly equal in both contents and the order of those contents, or simply just contain the same contents.\n\nExample:\n\nvar arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];\nvar arr2 = [2, 1, 4, 3];  // Loosely equal to 1\nvar arr3 = [2, 2, 3, 4];  // Not equal to 1\nvar arr4 = [1, 2, 3, 4];  // Strictly equal to 1\n\narr1.equals(arr2);         // false\narr1.equals(arr2, false);  // true\narr1.equals(arr3);         // false\narr1.equals(arr3, false);  // false\narr1.equals(arr4);         // true\narr1.equals(arr4, false);  // true\n\n\nI&apos;ve also written up a quick jsfiddle with the function and this example:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/Roundaround/DLkxX/\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution8","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"On the same lines as JSON.encode is to use join().\n\nfunction checkArrays( arrA, arrB ){\n\n    //check if lengths are different\n    if(arrA.length !== arrB.length) return false;\n\n\n    //slice so we do not effect the original\n    //sort makes sure they are in order\n    //join makes it a string so we can do a string compare\n    var cA = arrA.slice().sort().join(&quot;,&quot;); \n    var cB = arrB.slice().sort().join(&quot;,&quot;);\n\n    return cA===cB;\n\n}\n\nvar a = [1,2,3,4,5];\nvar b = [5,4,3,2,1];\nvar c = [1,2,3,4];\nvar d = [1,2,3,4,6];\nvar e = [&quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;3&quot;,&quot;4&quot;,&quot;5&quot;];  //will return true\n\nconsole.log( checkArrays(a,b) );  //true\nconsole.log( checkArrays(a,c) );  //false\nconsole.log( checkArrays(a,d) );  //false\nconsole.log( checkArrays(a,e) );  //true\n\n\nOnly problem is if you care about types which the last comparison tests.\nIf you care about types, you will have to loop.\n\nfunction checkArrays( arrA, arrB ){\n\n    //check if lengths are different\n    if(arrA.length !== arrB.length) return false;\n\n    //slice so we do not effect the orginal\n    //sort makes sure they are in order\n    var cA = arrA.slice().sort(); \n    var cB = arrB.slice().sort();\n\n    for(var i=0;i&lt;cA.length;i++){\n         if(cA[i]!==cB[i]) return false;\n    }\n\n    return true;\n\n}\n\nvar a = [1,2,3,4,5];\nvar b = [5,4,3,2,1];\nvar c = [1,2,3,4];\nvar d = [1,2,3,4,6];\nvar e = [&quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;3&quot;,&quot;4&quot;,&quot;5&quot;];\n\nconsole.log( checkArrays(a,b) );  //true\nconsole.log( checkArrays(a,c) );  //false\nconsole.log( checkArrays(a,d) );  //false\nconsole.log( checkArrays(a,e) );  //false\n\n\nIf the order should remain the same, than it is just a loop, no sort is needed.\n\nfunction checkArrays( arrA, arrB ){\n\n    //check if lengths are different\n    if(arrA.length !== arrB.length) return false;\n\n\n    for(var i=0;i&lt;arrA.length;i++){\n         if(arrA[i]!==arrB[i]) return false;\n    }\n\n    return true;\n\n}\n\nvar a = [1,2,3,4,5];\nvar b = [5,4,3,2,1];\nvar c = [1,2,3,4];\nvar d = [1,2,3,4,6];\nvar e = [&quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;3&quot;,&quot;4&quot;,&quot;5&quot;];\n\nconsole.log( checkArrays(a,a) );  //true\nconsole.log( checkArrays(a,b) );  //false\nconsole.log( checkArrays(a,c) );  //false\nconsole.log( checkArrays(a,d) );  //false\nconsole.log( checkArrays(a,e) );  //false\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution9","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"In my case compared arrays contain only numbers and strings.

In this case, the 1 and the [1, 2, 3] are both converted to a string.\nInternally, JavaScript uses [1, 2, 3].join() to convert the array to a string and then adds them resulting in 11,2,3. When doing this on both arrays, one can simply use === or == to compare the two strings.\nFlaws\nUsing this technique, the comparison does not care if the elements in the arrays to be compared are of different types. [1, 2] will be equal to [&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;] because of the string conversion.\nEDIT: As pointed out in the comments, comparing string arrays can produce false positives, such as [&quot;1,2&quot;] being &apos;equal&apos; to [&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;]. This is of no concern if you are sure these never occur (e.g. in many code golfing challenges).\nDisclaimer\nWhile this is useful for code golfing, it should probably not be used in production code.

<p>I'd like to compare two arrays... ideally, efficiently. Nothing fancy, just <code>true</code> if they are identical, and <code>false</code> if not. Not surprisingly, the comparison operator doesn't seem to work.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a1 = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>];

<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(a1==a2);    <span class="hljs-comment">// Returns false</span>
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-title class_">JSON</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">stringify</span>(a1)==<span class="hljs-title class_">JSON</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">stringify</span>(a2));    <span class="hljs-comment">// Returns true</span>
</code></pre>

<p>JSON encoding each array does, but is there a faster or "better" way to simply compare arrays without having to iterate through each value?</p>

<p>You may say "<em>But it is much faster to compare strings - no loops...</em>" well, then you should note there ARE loops. First recursive loop that converts Array to string and second, that compares two strings. So this method <strong>is faster than use of string</strong>.</p>
<p><sub>I believe that larger amounts of data should be always stored in arrays, not in objects. However if you use objects, they can be partially compared too.<br>
<strong>Here's how:</strong></sub></p>
<h2>Comparing objects:</h2>
<p>I've stated above, that two object <strong>instances</strong> will never be equal, even if they contain same data at the moment:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">({<span class="hljs-attr">a</span>:<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">foo</span>:<span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">numberOfTheBeast</span>: <span class="hljs-number">666</span>}) == ({<span class="hljs-attr">a</span>:<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">foo</span>:<span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">numberOfTheBeast</span>: <span class="hljs-number">666</span>})  <span class="hljs-comment">//false</span>

<p>This has a reason, since there may be, for example <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/201471/607407">private variables within objects.</a></p>
<p>However, if you just use object structure to contain data, comparing is still possible:</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>
<p>From what I read in the comments, sorting the array and comparing may give accurate result:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> array2Sorted = array2.<span class="hljs-title function_">slice</span>().<span class="hljs-title function_">sort</span>();

<p>Eg:</p>

<p>This I think is the simplest way to do it using JSON stringify, and it may be the best solution in some situations:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title class_">JSON</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">stringify</span>(a1) === <span class="hljs-title class_">JSON</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">stringify</span>(a2);

<p>This converts the objects <code>a1</code> and <code>a2</code> into strings so they can be compared. The order is important in most cases, for that can sort the object using a sort algorithm shown in one of the above answers.</p>

<h3>The Practical Way</h3>

<p>I think it's wrong to say a particular implementation is "The Right Way" if it's only "right" ("correct") in contrast to a "wrong" solution. Tomáš's solution is a clear improvement over string-based array comparison, but that doesn't mean it's objectively "right". What is <em>right</em> anyway? Is it the fastest? Is it the most flexible? Is it the easiest to comprehend? Is it the quickest to debug? Does it use the least operations? Does it have any side effects? No one solution can have the best of all the things.</p>

<p>Tomáš's could say his solution is fast but I would also say it is needlessly complicated. It tries to be an all-in-one solution that works for all arrays, nested or not. In fact, it even accepts more than just arrays as an input and still attempts to give a "valid" answer.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Generics offer reusability</h3>

<p>My answer will approach the problem differently. I'll start with a generic <code>arrayCompare</code> procedure that is only concerned with stepping through the arrays. From there, we'll build our other basic comparison functions like <code>arrayEqual</code> and <code>arrayDeepEqual</code>, etc</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// arrayCompare :: (a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">arrayCompare</span> = f =&gt; <span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">[x,...xs]</span>) =&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">[y,...ys]</span>) =&gt;</span>
  x === <span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span> &amp;&amp; y === <span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span>
    ? <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
    : <span class="hljs-title class_">Boolean</span> (f (x) (y)) &amp;&amp; arrayCompare (f) (xs) (ys)
</code></pre>

<p>In my opinion, the best kind of code doesn't even need comments, and this is no exception. There's so little happening here that you can understand the behaviour of this procedure with almost no effort at all. Sure, some of the ES6 syntax might seem foreign to you now, but that's only because ES6 is relatively new. </p>

<p>As the type suggests, <code>arrayCompare</code> takes comparison function, <code>f</code>, and two input arrays, <code>xs</code> and <code>ys</code>. For the most part, all we do is call <code>f (x) (y)</code> for each element in the input arrays. We return an early <code>false</code> if the user-defined <code>f</code> returns <code>false</code>  thanks to <code>&amp;&amp;</code>'s short-circuit evaluation. So yes, this means the comparator can stop iteration early and prevent looping through the rest of the input array when unnecessary.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Strict comparison</h3>

<p>Next, using our <code>arrayCompare</code> function, we can easily create other functions we might need. We'll start with the elementary <code>arrayEqual</code> </p>

<p>Simple as that. <code>arrayEqual</code> can be defined with <code>arrayCompare</code> and a comparator function that compares <code>a</code> to <code>b</code> using <code>===</code> (for strict equality).</p>

<p>Notice that we also define <code>equal</code> as it's own function. This highlights the role of <code>arrayCompare</code> as a higher-order function to utilize our first order comparator in the context of another data type (Array).</p>

<h3>Loose comparison</h3>

<p>We could just as easily defined <code>arrayLooseEqual</code> using a <code>==</code> instead. Now when comparing <code>1</code> (Number) to <code>'1'</code> (String), the result will be <code>true</code> </p>

<h3>Deep comparison (recursive)</h3>

<p>You've probably noticed that this is only shallow comparison tho. Surely Tomáš's solution is "The Right Way" because it does implicit deep comparison, right ?</p>

<p>Well our <code>arrayCompare</code> procedure is versatile enough to use in a way that makes a deep equality test a breeze </p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// isArray :: a -&gt; Bool</span>

</code></pre>

<p>Simple as that. We build a deep comparator using <em>another</em> higher-order function. This time we're wrapping <code>arrayCompare</code> using a custom comparator that will check if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are arrays. If so, reapply <code>arrayDeepCompare</code> otherwise compare <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> to the user-specified comparator (<code>f</code>). This allows us to keep the deep comparison behavior separate from how we actually compare the individual elements. Ie, like the example above shows, we can deep compare using <code>equal</code>, <code>looseEqual</code>, or any other comparator we make.</p>

<p>Because <code>arrayDeepCompare</code> is curried, we can partially apply it like we did in the previous examples too</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// arrayDeepEqual :: [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> arrayDeepEqual =

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> arrayDeepLooseEqual =
  arrayDeepCompare (looseEqual)
</code></pre>

<p>To me, this already a clear improvement over Tomáš's solution because I can <em>explicitly</em> choose a shallow or deep comparison for my arrays, as needed.</p>

<h3>Object comparison (example)</h3>

<p>Now what if you have an array of objects or something ? Maybe you want to consider those arrays as "equal" if each object has the same <code>id</code> value </p>

</code></pre>

<p>Simple as that. Here I've used vanilla JS objects, but this type of comparator could work for <em>any</em> object type; even your custom objects. Tomáš's solution would need to be completely reworked to support this kind of equality test</p>

<p>Deep array with objects? Not a problem. We built highly versatile, generic functions, so they'll work in a wide variety of use cases.</p>

<h3>Less is More</h3>

<p>You can see we're actually doing more with less code. There's nothing complicated about <code>arrayCompare</code> itself and each of the custom comparators we've made have a very simple implementation.</p>

<p>With ease, we can define exactly how we wish for two arrays to be compared  shallow, deep, strict, loose, some object property, or some arbitrary computation, or any combination of these  <strong>all using one procedure</strong>, <code>arrayCompare</code>. Maybe even dream up a <code>RegExp</code> comparator ! I know how kids love those regexps </p>

<p>Is it the fastest? Nope. But it probably doesn't need to be either. If speed is the only metric used to measure the quality of our code, a lot of really great code would get thrown away  That's why I'm calling this approach <strong>The Practical Way</strong>. Or maybe to be more fair, <em>A</em> Practical Way. This description is suitable for this answer because I'm not saying this answer is only practical in comparison to some other answer; it is objectively true. We've attained a high degree of practicality with very little code that's very easy to reason about. No other code can say we haven't earned this description.</p>

<p>Does that make it the "right" solution for you ? That's up for <em>you</em> to decide. And no one else can do that for you; only you know what your needs are. In almost all cases, I value straightforward, practical, and versatile code over clever and fast kind. What you value might differ, so pick what works for you.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Edit</h3>

<p>My old answer was more focused on decomposing <code>arrayEqual</code> into tiny procedures. It's an interesting exercise, but not really the best (most practical) way to approach this problem. If you're interested, you can see this revision history.</p>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution7" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl solution-inner border md:px-10 md:py-10 px-2 py-10 shadow-md bg-white"><div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-between"><h1 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 7</h1><div class="tags-wrap h-max space-x-8"><div class="tags"></div></div></div><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>It's unclear what you mean by "identical". For example, are the arrays <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> below identical (note the nested arrays)?</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = [<span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>, [<span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span>]], b = [<span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>, [<span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span>]];
</code></pre>

<p>Here's an optimized array comparison function that compares corresponding elements of each array in turn using strict equality and does not do recursive comparison of array elements that are themselves arrays, meaning that for the above example, <code>arraysIdentical(a, b)</code> would return <code>false</code>.

<p>Building off Tomáš Zato's answer, I agree that just iterating through the arrays is the fastest.  Additionally (like others have already stated), the function should be called equals/equal, not compare.  In light of this, I modified the function to handle comparing arrays for similarity - i.e. they have the same elements, but out of order - for personal use, and thought I'd throw it on here for everyone to see.</p>

<p>Even though this has a lot of answers, one that I believe to be of help:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> newArray = [ ...<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Set</span>( [...arr1, ...arr2] ) ]
</code></pre>

<p>It is not stated in the question how the structure of the array is going to look like, so If you know for sure that you <strong>won't have nested arrays nor objects</strong> in you array (it happened to me, that's why I came to this answer) the above code will work.</p>

<p>What happens is that we use spread operator ( ... ) to concat both arrays, then we use Set to eliminate any duplicates. Once you have that you can compare their sizes, if all three arrays have the same size you are good to go.</p>

<p>This answer also <strong>ignores the order of elements</strong>, as I said, the exact situation happened to me, so maybe someone in the same situation might end up here (as I did).</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit1.</p>

<p>Answering Dmitry Grinko's question: "Why did you use spread operator ( ... ) here - ...new Set ? It doesn't work"</p>

<p>Consider this code:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> arr1 = [ <span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'b'</span> ]
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> arr2 = [ <span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'c'</span> ]
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> newArray = [ <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Set</span>( [...arr1, ...arr2] ) ]
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(newArray)
</code></pre>

<p>You'll get</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">[ <span class="hljs-title class_">Set</span> { <span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'c'</span> } ]
</code></pre>

<p>In order to work with that value you'd need to use some Set properties (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set" rel="noreferrer">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set</a>).
On the other hand, when you use this code:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> arr1 = [ <span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'b'</span> ]
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> arr2 = [ <span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'c'</span> ]
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> newArray = [ ...<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Set</span>( [...arr1, ...arr2] ) ]
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(newArray)
</code></pre>

<p>You'll get</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">[ <span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'c'</span> ]
</code></pre>

<p>That's the difference, the former would give me a Set, it would work too as I could get the size of that Set, but the latter gives me the array I need, what's more direct to the resolution.</p>

<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>This works because when using the <code>+</code> operator, the types are automatically converted to allow concatenation. In this case, the <code>1</code> and the <code>[1, 2, 3]</code> are both converted to a string.</p>
<p>Internally, JavaScript uses <code>[1, 2, 3].join()</code> to convert the array to a string and then adds them resulting in <code>11,2,3</code>. When doing this on both arrays, one can simply use <code>===</code> or <code>==</code> to compare the two strings.</p>
<h2>Flaws</h2>
<p>Using this technique, the comparison does not care if the elements in the arrays to be compared are of different types. <code>[1, 2]</code> will be equal to <code>["1", "2"]</code> because of the string conversion.</p>
<p>EDIT: As pointed out in the comments, comparing string arrays can produce false positives, such as <code>["1,2"]</code> being 'equal' to <code>["1", "2"]</code>. This is of no concern if you are sure these never occur (e.g. in many code golfing challenges).</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>While this is useful for code golfing, it should probably not be used in production code. The two flaws pointed out aren't helping that either.</p>

<p>Works with any nested data structure, and obviously ignores objects' methods. Don't even think of extending Object.prototype with this method, when I tried this once, jQuery broke ;)</p>

<p>For most arrays it's still faster than most of serialization solutions. It's probably the fastest compare method for arrays of object records.</p>

<p>Already some great answers.But i would like to share anther idea which has proven to be reliable in comparing arrays. We can compare two array using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong>JSON.stringify ( )</strong></a> . It will create a string out the the array and thus compare two obtained strings from two array for equality</p>

Tomáš\u0026apos;s solution is a clear improvement over string-based array comparison, but that doesn\u0026apos;t mean it\u0026apos;s objectively \u0026quot;right\u0026quot;. What is \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;right\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; anyway? Is it the fastest? Is it the most flexible? Is it the easiest to comprehend? Is it the quickest to debug? Does it use the least operations? Does it have any side effects? No one solution can have the best of all the things.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Tomáš\u0026apos;s could say his solution is fast but I would also say it is needlessly complicated. It tries to be an all-in-one solution that works for all arrays, nested or not.

There\u0026apos;s so little happening here that you can understand the behaviour of this procedure with almost no effort at all. Sure, some of the ES6 syntax might seem foreign to you now, but that\u0026apos;s only because ES6 is relatively new. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;As the type suggests, \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;arrayCompare\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; takes comparison function, \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;f\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, and two input arrays, \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;xs\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ys\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. For the most part, all we do is call \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;f (x) (y)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; for each element in the input arrays. We return an early \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;false\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; if the user-defined \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;f\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; returns \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;false\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;  thanks to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;\u0026amp;amp;\u0026amp;amp;\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026apos;s short-circuit evaluation. So yes, this means the comparator can stop iteration early and prevent looping through the rest of the input array when unnecessary.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Strict comparison\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Next, using our \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;arrayCompare\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; function, we can easily create other functions we might need.

In almost all cases, I value straightforward, practical, and versatile code over clever and fast kind. What you value might differ, so pick what works for you.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Edit\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;My old answer was more focused on decomposing \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;arrayEqual\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; into tiny procedures.

When doing this on both arrays, one can simply use \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;===\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;==\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to compare the two strings.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Flaws\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Using this technique, the comparison does not care if the elements in the arrays to be compared are of different types. \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;[1, 2]\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; will be equal to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;[\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2\u0026quot;]\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; because of the string conversion.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;EDIT: As pointed out in the comments, comparing string arrays can produce false positives, such as \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;[\u0026quot;1,2\u0026quot;]\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; being \u0026apos;equal\u0026apos; to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;[\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2\u0026quot;]\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.
