Basic answer\nYou can use the header() function to send a new HTTP header, but this must be sent to the browser before any HTML or text (so before the &lt;!DOCTYPE ...&gt; declaration, for example).\nheader(&apos;Location: &apos;.$newURL);\n\n2. Important details\ndie() or exit()\nheader(&quot;Location: https://example.com/myOtherPage.php&quot;);\ndie();\n\nWhy you should use die() or exit(): The Daily WTF\nAbsolute or relative URL\nSince June 2014 both absolute and relative URLs can be used. See RFC 7231 which had replaced the old RFC 2616, where only absolute URLs were allowed.\nStatus Codes\nPHP&apos;s &quot;Location&quot;-header still uses the HTTP 302-redirect code, this is a &quot;temporary&quot; redirect and may not be the one you should use. You should consider either 301 (permanent redirect) or 303 (other).\nNote: W3C mentions that the 303-header is incompatible with &quot;many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents. Currently used browsers are all HTTP/1.1 user agents. This is not true for many other user agents like spiders and robots.\n3. Documentation\nHTTP Headers and the header() function in PHP\n\nWhat the PHP manual says\nWhat Wikipedia says\nWhat the W3C says\n\n4. Alternatives\nYou may use the alternative method of http_redirect($url); which needs the PECL package pecl to be installed.\n5. Helper Functions\nThis function doesn&apos;t incorporate the 303 status code:\nfunction Redirect($url, $permanent = false)\n{\n    header(&apos;Location: &apos; . $url, true, $permanent ? 301 : 302);\n\n    exit();\n}\n\nRedirect(&apos;https://example.com/&apos;, false);\n\nThis is more flexible:\nfunction redirect($url, $statusCode = 303)\n{\n   header(&apos;Location: &apos; . $url, true, $statusCode);\n   die();\n}\n\n6. Workaround\nAs mentioned header() redirects only work before anything is written out. They usually fail if invoked inmidst HTML output. Then you might use a HTML header workaround (not very professional!) like:\n &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;refresh&quot; content=&quot;0;url=finalpage.html&quot;&gt;\n\nOr a JavaScript redirect even.\nwindow.location.replace(&quot;https://example.com/&quot;);\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Use the header() function to send an HTTP Location header:\n\nheader(&apos;Location: &apos;.$newURL);\n\n\nContrary to what some think, die() has nothing to do with redirection. Use it only if you want to redirect instead of normal execution.\n\nFile example.php:\n\n&lt;?php\n    header(&apos;Location: static.html&apos;);\n    $fh = fopen(&apos;/tmp/track.txt&apos;, &apos;a&apos;);\n    fwrite($fh, $_SERVER[&apos;REMOTE_ADDR&apos;] . &apos; &apos; . date(&apos;c&apos;) . &quot;\\n&quot;);\n    fclose($fh);\n?&gt;\n\n\nResult of three executions:\n\nbart@hal9k:~&gt; cat /tmp/track.txt\n127.0.0.1 2009-04-21T09:50:02+02:00\n127.0.0.1 2009-04-21T09:50:05+02:00\n127.0.0.1 2009-04-21T09:50:08+02:00\n\n\nResuming  obligatory die()/exit() is some urban legend that has nothing to do with actual PHP. It has nothing to do with client &quot;respecting&quot; the Location: header.

That might be too much of a hassle. Remember that headers are the first thing that is sent from the page. Most of the redirect is usually required later in the page. For that you have to buffer all the output of the page and check for redirect condition later. At that point you can either redirect page user header() or simply echo the buffered output.\n\nFor more about buffering (advantages)\n\nWhat is output buffering?\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"\n1.

Here are the descriptions:\n\n\n301 - Moved Permanently\n302 - Found\n303 - See Other\n307 - Temporary Redirect (HTTP/1.1)\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution12","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"To redirect the visitor to another page (particularly useful in a conditional loop), simply use the following code:\n\n&lt;?php\n    header(&apos;Location: mypage.php&apos;);\n?&gt;\n\n\nIn this case, mypage.php is the address of the page to which you would like to redirect the visitors. This address can be absolute and may also include the parameters in this format: mypage.php?param1=val1&amp;m2=val2)\n\nRelative/Absolute Path\n\nWhen dealing with relative or absolute paths, it is ideal to choose an absolute path from the root of the server (DOCUMENT_ROOT). Use the following format:\n\n&lt;?php\n    header(&apos;Location: /directory/mypage.php&apos;);\n?&gt;\n\n\nIf ever the target page is on another server, you include the full URL:\n\n&lt;?php\n    header(&apos;Location: http://www.ccm.net/forum/&apos;);\n?&gt;\n\n\nHTTP Headers\n\nAccording to HTTP protocol, HTTP headers must be sent before any type of content. This means that no characters should ever be sent before the header  not even an empty space!\n\nTemporary/Permanent Redirections\n\nBy default, the type of redirection presented above is a temporary one. This means that search engines, such as Google Search, will not take the redirection into account when indexing.\n\nIf you would like to notify search engines that a page has been permanently moved to another location, use the following code:\n\n&lt;?\n    header(&apos;Status: 301 Moved Permanently&apos;, false, 301);\n    header(&apos;Location: new_address&apos;);\n?&gt;\n\n\nFor example, this page has the following code:\n\n&lt;?\n    header(&apos;Status: 301 Moved Permanently&apos;, false, 301);\n    header(&apos;Location: /pc/imprimante.php3&apos;);\n    exit();\n?&gt;\n\n\nWhen you click on the link above, you are automatically redirected to this page. Moreover, it is a permanent redirection (Status: 301 Moved Permanently). So, if you type the first URL into Google, you will automatically be redirected to the second, redirected link.\n\nInterpretation of PHP Code\n\nThe PHP code located after the header() will be interpreted by the server, even if the visitor moves to the address specified in the redirection. In most cases, this means that you need a method to follow the header() function of the exit() function in order to decrease the load of the server:\n\n&lt;?\n    header(&apos;Status: 301 Moved Permanently&apos;, false, 301);\n    header(&apos;Location: address&apos;);\n    exit();\n?&gt;\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution13","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Use:\n\n&lt;?php\n    header(&apos;Location: redirectpage.php&apos;);\n    header(&apos;Location: redirectpage.php&apos;);\n    exit();\n    echo &quot;&lt;script&gt;location.href=&apos;redirectpage.php&apos;;&lt;/script&gt;&quot;;\n?&gt;\n\n\nThis is a regular and normal PHP redirect, but you can make a redirecting page with a few seconds wait by the below code:\n\n&lt;?php\n    header(&apos;refresh:5;url=redirectpage.php &apos;); // Note: here 5 means 5 seconds wait for redirect.\n?&gt;\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution14","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Yes, it&apos;s possible to use PHP.

<p>Is it possible to redirect a user to a different page through the use of PHP?</p>

<p>Say the user goes to <code>www.example.com/page.php</code> and I want to redirect them to <code>www.example.com/index.php</code>, how would I do so without the use of a meta refresh? Is it possible?</p>

<p>This could even protect my pages from unauthorized users.</p>

<p>Summary of existing answers plus my own two cents:</p>
<h2>1. Basic answer</h2>
<p>You can use the <code>header()</code> function to send a new HTTP header, but this must be sent to the browser before any HTML or text (so before the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE ...&gt;</code> declaration, for example).</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">header</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Location: '</span>.<span class="hljs-variable">$newURL</span>);
</code></pre>
<h2>2. Important details</h2>
<p><strong>die()</strong> or <strong>exit()</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">header</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Location: https://example.com/myOtherPage.php"</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">die</span>();
</code></pre>
<p>Why you should use <code>die()</code> or <code>exit()</code>: <a href="https://thedailywtf.com/Articles/WellIntentioned-Destruction.aspx" rel="noreferrer">The Daily WTF</a></p>
<p><strong>Absolute or relative URL</strong></p>
<p>Since June 2014 both absolute and relative URLs can be used. See <a href="https://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/rfc7231.html#header.location" rel="noreferrer">RFC 7231</a> which had replaced the old <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.30" rel="noreferrer">RFC 2616</a>, where only absolute URLs were allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Status Codes</strong></p>
<p>PHP's "Location"-header still uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_302" rel="noreferrer">HTTP 302</a>-redirect code, this is a "temporary" redirect and may not be the one you should use. You should consider either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_301" rel="noreferrer">301</a> (permanent redirect) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_303" rel="noreferrer">303</a> (other).</p>
<p>Note: <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.4" rel="noreferrer">W3C mentions</a> that the 303-header is incompatible with "many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents. Currently used browsers are all HTTP/1.1 user agents. This is not true for many other user agents like spiders and robots.</p>
<h2>3. Documentation</h2>
<p>HTTP Headers and the <code>header()</code> function in PHP</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.header.php" rel="noreferrer">What the PHP manual says</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_headers#Responses" rel="noreferrer">What Wikipedia says</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.30" rel="noreferrer">What the W3C says</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Alternatives</h2>
<p>You may use the alternative method of <code>http_redirect($url);</code> which needs the <a href="https://pecl.php.net/package/pecl_http" rel="noreferrer">PECL package pecl</a> to be installed.</p>
<h2>5. Helper Functions</h2>
<p>This function doesn't incorporate the 303 status code:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">Redirect</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-variable">$url</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$permanent</span> = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span></span>)
</span>{
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">header</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Location: '</span> . <span class="hljs-variable">$url</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$permanent</span> ? <span class="hljs-number">301</span> : <span class="hljs-number">302</span>);

    <span class="hljs-keyword">exit</span>();
}

<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">Redirect</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'https://example.com/'</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>This is more flexible:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">redirect</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-variable">$url</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$statusCode</span> = <span class="hljs-number">303</span></span>)
</span>{
   <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">header</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Location: '</span> . <span class="hljs-variable">$url</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>, <span class="hljs-variable">$statusCode</span>);
   <span class="hljs-keyword">die</span>();
}
</code></pre>
<h2>6. Workaround</h2>
<p>As mentioned <code>header()</code> redirects only work before anything is written out. They usually fail if <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8028957/warning-headers-already-sent-in-php">invoked inmidst HTML</a> output. Then you might use a HTML header workaround (not very professional!) like:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"> &lt;meta http-equiv=<span class="hljs-string">"refresh"</span> content=<span class="hljs-string">"0;url=finalpage.html"</span>&gt;

<p>You can't really do it in PHP unless you buffer the page output and then later check for redirect condition. That might be too much of a hassle. Remember that headers are the first thing that is sent from the page. Most of the redirect is usually required later in the page. For that you have to buffer all the output of the page and check for redirect condition later. At that point you can either redirect page user header() or simply echo the buffered output.</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">header</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Location: mypage.php'</span>);
<span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, <code>mypage.php</code> is the address of the page to which you would like to redirect the visitors. This address can be absolute and may also include the parameters in this format: <code>mypage.php?param1=val1&amp;m2=val2)</code></p>

<p><strong>Relative/Absolute Path</strong></p>

<p>When dealing with relative or absolute paths, it is ideal to choose an absolute path from the root of the server (DOCUMENT_ROOT). Use the following format:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">header</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Location: /directory/mypage.php'</span>);
<span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>If ever the target page is on another server, you include the full URL:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">header</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Location: http://www.ccm.net/forum/'</span>);
<span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p><strong>HTTP Headers</strong></p>

<p>According to HTTP protocol, HTTP headers must be sent <code>before</code> any type of content. This means that no characters should ever be sent before the header  not even an empty space!</p>

<p><strong>Temporary/Permanent Redirections</strong></p>

<p>By default, the type of redirection presented above is a temporary one. This means that search engines, such as Google Search, will not take the redirection into account when indexing.</p>

<p>If you would like to notify search engines that a page has been permanently moved to another location, use the following code:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?</span>
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">header</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Status: 301 Moved Permanently'</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>, <span class="hljs-number">301</span>);
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">header</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Location: new_address'</span>);
<span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>For example, this page has the following code:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?</span>
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">header</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Status: 301 Moved Permanently'</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>, <span class="hljs-number">301</span>);
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">header</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Location: /pc/imprimante.php3'</span>);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">exit</span>();
<span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>When you click on the link above, you are automatically redirected to this page. Moreover, it is a permanent redirection (Status: 301 Moved Permanently). So, if you type the first URL into Google, you will automatically be redirected to the second, redirected link.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation of PHP Code</strong></p>

<p>The PHP code located after the header() will be interpreted by the server, even if the visitor moves to the address specified in the redirection. In most cases, this means that you need a method to follow the <code>header()</code> function of the <code>exit()</code> function in order to decrease the load of the server:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?</span>
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">header</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Status: 301 Moved Permanently'</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>, <span class="hljs-number">301</span>);
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">header</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Location: address'</span>);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">exit</span>();
<span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In the eve of the semantic web, correctness is something to consider. Unfortunately, PHP's "Location"-header still uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_302" rel="noreferrer">HTTP 302</a>-redirect code, which, strictly, isn't the best one for redirection. The one it should use instead, is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_303" rel="noreferrer">303</a> one.</p>

<p>W3C is kind enough to <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.4" rel="noreferrer">mention</a> that the 303-header is incompatible with "many pre-HTTP/1.1 user agents," which would amount to no browser in current use. So, the 302 is a relic, which <em>shouldn't</em> be used.</p>

<p>Here are my thoughts:</p>

<p>IMHO, the best way to redirect an incoming request would be by using location headers, which goes</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">header</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Location: /index.php"</span>);
<span class="hljs-meta">?&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Once this statement is executed, and output sent out, the browser will begin re-directing the user. However, ensure that there hasn't been any output (any echo / var_dump) before sending headers, else it will lead to errors.</p>

<p>Although this is a quick-and-dirty way to achieve what was originally asked, it would eventually turn out to be an SEO disaster, as this kind of redirect is always interpreted as a 301 / 302 redirect, hence search engines will always see your index page as a re-directed page, and not something of a landing page / main page.</p>

<p>Hence it will affect the SEO settings of the website.</p>

<p>Suppose we want to route from <strong>A.php</strong> file to <strong>B.php</strong> than we have to take help of <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>. Lets see an example</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>

<p>There are multiple ways of doing this, but if youd prefer <code>php</code>, Id recommend the use of the <code>header()</code> function.</p>

<p><strong>Basically</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$your_target_url</span> = www.example.com/index.php;
<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">header</span>(Location : <span class="hljs-variable">$your_target_url</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">exit</span>();
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to kick it up a notch, its best to use it in functions. That way, you are able to add authentications and other checking elemnts in it.</p>

<p>Lets try with by checking the users level.</p>

<p>So, suppose you have stored the users authority level in a session called <code>u_auth</code>.</p>

<p>In the <code>function.php</code></p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">authRedirect</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-variable">$get_auth_level</span>,
                          <span class="hljs-variable">$required_level</span>,
                          <span class="hljs-variable">$if_fail_link</span> = www.example.com/index.php</span>)</span>{
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-variable">$get_auth_level</span> != <span class="hljs-variable">$required_level</span>){
            <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">header</span>(location : <span class="hljs-variable">$if_fail_link</span>);
            <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
            <span class="hljs-keyword">exit</span>();
        }
        <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>{
            <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;
        }
     }

     . . .
</code></pre>

<p>Youll then call the function for every page that you want to authenticate.</p>

<p>Like in <code>page.php</code> or any other page.</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>

    <span class="hljs-comment">// page.php</span>

    <span class="hljs-keyword">require</span> function.php

    <span class="hljs-comment">// Redirects to www.example.com/index.php if the</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// user isnt authentication level 5</span>
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">authRedirect</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$_SESSION</span>[u_auth], <span class="hljs-number">5</span>);

    <span class="hljs-comment">// Redirects to www.example.com/index.php if the</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// user isnt authentication level 4</span>
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">authRedirect</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$_SESSION</span>[u_auth], <span class="hljs-number">4</span>);

    <span class="hljs-comment">// Redirects to www.someotherplace.com/somepage.php if the</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// user isnt authentication level 2</span>
    <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">authRedirect</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$_SESSION</span>[u_auth], <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, www.someotherplace.com/somepage.php);

    . . .
