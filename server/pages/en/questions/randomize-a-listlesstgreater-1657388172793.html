It also relies on a time based seed value by default. A small alleviation of the problem is to seed the Random class with the RNGCryptoServiceProvider or you could use the RNGCryptoServiceProvider in a method similar to this (see below) to generate uniformly chosen random double floating point values but running a lottery pretty much requires understanding randomness and the nature of the randomness source.\n\nvar bytes = new byte[8];\n_secureRng.GetBytes(bytes);\nvar v = BitConverter.ToUInt64(bytes, 0);\nreturn (double)v / ((double)ulong.MaxValue + 1);\n\n\nThe point of generating a random double (between 0 and 1 exclusively) is to use to scale to an integer solution.

<p>The code above uses the much criticised System.Random method to select swap candidates. It's fast but not as random as it should be. If you need a better quality of randomness in your shuffles use the random number generator in System.Security.Cryptography like so:</p>

<pre class="lang-cs s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">using</span> System.Security.Cryptography;

<p>A simple comparison is available <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801085341/http://blog.thijssen.ch/2010/02/when-random-is-too-consistent.html" rel="noreferrer">at this blog</a> (WayBack Machine).</p>

<p>Edit: Since writing this answer a couple years back, many people have commented or written to me, to point out the big silly flaw in my comparison. They are of course right. There's nothing wrong with System.Random if it's used in the way it was intended. In my first example above, I instantiate the rng variable inside of the Shuffle method, which is asking for trouble if the method is going to be called repeatedly. Below is a fixed, full example based on a really useful comment received today from @weston here on SO.</p>

<p>I'm bit surprised by all the clunky versions of this simple algorithm here. Fisher-Yates (or Knuth shuffle) is bit tricky but very compact. Why is it tricky? Because your need to pay attention to whether your random number generator <code>r(a,b)</code> returns value where <code>b</code> is inclusive or exclusive. I've also edited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle#The_modern_algorithm" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia description</a> so people don't blindly follow pseudocode there and create hard to detect bugs. For .Net, <code>Random.Next(a,b)</code> returns number exclusive of <code>b</code> so without further ado, here's how it can be implemented in C#/.Net:</p>

<p>This algorithm can also be implemented by allocating a range from <code>0</code> to <code>length - 1</code> and randomly exhausting the indices by swapping the randomly chosen index with the last index until all indices have been chosen exactly once. This above code accomplishes the exact same thing but without the additional allocation. Which is pretty neat.</p>

<p>With regards to the <code>Random</code> class it's a general purpose number generator (and If I was running a lottery I'd consider using something different). It also relies on a time based seed value by default. A small alleviation of the problem is to seed the <code>Random</code> class with the <code>RNGCryptoServiceProvider</code> or you could use the <code>RNGCryptoServiceProvider</code> in a method similar to this (see below) to generate uniformly chosen random double floating point values but running a lottery pretty much requires understanding randomness and the nature of the randomness source.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The point of generating a random double (between 0 and 1 exclusively) is to use to scale to an integer solution. If you need to pick something from a list based on a random double <code>x</code> that's always going to be <code>0 &lt;= x &amp;&amp; x &lt; 1</code> is straight forward.</p>

<p>Here is an implementation of the Fisher-Yates shuffle that allows specification of the number of elements to return; hence, it is not necessary to first sort the whole collection before taking your desired number of elements.</p>

<p>A very simple approach to this kind of problem is to use a number of random element swap in the list.</p>

<p>In pseudo-code this would look like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-cs s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> 
    r1 = randomPositionInList()
    r2 = randomPositionInList()
    swap elements at index r1 <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> index r2

They are of course right. There\u0026apos;s nothing wrong with System.Random if it\u0026apos;s used in the way it was intended. In my first example above, I instantiate the rng variable inside of the Shuffle method, which is asking for trouble if the method is going to be called repeatedly.
