I know that there are better tools to work with fixed strings instead of patterns, for example awk, perl or python. I would just like to prove whether it is possible or not with sed. I would say let&#x27;s concentrate on basic POSIX regexes to have even more fun! :)

I have tried a lot of things but anytime I could find an input which broke my attempt. I thought keeping it abstract as script to escape would not lead anybody into the wrong direction.

Btw, the discussion came up here. I thought this could be a good place to collect solutions and probably break and/or elaborate them.

In short: for cross-tool use, \\ must be escaped as \\\\ rather than as [\\], which means: instead of the\nsed &apos;s/[^^]/[&amp;]/g; s/\\^/\\\\^/g&apos; command used below, you must use\nsed &apos;s/[^^\\\\]/[&amp;]/g; s/\\^/\\\\^/g; s/\\\\/\\\\\\\\/g&apos;\n\n\n\n\nAll snippets assume bash as the shell (POSIX-compliant reformulations are possible):\n\n\n\nSINGLE-line Solutions\n\nEscaping a string literal for use as a regex in sed:\nTo give credit where credit is due: I found the regex used below in this answer.\nAssuming that the search string is a single-line string:\nsearch=&apos;abc\\n\\t[a-z]\\+\\([^ ]\\)\\{2,3\\}\\3&apos;  # sample input containing metachars.\n\nsearchEscaped=$(sed &apos;s/[^^]/[&amp;]/g; s/\\^/\\\\^/g&apos; &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;$search&quot;) # escape it.\n\nsed -n &quot;s/$searchEscaped/foo/p&quot; &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;$search&quot; # if ok, echoes &apos;foo&apos;\n\n\nEvery character except ^ is placed in its own character set [...] expression to treat it as a literal.\n\nNote that ^ is the one char. you cannot represent as [^], because it has special meaning in that location (negation).\n\n\nThen, ^ chars. are escaped as \\^.\n\nNote that you cannot just escape every char by putting a \\ in front of it because that can turn a literal char into a metachar, e.g. \\&lt; and \\b are word boundaries in some tools, \\n is a newline, \\{ is the start of a RE interval like \\{1,3\\}, etc.\n\n\n\nThe approach is robust, but not efficient.\nThe robustness comes from not trying to anticipate all special regex characters - which will vary across regex dialects - but to focus on only 2 features shared by all regex dialects:\n\nthe ability to specify literal characters inside a character set.\nthe ability to escape a literal  ^ as \\^\n\n\nEscaping a string literal for use as the replacement string in sed&apos;s s/// command:\nThe replacement string in a sed s/// command is not a regex, but it recognizes placeholders that refer to either the entire string matched by the regex (&amp;) or specific capture-group results by index (\\1, \\2, ...), so these must be escaped, along with the (customary) regex delimiter, /.\nAssuming that the replacement string is a single-line string:\nreplace=&apos;Laurel &amp; Hardy; PS\\2&apos; # sample input containing metachars.\n\nreplaceEscaped=$(sed &apos;s/[&amp;/\\]/\\\\&amp;/g&apos; &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;$replace&quot;) # escape it\n\nsed -n &quot;s/\\(.*\\) \\(.*\\)/$replaceEscaped/p&quot; &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;foo bar&quot; # if ok, outputs $replace as is\n\n\n\nMULTI-line Solutions\n\nEscaping a MULTI-LINE string literal for use as a regex in sed:\nNote: This only makes sense if multiple input lines (possibly ALL) have been read before attempting to match.\nSince tools such as sed and awk operate on a single line at a time by default, extra steps are needed to make them read more than one line at a time.\n# Define sample multi-line literal.\nsearch=&apos;/abc\\n\\t[a-z]\\+\\([^ ]\\)\\{2,3\\}\\3\n/def\\n\\t[A-Z]\\+\\([^ ]\\)\\{3,4\\}\\4&apos;\n\n# Escape it.\nsearchEscaped=$(sed -e &apos;s/[^^]/[&amp;]/g; s/\\^/\\\\^/g; $!a\\&apos;$&apos;\\n&apos;&apos;\\\\n&apos; &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;$search&quot; | tr -d &apos;\\n&apos;)           #&apos;\n\n# Use in a Sed command that reads ALL input lines up front.\n# If ok, echoes &apos;foo&apos;\nsed -n -e &apos;:a&apos; -e &apos;$!{N;ba&apos; -e &apos;}&apos; -e &quot;s/$searchEscaped/foo/p&quot; &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;$search&quot;\n\n\nThe newlines in multi-line input strings must be translated to &apos;\\n&apos; strings, which is how newlines are encoded in a regex.\n$!a\\&apos;$&apos;\\n&apos;&apos;\\\\n&apos; appends string &apos;\\n&apos; to every output line but the last (the last newline is ignored, because it was added by &lt;&lt;&lt;)\ntr -d &apos;\\n then removes all actual newlines from the string (sed adds one whenever it prints its pattern space), effectively replacing all newlines in the input with &apos;\\n&apos; strings.\n\n\n\n-e &apos;:a&apos; -e &apos;$!{N;ba&apos; -e &apos;}&apos; is the POSIX-compliant form of a sed idiom that reads all input lines a loop, therefore leaving subsequent commands to operate on all input lines at once.\n\nIf you&apos;re using GNU sed (only), you can use its -z option to simplify reading all input lines at once:\nsed -z &quot;s/$searchEscaped/foo/&quot; &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;$search&quot;\n\n\n\n\nEscaping a MULTI-LINE string literal for use as the replacement string in sed&apos;s s/// command:\n# Define sample multi-line literal.\nreplace=&apos;Laurel &amp; Hardy; PS\\2\nMasters\\1 &amp; Johnson\\2&apos;\n\n# Escape it for use as a Sed replacement string.\nIFS= read -d &apos;&apos; -r &lt; &lt;(sed -e &apos;:a&apos; -e &apos;$!{N;ba&apos; -e &apos;}&apos;

&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;foo bar&quot; \n\n\nNewlines in the input string must be retained as actual newlines, but \\-escaped.\n-e &apos;:a&apos; -e &apos;$!{N;ba&apos; -e &apos;}&apos; is the POSIX-compliant form of a sed idiom that reads all input lines a loop.\n&apos;s/[&amp;/\\]/\\\\&amp;/g escapes all &amp;, \\ and / instances, as in the single-line solution.\ns/\\n/\\\\&amp;/g&apos; then \\-prefixes all actual newlines.\nIFS= read -d &apos;&apos; -r is used to read the sed command&apos;s output as is (to avoid the automatic removal of trailing newlines that a command substitution ($(...)) would perform).\n${REPLY%$&apos;\\n&apos;} then removes a single trailing newline, which the &lt;&lt;&lt; has implicitly appended to the input.\n\n\n\nbash functions based on the above (for sed):\n\nquoteRe() quotes (escapes) for use in a regex\nquoteSubst() quotes for use in the substitution string of a s/// call.\nboth handle multi-line input correctly\n\nNote that because sed reads a single line at at time by default, use of quoteRe() with multi-line strings only makes sense in sed commands that explicitly read multiple (or all) lines at once.\nAlso, using command substitutions ($(...)) to call the functions won&apos;t work for strings that have trailing newlines; in that event, use something like IFS= read -d &apos;&apos; -r escapedValue &lt;(quoteSubst &quot;$value&quot;)\n\n\n\n# SYNOPSIS\n#   quoteRe &lt;text&gt;\nquoteRe() { sed -e &apos;s/[^^]/[&amp;]/g; s/\\^/\\\\^/g; $!a\\&apos;$&apos;\\n&apos;&apos;\\\\n&apos; &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;$1&quot; | tr -d &apos;\\n&apos;; }\n\n\n# SYNOPSIS\n#  quoteSubst &lt;text&gt;\nquoteSubst() {\n  IFS= read -d &apos;&apos; -r &lt; &lt;(sed -e &apos;:a&apos; -e &apos;$!{N;ba&apos; -e &apos;}&apos; -e &apos;s/[&amp;/\\]/\\\\&amp;/g; s/\\n/\\\\&amp;/g&apos; &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;$1&quot;)\n  printf %s &quot;${REPLY%$&apos;\\n&apos;}&quot;\n}\n\nExample:\nfrom=$&apos;Cost\\(*):\\n$3.&apos; # sample input containing metachars. \nto=&apos;You &amp; I&apos;$&apos;\\n&apos;&apos;eating A\\1 sauce.&apos; # sample replacement string with metachars.\n\n# Should print the unmodified value of $to\nsed -e &apos;:a&apos;

-e &apos;}&apos; to read all input at once, so that the multi-line substitution works.\n\n\nperl solution:\nPerl has built-in support for escaping arbitrary strings for literal use in a regex: the quotemeta() function or its equivalent \\Q...\\E quoting.\nThe approach is the same for both single- and multi-line strings; for example:\nfrom=$&apos;Cost\\(*):\\n$3.&apos; # sample input containing metachars.\nto=&apos;You owe me $1/$&amp; for&apos;$&apos;\\n&apos;&apos;eating A\\1 sauce.&apos; # sample replacement string w/ metachars.\n\n# Should print the unmodified value of $to.\n# Note that the replacement value needs NO escaping.\nperl -s -0777 -pe &apos;s/\\Q$from\\E/$to/&apos; -- -from=&quot;$from&quot; -to=&quot;$to&quot; &lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;$from&quot; \n\n\nNote the use of -0777 to read all input at once, so that the multi-line substitution works.\n\nThe -s option allows placing -&lt;var&gt;=&lt;val&gt;-style Perl variable definitions following -- after the script, before any filename operands.\n\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Building upon @mklement0&apos;s answer in this thread, the following tool will replace any single-line string (as opposed to regexp) with any other single-line string using sed and bash:\n$ cat sedstr\n#!/bin/bash\nold=&quot;$1&quot;\nnew=&quot;$2&quot;\nfile=&quot;${3:--}&quot;\nescOld=$(sed &apos;s/[^^\\\\]/[&amp;]/g;

&apos;d&amp;e\\1f&apos; file  \nd&amp;e\\1f\naxx/bb\\nc\n\nThe reason this is useful is that it can be easily augmented to use word-delimiters to replace words if necessary, e.g. in GNU sed syntax:\nsed &quot;s/\\&lt;$escOld\\&gt;/$escNew/g&quot; &quot;$file&quot;\n\nwhereas the tools that actually operate on strings (e.g. awk&apos;s index()) cannot use word-delimiters.\nNOTE: the reason to not wrap \\ in a bracket expression is that if you were using a tool that accepts [\\]] as a literal ] inside a bracket expression (e.g. perl and most awk implementations) to do the actual final substitution (i.e. instead of sed &quot;s/$escOld/$escNew/g&quot;) then you couldn&apos;t use the approach of:\nsed &apos;s/[^^]/[&amp;]/g; s/\\^/\\\\^/g&apos;\n\nto escape \\ by enclosing it in [] because then \\x would become [\\][x] which means \\ or ] or [ or x. Instead you&apos;d need:\nsed &apos;s/[^^\\\\]/[&amp;]/g; s/\\^/\\\\^/g; s/\\\\/\\\\\\\\/g&apos;\n\nSo while [\\] is probably OK for all current sed implementations, we know that \\\\ will work for

<p>I know that there are better tools to work with fixed strings instead of patterns, for example <code>awk</code>, <code>perl</code> or <code>python</code>. I would just like to prove whether it is possible or not with <code>sed</code>. I would say let's concentrate on basic POSIX regexes to have even more fun! :)</p>

<p>I have tried a lot of things but anytime I could find an input which broke my attempt. I thought keeping it abstract as <code>script to escape</code> would not lead anybody into the wrong direction.</p>

<p>Btw, the discussion came up <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29606527/sed-replace-multiple-patterns-but-not-with-the-same-string/29609706?noredirect=1#comment47365660_29609706">here</a>. I thought this could be a good place to collect solutions and probably break and/or elaborate them.</p>

<h3>Escaping a string literal for use as a <em>regex</em> in <code>sed</code>:</h3>
<p><sup>To give credit where credit is due: I found the regex used below in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/28783790/45375">this answer</a>.</sup></p>
<p>Assuming that the search string is a <em>single</em>-line string:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash">search=<span class="hljs-string">'abc\n\t[a-z]\+\([^ ]\)\{2,3\}\3'</span>  <span class="hljs-comment"># sample input containing metachars.</span>

</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Every character except <code>^</code> is placed in its own character set <code>[...]</code> expression to treat it as a literal.
<ul>
<li>Note that <code>^</code> is the one char. you <em>cannot</em> represent as <code>[^]</code>, because it has special meaning in that location (negation).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then, <code>^</code> chars. are escaped as <code>\^</code>.
<ul>
<li>Note that you cannot just escape every char by putting a <code>\</code> in front of it because that can turn a literal char into a metachar, e.g. <code>\&lt;</code> and <code>\b</code> are word boundaries in some tools, <code>\n</code> is a newline, <code>\{</code> is the start of a RE interval like <code>\{1,3\}</code>, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The approach is robust, but not efficient.</p>
<p>The <strong>robustness comes from <em>not</em> trying to anticipate all special regex characters</strong> - which will vary across regex dialects - but to <strong>focus on only 2 features <em>shared by all regex dialects</em></strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ability to specify literal characters inside a character set.</li>
<li>the ability to escape a literal  <code>^</code> as <code>\^</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Escaping a string literal for use as the <em>replacement string</em> in <code>sed</code>'s <code>s///</code> command:</h3>
<p>The replacement string in a <code>sed</code> <code>s///</code> command is not a regex, but it recognizes <em>placeholders</em> that refer to either the entire string matched by the regex (<code>&amp;</code>) or specific capture-group results by index (<code>\1</code>, <code>\2</code>, ...), so these must be escaped, along with the (customary) regex delimiter, <code>/</code>.</p>
<p>Assuming that the replacement string is a <em>single</em>-line string:</p>

<p>Building upon <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/29613573/1745001">@mklement0's answer</a> in this thread, the following tool will replace any single-line string (as opposed to regexp) with any other single-line string using <code>sed</code> and <code>bash</code>:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash">$ <span class="hljs-built_in">cat</span> sedstr
<span class="hljs-comment">#!/bin/bash</span>
old=<span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-variable">$1</span>"</span>
new=<span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-variable">$2</span>"</span>
file=<span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-variable">${3:--}</span>"</span>
escOld=$(sed <span class="hljs-string">'s/[^^\\]/[&amp;]/g; s/\^/\\^/g; s/\\/\\\\/g'</span> &lt;&lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-variable">$old</span>"</span>)
escNew=$(sed <span class="hljs-string">'s/[&amp;/\]/\\&amp;/g'</span> &lt;&lt;&lt; <span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-variable">$new</span>"</span>)
sed <span class="hljs-string">"s/<span class="hljs-variable">$escOld</span>/<span class="hljs-variable">$escNew</span>/g"</span> <span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-variable">$file</span>"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>To illustrate the need for this tool, consider trying to replace <code>a.*/b{2,}\nc</code> with <code>d&amp;e\1f</code> by calling <code>sed</code> directly:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash">$ <span class="hljs-built_in">cat</span> file
a.*/b{2,}\nc
axx/bb\nc

$ sed <span class="hljs-string">'s/a.*/b{2,}\nc/d&amp;e\1f/'</span> file  
sed: -e expression <span class="hljs-comment">#1, char 16: unknown option to `s'</span>
$ sed <span class="hljs-string">'s/a.*\/b{2,}\nc/d&amp;e\1f/'</span> file
sed: -e expression <span class="hljs-comment">#1, char 23: invalid reference \1 on `s' command's RHS</span>
$ sed <span class="hljs-string">'s/a.*\/b{2,}\nc/d&amp;e\\1f/'</span> file
a.*/b{2,}\nc
axx/bb\nc
<span class="hljs-comment"># .... and so on, peeling the onion ad nauseum until:</span>
$ sed <span class="hljs-string">'s/a\.\*\/b{2,}\\nc/d\&amp;e\\1f/'</span> file
d&amp;e\1f
axx/bb\nc
</code></pre>
<p>or use the above tool:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash">$ sedstr <span class="hljs-string">'a.*/b{2,}\nc'</span> <span class="hljs-string">'d&amp;e\1f'</span> file  
d&amp;e\1f
axx/bb\nc
</code></pre>
<p>The reason this is useful is that it can be easily augmented to use word-delimiters to replace words if necessary, e.g. in GNU <code>sed</code> syntax:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash">sed <span class="hljs-string">"s/\&lt;<span class="hljs-variable">$escOld</span>\&gt;/<span class="hljs-variable">$escNew</span>/g"</span> <span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-variable">$file</span>"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>whereas the tools that actually operate on strings (e.g. <code>awk</code>'s <code>index()</code>) cannot use word-delimiters.</p>
<p>NOTE: the reason to not wrap <code>\</code> in a bracket expression is that if you were using a tool that accepts <code>[\]]</code> as a literal <code>]</code> inside a bracket expression (e.g. perl and most awk implementations) to do the actual final substitution (i.e. instead of <code>sed "s/$escOld/$escNew/g"</code>) then you couldn't use the approach of:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash">sed <span class="hljs-string">'s/[^^]/[&amp;]/g; s/\^/\\^/g'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>to escape <code>\</code> by enclosing it in <code>[]</code> because then <code>\x</code> would become <code>[\][x]</code> which means <code>\ or ] or [ or x</code>. Instead you'd need:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash">sed <span class="hljs-string">'s/[^^\\]/[&amp;]/g; s/\^/\\^/g; s/\\/\\\\/g'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>So while <code>[\]</code> is probably OK for all current sed implementations, we know that <code>\\</code> will work for all sed, awk, perl, etc. implementations and so use that form of escaping.</p>
