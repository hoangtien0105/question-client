Further explanation follows.\n\n\nExplanation\nSource Tables\n\nFirst start with a CROSS JOIN (AKA Cartesian Product). This does not have an ON clause and simply returns every combination of rows from the two tables.\nSELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A CROSS JOIN B\n\nInner and Outer joins have an &quot;ON&quot; clause predicate.\n\nInner Join. Evaluate the condition in the &quot;ON&quot; clause for all rows in the cross join result. If true return the joined row. Otherwise discard it.\nLeft Outer Join. Same as inner join then for any rows in the left table that did not match anything output these with NULL values for the right table columns.\nRight Outer Join. Same as inner join then for any rows in the right table that did not  match anything output these with NULL values for the left table columns.\nFull Outer Join. Same as inner join then preserve left non matched rows as in left outer join and right non matching rows as per right outer join.\n\nSome examples\nSELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour\nThe above is the classic equi join.\n\nAnimated Version\n\nSELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.Colour NOT IN (&apos;Green&apos;,&apos;Blue&apos;)\nThe inner join condition need not necessarily be an equality condition and it need not reference columns from both (or even either) of the tables. Evaluating A.Colour NOT IN (&apos;Green&apos;,&apos;Blue&apos;) on each row of the cross join returns.\n\nSELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A INNER JOIN B ON 1 =1\nThe join condition evaluates to true for all rows in the cross join result so this is just the same as a cross join. I won&apos;t repeat the picture of the 16 rows again.\nSELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour\nOuter Joins are logically evaluated in the same way as inner joins except that if a row from the left table (for a left join) does not join with any rows from the right hand table at all it is preserved in the result with NULL values for the right hand columns.\n\nSELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour WHERE B.Colour IS NULL\nThis simply restricts the previous result to only return the rows where B.Colour IS NULL. In this particular case these will be the rows that were preserved as they had no match in the right hand table and the query returns the single red row not matched in table B. This is known as an anti semi join.\nIt is important to select a column for the IS NULL test that is either not nullable or for which the join condition ensures that any NULL values will be excluded in order for this pattern to work correctly and avoid just bringing back rows which happen to have a NULL value for that column in addition to the un matched rows.\n\nSELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A RIGHT OUTER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour\nRight outer joins act similarly to left outer joins except they preserve non matching rows from the right table and null extend the left hand columns.\n\nSELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A FULL OUTER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour\nFull outer joins combine the behaviour of left and right joins and preserve the non matching rows from both the left and the right tables.\n\nSELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A FULL OUTER JOIN B ON 1 = 0\nNo rows in the cross join match the 1=0 predicate. All rows from both sides are preserved using normal outer join rules with NULL in the columns from the table on the other side.\n\nSELECT COALESCE(A.Colour, B.Colour) AS Colour FROM A FULL OUTER JOIN B ON 1 = 0\nWith a minor amend to the preceding query one could simulate a UNION ALL of the two tables.\n\nSELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour WHERE B.Colour = &apos;Green&apos;\nNote that the WHERE clause (if present) logically runs after the join. One common error is to perform a left outer join and then include a WHERE clause with a condition on the right table that ends up excluding the non matching rows. The above ends up performing the outer join...\n\n... And then the &quot;Where&quot; clause runs. NULL= &apos;Green&apos; does not evaluate to true so the row preserved by the outer join ends up discarded (along with the blue one) effectively converting the join back to an inner one.\n\nIf the intention was to include only rows from B where Colour is Green and all rows from A regardless the correct syntax would be\nSELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour AND B.Colour = &apos;Green&apos;\n\nSQL Fiddle\nSee these examples run live at SQLFiddle.com.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Joins are used to combine the data from two tables, with the result being a new, temporary table. Joins are performed based on something called a predicate, which specifies the condition to use in order to perform a join.  The difference between an inner join and an outer join is that an inner join will return only the rows that actually match based on the join predicate.\nFor eg- Lets consider Employee and Location table:\nEmployee\n\n\n\n\nEmpID\nEmpName\n\n\n\n\n13\nJason\n\n\n8\nAlex\n\n\n3\nRam\n\n\n17\nBabu\n\n\n25\nJohnson\n\n\n\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nEmpID\nEmpLoc\n\n\n\n\n13\nSan Jose\n\n\n8\nLos Angeles\n\n\n3\nPune, India\n\n\n17\nChennai, India\n\n\n39\nBangalore, India\n\n\n\n\nInner Join:-\nInner join creates a new result table by combining column values of two tables (Employee and Location) based upon the join-predicate. The query compares each row of Employee with each row of Location to find all pairs of rows which satisfy the join-predicate. When the join-predicate is satisfied by matching non-NULL values, column values for each matched pair of rows of Employee and Location are combined into a result row.\nHeres what the SQL for an inner join will look like:\nselect  * from employee inner join location on employee.empID = location.empID\nOR\nselect  * from employee, location where employee.empID = location.empID\n\nNow, here is what the result of running that SQL would look like:\n\n\n\n\nEmployee.EmpId\nEmployee.EmpName\nLocation.EmpId\nLocation.EmpLoc\n\n\n\n\n13\nJason\n13\nSan Jose\n\n\n8\nAlex\n8\nLos Angeles\n\n\n3\nRam\n3\nPune, India\n\n\n17\nBabu\n17\nChennai, India\n\n\n\n\nOuter Join:-\nAn outer join does not require each record in the two joined tables to have a matching record. The joined table retains each recordeven if no other matching record exists. Outer joins subdivide further into left outer joins and right outer joins, depending on which table&apos;s rows are retained (left or right).\nLeft Outer Join:-\nThe result of a left outer join (or simply left join) for tables Employee and Location always contains all records of the &quot;left&quot; table (Employee), even if the join-condition does not find any matching record in the &quot;right&quot; table (Location).\nHere is what the SQL for a left outer join would look like, using the tables above:\nselect  * from employee left outer join location on employee.empID = location.empID;\n//Use of outer keyword is optional\n\nNow, here is what the result of running this SQL would look like:\n\n\n\n\nEmployee.EmpId\nEmployee.EmpName\nLocation.EmpId\nLocation.EmpLoc\n\n\n\n\n13\nJason\n13\nSan Jose\n\n\n8\nAlex\n8\nLos Angeles\n\n\n3\nRam\n3\nPune, India\n\n\n17\nBabu\n17\nChennai, India\n\n\n25\nJohnson\nNULL\nNULL\n\n\n\n\nNote how while Johnson has no entry in the employee location table, he is still included in the results but the location fields are nulled.\nRight Outer Join:-\nA right outer join (or right join) closely resembles a left outer join, except with the treatment of the tables reversed. Every row from the &quot;right&quot; table (Location) will appear in the joined table at least once. If no matching row from the &quot;left&quot; table (Employee) exists, NULL will appear in columns from Employee for those records that have no match in Location.\nThis is what the SQL looks like:\nselect * from employee right outer join location  on employee.empID = location.empID;\n//Use of outer keyword is optional\n\nUsing the tables above, we can show what the result set of a right outer join would look like:\n\n\n\n\nEmployee.EmpId\nEmployee.EmpName\nLocation.EmpId\nLocation.EmpLoc\n\n\n\n\n13\nJason\n13\nSan Jose\n\n\n8\nAlex\n8\nLos Angeles\n\n\n3\nRam\n3\nPune, India\n\n\n17\nBabu\n17\nChennai, India\n\n\nNULL\nNULL\n39\nBangalore, India\n\n\n\n\nNote how while there are no employees listed as working in Bangalore, it is still included in the results with the employee fields nulled out.\nFull Outer Joins:-\nFull Outer Join or Full Join is to retain the nonmatching information by including nonmatching rows in the results of a join, use a full outer join.

It&apos;s omitted.\nINNER JOIN\nINNER JOIN becomes a cartesian products. It&apos;s the same as The General Idea/CROSS JOIN:\nSELECT *\n  FROM citizen    c\n  JOIN postalcode p ON 1 = 1  -- &lt; -- The ON condition makes it a CROSS JOIN\n\nThis is where the inner join can really be seen as the cross join with results not matching the condition removed. Here none of the resulting rows are removed.\nUsing INNER JOIN to get the result of a LEFT OUTER JOIN also requires tricks. It&apos;s omitted.\nLEFT OUTER JOIN\nLEFT JOIN results in rows as The General Idea/CROSS JOIN:\nSELECT *\n  FROM citizen         c\n  LEFT JOIN postalcode p ON 1 = 1 -- &lt; -- The ON condition makes it a CROSS JOIN\n\nLEFT JOIN results in rows as The General Idea/INNER JOIN:\nSELECT *\n  FROM citizen         c\n  LEFT JOIN postalcode p ON c.postal = p.postal\n WHERE p.postal IS NOT NULL -- &lt; -- removed the row where there&apos;s no mathcing result from postalcode\n\n\nThe troubles with the Venn diagram\nAn image internet search on &quot;sql join cross inner outer&quot; will show a multitude of Venn diagrams. I used to have a printed copy of one on my desk. But there are issues with the representation.\nVenn diagram are excellent for set theory, where an element can be in one or both sets. But for databases, an element in one &quot;set&quot; seem, to me, to be a row in a table, and therefore not also present in any other tables. There is no such thing as one row present in multiple tables. A row is unique to the table.\nSelf joins are a corner case where each element is in fact the same in both sets. But it&apos;s still not free of any of the issues below.\nThe set A represents the set on the left (the citizen table) and the set B is the set on the right (the postalcode table) in below discussion.\nCROSS JOIN\nEvery element in both sets are matched with every element in the other set, meaning we need A amount of every B elements and B amount of every A elements to properly represent this Cartesian product. Set theory isn&apos;t made for multiple identical elements in a set, so I find Venn diagrams to properly represent it impractical/impossible. It doesn&apos;t seem that UNION fits at all.\nThe rows are distinct. The UNION is 7 rows in total. But they&apos;re incompatible for a common SQL results set. And this is not how a CROSS JOIN works at all:\n\nTrying to represent it like this:\n\n..but now it just looks like an INTERSECTION, which it&apos;s certainly not. Furthermore there&apos;s no element in the INTERSECTION that is actually in any of the two distinct sets. However, it looks very much like the searchable results similar to this:\n\nFor reference one searchable result for CROSS JOINs can be seen at Tutorialgateway. The INTERSECTION, just like this one, is empty.\nINNER JOIN\nThe value of an element depends on the JOIN condition. It&apos;s possible to represent this under the condition that every row becomes unique to that condition. Meaning id=x is only true for one row. Once a row in table A (citizen) matches multiple rows in table B (postalcode) under the JOIN condition, the result has the same problems as the CROSS JOIN: The row needs to be represented multiple times, and the set theory isn&apos;t really made for that. Under the condition of uniqueness, the diagram could work though, but keep in mind that the JOIN condition determines the placement of an element in the diagram. Looking only at the values of the JOIN condition with the rest of the row just along for the ride:\n\nThis representation falls completely apart when using an INNER JOIN with a ON 1 = 1 condition making it into a CROSS JOIN.\nWith a self-JOIN, the rows are in fact idential elements in both tables, but representing the tables as both A and B isn&apos;t very suitable. For example a common self-JOIN condition that makes an element in A to be matching a different element in B is ON A.parent = B.child, making the match from A to B on seperate elements. From the examples that would be a SQL like this:\nSELECT *\n  FROM citizen c1\n  JOIN citizen c2 ON c1.id = c2.leader\n\n\nMeaning Smith is the leader of both Green and Jensen.\nOUTER JOIN\nAgain the troubles begin when one row has multiple matches to rows in the other table. This is further complicated because the OUTER JOIN can be though of as to match the empty set. But in set theory the union of any set C and an empty set, is always just C. The empty set adds nothing. The representation of this LEFT OUTER JOIN is usually just showing all of A to illustrate that rows in A are selected regardless of whether there is a match or not from B. The &quot;matching elements&quot; however has the same problems as the illustration above. They depend on the condition. And the empty set seems to have wandered over to A:\n\nWHERE clause - making sense\nFinding all rows from a CROSS JOIN with Smith and postalcode on the Moon:\nSELECT *\n  FROM citizen          c\n CROSS JOIN postalcode  p\n WHERE c.name = &apos;Smith&apos;\n   AND p.area = &apos;Moon&apos;;\n\n\nNow the Venn diagram isn&apos;t used to reflect the JOIN. It&apos;s used only for the WHERE clause:\n\n..and that makes sense.\nWhen INTERSECT and UNION makes sense\nINTERSECT\nAs explained an INNER JOIN is not really an INTERSECT. However INTERSECTs can be used on results of seperate queries. Here a Venn diagram makes sense, because the elements from the seperate queries are in fact rows that either belonging to just one of the results or both. Intersect will obviously only return results where the row is present in both queries. This SQL will result in the same row as the one above WHERE, and the Venn diagram will also be the same:\nSELECT *\n  FROM citizen          c\n CROSS JOIN postalcode  p\n WHERE c.name = &apos;Smith&apos;\nINTERSECT\nSELECT *\n  FROM citizen          c\n CROSS JOIN postalcode  p\n WHERE p.area = &apos;Moon&apos;;\n\nUNION\nAn OUTER JOIN is not a UNION. However UNION work under the same conditions as INTERSECT, resulting in a return of all results combining both SELECTs:\nSELECT *\n  FROM citizen          c\n CROSS JOIN postalcode  p\n WHERE c.name = &apos;Smith&apos;\nUNION\nSELECT *\n  FROM citizen          c\n CROSS JOIN postalcode  p\n WHERE p.area = &apos;Moon&apos;;\n\nwhich is equivalent to:\nSELECT *\n  FROM citizen          c\n CROSS JOIN postalcode  p\n WHERE c.name = &apos;Smith&apos;\n   OR p.area = &apos;Moon&apos;;\n\n..and gives the result:\n\nAlso here a Venn diagram makes sense:\n\nWhen it doesn&apos;t apply\nAn important note is that these only work when the structure of the results from the two SELECT&apos;s are the same, enabling a comparison or union. The results of these two will not enable that:\nSELECT *\n  FROM citizen\n WHERE name = &apos;Smith&apos;\n\nSELECT *\n  FROM postalcode\n WHERE area = &apos;Moon&apos;;\n\n..trying to combine the results with UNION gives a\nORA-01790: expression must have same datatype as corresponding expression\n\n\nFor further interest read Say NO to Venn Diagrams When Explaining JOINs and sql joins as venn diagram.

OUTER JOIN\nIn SQL, join is used to compare and combine  literally, join  and return specific rows of data from two or more tables in a database. INNER JOIN finds and returns matching data from a table, while OUTER JOIN finds and returns matching data and some different data from a table.\n\nINNER JOIN\nINNER JOIN focuses on similarity between 2 tables. When using INNER JOIN, there must be at least some matching data between the two (or more) tables being compared. INNER JOIN searches tables for matching or overlapping data. If found, INNER JOIN combines the information and returns it in a new table.\nExample\nLet&apos;s consider a common scenario with two tables: product price and quantity. The common information in both tables is the product name, so this is the logical column of the join table. Some products are the same in both tables; others are unique to one and have no matches in the other.\nA product INNER JOIN only returns information about products that are common to both tables.\nI&apos;ve put together a little interaction of HTML and CSS so that you can imagine the whole thing visually.\n\n\n/* CSS styles */\n.circles {\n  display: flex;\n}\n\n.circle {\n  height: 100px;\n  width: 100px;\n  border-radius: 50%;\n  background: #99AEBA;\n}\n\n.circle:first-child {\n  background: #FF0000;\n}\n\n.circle:nth-child(2) {\n  background: #05E156;\n  transform: translateX(-45px);\n  z-index: 2;\n  mix-blend-mode: multiply;\n}\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;INNER JOIN&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;circles&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;div class=&quot;circle&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=&quot;circle&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\nHere the red circle describes your PRICES and the green circle your QUANTITIES.\n\n\n\n\nPRICES\nQUANTITIES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP.Product\nP.Prices\nQ.Product\nQ.Quantity\n\n\n\n\nA\n6\nA\n92\n\n\nB\n5\nB\n27\n\n\nC\n5\nD\n66\n\n\nD\n1\nE\n20\n\n\n\n\nIf you now want an INNER JOIN where the intersection is determined you can write the following query:\nSELECT Prices.*, Quantities.Quantity\nFROM Prices INNER JOIN Quantities\nON Prices.Product = Quantities.Product;\n\nAs intersection you now get the black area from the diagram and the following query result comes out:\n\n\n\n\nProduct\nPrice\nQuantity\n\n\n\n\nA\n6\n92\n\n\nB\n5\n27\n\n\nD\n1\n66\n\n\n\n\nOUTER JOIN\nAn OUTER JOIN returns a set of records (or rows) that contain what the INNER JOIN would return, but also contain additional rows for which no corresponding match was found in another table.\nThere are three types of outer joins:\n\nLEFT OUTER JOIN (or left join)\nRIGHT OUTER JOIN (or right join)\nFULL OUTER JOIN (or full join)\n\nEach of these OUTER JOIN refers to the portion of data that is being compared, combined, and returned.

<p>Assuming you're joining on columns with no duplicates, which is a very common case:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An inner join of A and B gives the result of A intersect B, i.e. the inner part of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram" rel="noreferrer">Venn diagram</a> intersection.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An outer join of A and B gives the results of A union B, i.e. the outer parts of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram" rel="noreferrer">Venn diagram</a> union.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you have two tables, with a single column each, and data as follows:</p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">A    B
<span class="hljs-operator">-</span>    <span class="hljs-operator">-</span>

<span class="hljs-number">3</span>    <span class="hljs-number">5</span>
<span class="hljs-number">4</span>    <span class="hljs-number">6</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Note that (1,2) are unique to A, (3,4) are common, and (5,6) are unique to B.</p>
<p><strong>Inner join</strong></p>
<p>An inner join using either of the equivalent queries gives the intersection of the two tables, i.e. the two rows they have in common.</p>

<p>The Venn diagrams don't really do it for me.</p>
<p>They don't show any distinction between a cross join and an inner join, for example, or more generally show any distinction between different types of join predicate or provide a framework for reasoning about how they will operate.</p>
<p>There is no substitute for understanding the logical processing and it is relatively straightforward to grasp anyway.</p>
<ol>
<li>Imagine a cross join.</li>
<li>Evaluate the <code>on</code> clause against all rows from step 1 keeping those where the predicate evaluates to <code>true</code></li>
<li>(For outer joins only) add back in any outer rows that were lost in step 2.</li>

<p>(NB: In practice the query optimiser may find more efficient ways of executing the query than the purely logical description above but the final result must be the same)</p>
<p>I'll start off with an animated version of a <strong>full outer join</strong>. Further explanation follows.</p>

<h1>Explanation</h1>
<p><strong>Source Tables</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LVYKx.png" alt="enter link description here"></p>
<p>First start with a <code>CROSS JOIN</code> (AKA Cartesian Product). This does not have an <code>ON</code> clause and simply returns every combination of rows from the two tables.</p>
<p><strong>SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A CROSS JOIN B</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/cv3t6.png" alt="enter link description here"></p>
<p>Inner and Outer joins have an "ON" clause predicate.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inner Join.</strong> Evaluate the condition in the "ON" clause for all rows in the cross join result. If true return the joined row. Otherwise discard it.</li>
<li><strong>Left Outer Join.</strong> Same as inner join then for any rows in the left table that did not match anything output these with NULL values for the right table columns.</li>
<li><strong>Right Outer Join.</strong> Same as inner join then for any rows in the right table that did not  match anything output these with NULL values for the left table columns.</li>
<li><strong>Full Outer Join.</strong> Same as inner join then preserve left non matched rows as in left outer join and right non matching rows as per right outer join.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Some examples</h1>
<p><strong>SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour</strong></p>
<p>The above is the classic equi join.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kZcvR.gif" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/kZcvR.gif" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
<h3>SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.Colour NOT IN ('Green','Blue')</h3>
<p>The inner join condition need not necessarily be an equality condition and it need not reference columns from both (or even either) of the tables. Evaluating <code>A.Colour NOT IN ('Green','Blue')</code> on each row of the cross join returns.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZwoCi.png" alt="inner 2"></p>
<p><strong>SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A INNER JOIN B ON 1 =1</strong></p>
<p>The join condition evaluates to true for all rows in the cross join result so this is just the same as a cross join. I won't repeat the picture of the 16 rows again.</p>
<h3>SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour</h3>
<p>Outer Joins are logically evaluated in the same way as inner joins except that if a row from the left table (for a left join) does not join with any rows from the right hand table at all it is preserved in the result with <code>NULL</code> values for the right hand columns.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4bzv2.png" alt="LOJ"></p>
<h3>SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour WHERE B.Colour IS NULL</h3>
<p>This simply restricts the previous result to only return the rows where <code>B.Colour IS NULL</code>. In this particular case these will be the rows that were preserved as they had no match in the right hand table and the query returns the single red row not matched in table <code>B</code>. This is known as an anti semi join.</p>
<p>It is important to select a column for the <code>IS NULL</code> test that is either not nullable or for which the join condition ensures that any <code>NULL</code> values will be excluded in order for this pattern to work correctly and avoid just bringing back rows which happen to have a <code>NULL</code> value for that column in addition to the un matched rows.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/d6CVF.png" alt="loj is null"></p>
<h3>SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A RIGHT OUTER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour</h3>
<p>Right outer joins act similarly to left outer joins except they preserve non matching rows from the right table and null extend the left hand columns.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LIOW4.png" alt="ROJ"></p>
<h3>SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A FULL OUTER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour</h3>
<p>Full outer joins combine the behaviour of left and right joins and preserve the non matching rows from both the left and the right tables.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/iVoqu.png" alt="FOJ"></p>
<h3>SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A FULL OUTER JOIN B ON 1 = 0</h3>
<p>No rows in the cross join match the <code>1=0</code> predicate. All rows from both sides are preserved using normal outer join rules with NULL in the columns from the table on the other side.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gtIhf.png" alt="FOJ 2"></p>
<h3>SELECT COALESCE(A.Colour, B.Colour) AS Colour FROM A FULL OUTER JOIN B ON 1 = 0</h3>
<p>With a minor amend to the preceding query one could simulate a <code>UNION ALL</code> of the two tables.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/WPu9W.png" alt="UNION ALL"></p>
<h3>SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour WHERE B.Colour = 'Green'</h3>
<p>Note that the <code>WHERE</code> clause (if present) logically runs after the join. One common error is to perform a left outer join and then include a WHERE clause with a condition on the right table that ends up excluding the non matching rows. The above ends up performing the outer join...</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4bzv2.png" alt="LOJ"></p>
<p>... And then the "Where" clause runs. <code>NULL= 'Green'</code> does not evaluate to true so the row preserved by the outer join ends up discarded (along with the blue one) effectively converting the join back to an inner one.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tRHdf.png" alt="LOJtoInner"></p>
<p>If the intention was to include only rows from B where Colour is Green and all rows from A regardless the correct syntax would be</p>
<h3>SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour AND B.Colour = 'Green'</h3>

<p><strong>Joins</strong> are used to combine the data from two tables, with the result being a new, temporary table. Joins are performed based on something called a predicate, which specifies the condition to use in order to perform a join.  The difference between an inner join and an outer join is that an inner join will return only the rows that actually match based on the join predicate.
For eg- Lets consider Employee and Location table:</p>
<h3>Employee</h3>
<div class="s-table-container">
<table class="s-table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>EmpID</th>
<th>EmpName</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>13</td>
<td>Jason</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>Alex</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Ram</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>17</td>
<td>Babu</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>25</td>
<td>Johnson</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div><h3>Location</h3>
<div class="s-table-container">
<table class="s-table">

<p><em><strong>Inner Join:-</strong></em>
Inner join creates a new result table by combining column values of two tables (<em>Employee</em> and <em>Location</em>) based upon the join-predicate. The query compares each row of <em>Employee</em> with each row of <em>Location</em> to find all pairs of rows which satisfy the join-predicate. When the join-predicate is satisfied by matching non-NULL values, column values for each matched pair of rows of <em>Employee</em> and <em>Location</em> are combined into a result row.
Heres what the SQL for an inner join will look like:</p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">select</span>  <span class="hljs-operator">*</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> employee <span class="hljs-keyword">inner</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">join</span> location <span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> employee.empID <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> location.empID
<span class="hljs-keyword">OR</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">select</span>  <span class="hljs-operator">*</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> employee, location <span class="hljs-keyword">where</span> employee.empID <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> location.empID
</code></pre>
<p>Now, here is what the result of running that SQL would look like:</p>
<div class="s-table-container">
<table class="s-table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Employee.EmpId</th>
<th>Employee.EmpName</th>
<th>Location.EmpId</th>
<th>Location.EmpLoc</th>
</tr>

<td>13</td>

<p><strong>Outer Join:-</strong>
An outer join does not require each record in the two joined tables to have a matching record. The joined table retains each recordeven if no other matching record exists. Outer joins subdivide further into left outer joins and right outer joins, depending on which table's rows are retained (left or right).</p>
<p><em><strong>Left Outer Join:-</strong></em>
The result of a left outer join (or simply left join) for tables <em>Employee</em> and <em>Location</em> always contains all records of the "left" table (<em>Employee</em>), even if the join-condition does not find any matching record in the "right" table (<em>Location</em>).
Here is what the SQL for a left outer join would look like, using the tables above:</p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">select</span>  <span class="hljs-operator">*</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> employee <span class="hljs-keyword">left</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">outer</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">join</span> location <span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> employee.empID <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> location.empID;
<span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-operator">/</span>Use <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">outer</span> keyword <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> optional
</code></pre>
<p>Now, here is what the result of running this SQL would look like:</p>
<div class="s-table-container">
<table class="s-table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Employee.EmpId</th>
<th>Employee.EmpName</th>
<th>Location.EmpId</th>
<th>Location.EmpLoc</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>13</td>
<td>Jason</td>
<td>13</td>
<td>San Jose</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>Alex</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>Los Angeles</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Ram</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>Pune, India</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>17</td>
<td>Babu</td>
<td>17</td>
<td>Chennai, India</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>25</strong></td>
<td><strong>Johnson</strong></td>
<td><strong>NULL</strong></td>
<td><strong>NULL</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>Note how while Johnson has no entry in the employee location table, he is still included in the results but the location fields are nulled.</p>
<p><em><strong>Right Outer Join:-</strong></em>
A right outer join (or right join) closely resembles a left outer join, except with the treatment of the tables reversed. Every row from the "right" table (<em>Location</em>) will appear in the joined table at least once. If no matching row from the "left" table (<em>Employee</em>) exists, NULL will appear in columns from <em>Employee</em> for those records that have no match in <em>Location</em>.
This is what the SQL looks like:</p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">select</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> employee <span class="hljs-keyword">right</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">outer</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">join</span> location  <span class="hljs-keyword">on</span> employee.empID <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> location.empID;
<span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-operator">/</span>Use <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">outer</span> keyword <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> optional
</code></pre>
<p>Using the tables above, we can show what the result set of a right outer join would look like:</p>
<div class="s-table-container">
<table class="s-table">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Employee.EmpId</th>
<th>Employee.EmpName</th>
<th>Location.EmpId</th>
<th>Location.EmpLoc</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>13</td>
<td>Jason</td>
<td>13</td>
<td>San Jose</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>Alex</td>
<td>8</td>
<td>Los Angeles</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Ram</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>Pune, India</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>17</td>
<td>Babu</td>
<td>17</td>
<td>Chennai, India</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>NULL</strong></td>
<td><strong>NULL</strong></td>
<td><strong>39</strong></td>
<td><strong>Bangalore, India</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>Note how while there are no employees listed as working in Bangalore, it is still included in the results with the employee fields nulled out.</p>
<p><strong>Full Outer Joins:-</strong>
Full Outer Join or Full Join is to retain the nonmatching information by including nonmatching rows in the results of a join, use a full outer join. It includes all rows from both tables, regardless of whether or not the other table has a matching value.</p>
<div class="s-table-container">
<table class="s-table">

<th>Employee.EmpName</th>

<p><strong>Right join</strong> : Exactly opposite of left join . Put name of table in LEFT JOIN at right side in Right join , you get same output as LEFT JOIN.</p>
<p><strong>Outer join</strong> : Show all records in Both tables <code>No matter what</code>. If records in Left table are not matching to right table based on Primary , Forieign key , use NULL value as result of join .</p>
<p><strong>Example :</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/pCErn.png" alt="Example"></p>
<p>Lets assume now for 2 tables</p>
<p><code>1.employees  , 2.phone_numbers_employees</code></p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">employees : id , name 

phone_numbers_employees : id , phone_num , emp_id   
</code></pre>
<p>Here , employees table is Master table , phone_numbers_employees is child table(it contains <code>emp_id</code> as foreign key which connects <code>employee.id</code> so its child table.)</p>
<p><strong>Inner joins</strong></p>
<p>Take the records of 2 tables <strong>ONLY IF Primary key of employees table(its id) matches Foreign key of Child table phone_numbers_employees(emp_id)</strong>.</p>
<p>So query would be :</p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> e.id , e.name , p.phone_num <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> employees <span class="hljs-keyword">AS</span> e <span class="hljs-keyword">INNER</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> phone_numbers_employees <span class="hljs-keyword">AS</span> p <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> e.id <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> p.emp_id;
</code></pre>
<p>Here take only matching rows on primary key = foreign key as explained above.Here non matching rows on primary key = foreign key are skipped as result of join.</p>
<p><strong>Left joins</strong> :</p>
<p>Left join retains all rows of the left table, regardless of whether there is a row that matches on the right table.</p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> e.id , e.name , p.phone_num <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> employees <span class="hljs-keyword">AS</span> e <span class="hljs-keyword">LEFT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> phone_numbers_employees <span class="hljs-keyword">AS</span> p <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> e.id <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> p.emp_id;

  <p><strong>Note :</strong><br>
  In <code>SQLite</code> there is no <code>RIGHT OUTER JOIN</code> or <code>FULL OUTER JOIN</code>.<br>
  And also in <code>MySQL</code> there is no <code>FULL OUTER JOIN</code>.</p>

<p>My answer is based on above <strong>Note</strong>.</p>

<p>When you have two tables like these: </p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-comment">--[table1]               --[table2]</span>
id <span class="hljs-operator">|</span> name                id <span class="hljs-operator">|</span> name
<span class="hljs-comment">---+-------              ---+-------</span>
<span class="hljs-number">1</span>  <span class="hljs-operator">|</span> a1                  <span class="hljs-number">1</span>  <span class="hljs-operator">|</span> a2
<span class="hljs-number">2</span>  <span class="hljs-operator">|</span> b1                  <span class="hljs-number">3</span>  <span class="hljs-operator">|</span> b2
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>CROSS JOIN / OUTER JOIN :</strong><br>
You can have all of those tables data with <code>CROSS JOIN</code> or just with <code>,</code> like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> table1, table2
<span class="hljs-comment">--[OR]</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> table1 <span class="hljs-keyword">CROSS</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> table2

</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>INNER JOIN :</strong><br>
When you want to add a filter to above results based on a relation like <code>table1.id = table2.id</code> you can use <code>INNER JOIN</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> table1, table2 <span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> table1.id <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> table2.id

</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>LEFT [OUTER] JOIN :</strong><br>
When you want to have all rows of one of tables in the above result -with same relation- you can use <code>LEFT JOIN</code>:<br>
(For <strong>RIGHT JOIN</strong> just change place of tables)</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> table1, table2 <span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> table1.id <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> table2.id

<p><strong>FULL OUTER JOIN :</strong><br>
When you also want to have all rows of the other table in your results you can use <code>FULL OUTER JOIN</code>:</p>

<p><strong>Inner join.</strong> </p>

<p>A join is combining the rows from two tables. An <em>inner join</em> attempts to match up the two tables based on the criteria you specify in the query, and only returns the rows that match. If a row from the first table in the join matches two rows in the second table, then two rows will be returned in the results. If theres a row in the first table that doesnt match a row in the second, its not returned; likewise, if theres a row in the second table that doesnt match a row in the first, its not returned.</p>

<p><strong>Outer Join.</strong> </p>

<p>A <em>left join</em> attempts to find match up the rows from the first table to rows in the second table. If it cant find a match, it will return the columns from the first table and leave the columns from the second table blank (null).</p>

<ul>
<li><code>INNER JOIN</code> most typical join for two or more tables.
It returns data match on both table ON primarykey and forignkey relation.</li>
<li><code>OUTER JOIN</code> is same as <code>INNER JOIN</code>, but it also include <code>NULL</code> data on ResultSet.

<ul>
<li><code>LEFT JOIN</code> = <code>INNER JOIN</code> + Unmatched data of <strong>left</strong> table with <code>Null</code> match on right table.</li>
<li><code>RIGHT JOIN</code> = <code>INNER JOIN</code> + Unmatched data of <strong>right</strong> table with <code>Null</code> match on left table.</li>
<li><code>FULL JOIN</code> = <code>INNER JOIN</code> + Unmatched data on <strong>both right and left</strong> tables with <code>Null</code> matches.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Self join is not a keyword in SQL, when a table references data in itself knows as self join. Using <code>INNER JOIN</code> and <code>OUTER JOIN</code> we can write self join queries.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>

<p>I don't see much details about performance and optimizer in the other answers.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is good to know that only <code>INNER JOIN</code> is associative which means the optimizer has the most option to play with it. It can reorder the join order to make it faster keeping the same result. The optimizer can use the most join modes.</p>

<p>Generally it is a good practice to try to use <code>INNER JOIN</code> instead of the different kind of joins. (Of course if it is possible considering the expected result set.)</p>

<p>There are a couple of good examples and explanation here about this strange associative behavior:</p>

<p>Having criticized the much-loved red-shaded Venn diagram, I thought it only fair to post my own attempt.</p>

<p>Although @Martin Smith's answer is the best of this bunch by a long way, his only shows the key column from each table, whereas I think ideally non-key columns should also be shown.</p>

<p>The best I could do in the half hour allowed, I still don't think it adequately shows that the nulls are there due to absence of key values in <code>TableB</code> or that <code>OUTER JOIN</code> is actually a union rather than a join:</p>

<p>The precise algorithm for <code>INNER JOIN</code>, <code>LEFT/RIGHT OUTER JOIN</code> are as following: </p>

<ol>
<li>Take each row from the first table: <code>a</code></li>
<li>Consider all rows from second table beside it: <code>(a, b[i])</code></li>
<li>Evaluate the <code>ON ...</code> clause against each pair: <code>ON( a, b[i] ) = true/false?</code>

<ul>
<li>When the condition evaluates to <code>true</code>, return that combined row  <code>(a, b[i])</code>.</li>
<li>When reach end of second table without any match, and this is an <code>Outer Join</code> then return a <em>(virtual)</em> pair using <code>Null</code> for all columns of other table: <code>(a, Null)</code> for LEFT outer join or <code>(Null, b)</code> for RIGHT outer join. This is to ensure all rows of first table exists in final results.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> the condition specified in <code>ON</code> clause could be anything, it is not required to use <em>Primary Keys</em> (and you don't need to always refer to Columns from both tables)! For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>... ON T1.title = T2.title AND T1.version &lt; T2.version</code> ( =&gt; see this post as a sample usage: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/7745635/2803565">Select only rows with max value on a column</a>)</li>
<li><code>... ON T1.y IS NULL</code></li>
<li><code>... ON 1 = 0</code> (just as sample)</li>
</ul>

<h1>The General Idea</h1>
<p>Please see the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/27458534/12695027">answer</a> by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/73226">Martin Smith</a> for a better illustations and explanations of the different joins, including and especially differences between <code>FULL OUTER JOIN</code>, <code>RIGHT OUTER JOIN</code> and <code>LEFT OUTER JOIN</code>.</p>
<p>These two table form a basis for the representation of the <code>JOIN</code>s below:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/DEAAy.png" alt="Basis"></p>
<h3>CROSS JOIN</h3>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EqnB9.png" alt="CrossJoin"></p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> citizen
 <span class="hljs-keyword">CROSS</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> postalcode
</code></pre>
<p>The result will be the Cartesian products of all combinations. No <code>JOIN</code> condition required:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/eeFIB.png" alt="CrossJoinResult"></p>
<h3>INNER JOIN</h3>
<p><code>INNER JOIN</code> is the same as simply: <code>JOIN</code></p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/oXqs0.png" alt="InnerJoin"></p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> citizen    c
  <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> postalcode p <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> c.postal <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> p.postal
</code></pre>
<p>The result will be combinations that satisfies the required <code>JOIN</code> condition:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/aaNvi.png" alt="InnerJoinResult"></p>
<h3>LEFT OUTER JOIN</h3>
<p><code>LEFT OUTER JOIN</code> is the same as <code>LEFT JOIN</code></p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/qmy29.png" alt="LeftJoin"></p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> citizen         c
  <span class="hljs-keyword">LEFT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> postalcode p <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> c.postal <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> p.postal
</code></pre>
<p>The result will be everything from <code>citizen</code> even if there are no matches in <code>postalcode</code>. Again a <code>JOIN</code> condition is required:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/mbaqJ.png" alt="LeftJoinResult"></p>

<h1>The troubles with the Venn diagram</h1>
<p>An image internet search on "sql join cross inner outer" will show a multitude of Venn diagrams. I used to have a printed copy of one on my desk. But there are issues with the representation.</p>
<p>Venn diagram are excellent for set theory, where an element can be in one or both sets. But for databases, an element in one "set" seem, to me, to be a row in a table, and therefore not also present in any other tables. There is no such thing as one row present in multiple tables. A row is unique to the table.</p>
<p>Self joins are a corner case where each element is in fact the same in both sets. But it's still not free of any of the issues below.</p>
<p>The set <code>A</code> represents the set on the left (the <code>citizen</code> table) and the set <code>B</code> is the set on the right (the <code>postalcode</code> table) in below discussion.</p>
<h3>CROSS JOIN</h3>
<p>Every element in both sets are matched with every element in the other set, meaning we need <code>A</code> amount of every <code>B</code> elements and <code>B</code> amount of every <code>A</code> elements to properly represent this Cartesian product. Set theory isn't made for multiple identical elements in a set, so I find Venn diagrams to properly represent it impractical/impossible. It doesn't seem that <code>UNION</code> fits at all.</p>
<p>The rows are distinct. The <code>UNION</code> is 7 rows in total. But they're incompatible for a common <code>SQL</code> results set. And this is not how a <code>CROSS JOIN</code> works at all:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MqN6E.png" alt="CrossJoinUnion1"></p>
<p>Trying to represent it like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1BhEE.png" alt="CrossJoinUnion2Crossing"></p>
<p>..but now it just looks like an <code>INTERSECTION</code>, which it's certainly <strong>not</strong>. Furthermore there's no element in the <code>INTERSECTION</code> that is actually in any of the two distinct sets. However, it looks very much like the searchable results similar to this:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/syxYr.png" alt="CrossJoinUnionUnion3"></p>
<p>For reference one searchable result for <code>CROSS JOIN</code>s can be seen at <a href="https://www.tutorialgateway.org/sql-joins/" rel="noreferrer">Tutorialgateway</a>. The <code>INTERSECTION</code>, just like this one, is empty.</p>
<h3>INNER JOIN</h3>
<p>The value of an element depends on the <code>JOIN</code> condition. It's possible to represent this under the condition that every row becomes unique to that condition. Meaning <code>id=x</code> is only true for <strong>one</strong> row. Once a row in table <code>A</code> (<code>citizen</code>) matches multiple rows in table <code>B</code> (<code>postalcode</code>) under the <code>JOIN</code> condition, the result has the same problems as the <code>CROSS JOIN</code>: The row needs to be represented multiple times, and the set theory isn't really made for that. Under the condition of uniqueness, the diagram could work though, but keep in mind that the <code>JOIN</code> condition determines the placement of an element in the diagram. Looking only at the values of the <code>JOIN</code> condition with the rest of the row just along for the ride:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/djpSE.png" alt="InnerJoinIntersection - Filled"></p>
<p>This representation falls completely apart when using an <code>INNER JOIN</code> with a <code>ON 1 = 1</code> condition making it into a <code>CROSS JOIN</code>.</p>
<p>With a self-<code>JOIN</code>, the rows are in fact idential elements in both tables, but representing the tables as both <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> isn't very suitable. For example a common self-<code>JOIN</code> condition that makes an element in <code>A</code> to be matching a <strong>different</strong> element in B is <code>ON A.parent = B.child</code>, making the match from <code>A</code> to <code>B</code> on seperate elements. From the examples that would be a <code>SQL</code> like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> citizen c1
  <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> citizen c2 <span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> c1.id <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> c2.leader
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/p5r7D.png" alt="SelfJoinResult"></p>
<p>Meaning Smith is the leader of both Green and Jensen.</p>
<h3>OUTER JOIN</h3>
<p>Again the troubles begin when one row has multiple matches to rows in the other table. This is further complicated because the <code>OUTER JOIN</code> can be though of as to match the empty set. But in set theory the union of any set <code>C</code> and an empty set, is always just <code>C</code>. The empty set adds nothing. The representation of this <code>LEFT OUTER JOIN</code> is usually just showing all of <code>A</code> to illustrate that rows in <code>A</code> are selected regardless of whether there is a match or not from <code>B</code>. The "matching elements" however has the same problems as the illustration above. They depend on the condition. And the empty set seems to have wandered over to <code>A</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q2yFW.png" alt="LeftJoinIntersection - Filled"></p>
<h3>WHERE clause - making sense</h3>
<p>Finding all rows from a <code>CROSS JOIN</code> with Smith and postalcode on the Moon:</p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> citizen          c
 <span class="hljs-keyword">CROSS</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> postalcode  p
 <span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> c.name <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'Smith'</span>
   <span class="hljs-keyword">AND</span> p.area <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'Moon'</span>;
</code></pre>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Iy4Z3.png" alt="Where - result"></p>
<p>Now the Venn diagram isn't used to reflect the <code>JOIN</code>. It's used <strong>only</strong> for the <code>WHERE</code> clause:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/fmxEr.png" alt="Where"></p>
<p>..and that makes sense.</p>
<h1>When INTERSECT and UNION makes sense</h1>
<h3>INTERSECT</h3>
<p>As explained an <code>INNER JOIN</code> is not really an <code>INTERSECT</code>. However <code>INTERSECT</code>s can be used on results of seperate queries. Here a Venn diagram makes sense, because the elements from the seperate queries are in fact rows that either belonging to just one of the results or both. Intersect will obviously only return results where the row is present in both queries. This <code>SQL</code> will result in the same row as the one above <code>WHERE</code>, and the Venn diagram will also be the same:</p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> citizen          c
 <span class="hljs-keyword">CROSS</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> postalcode  p
 <span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> c.name <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'Smith'</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">INTERSECT</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> citizen          c
 <span class="hljs-keyword">CROSS</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> postalcode  p
 <span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> p.area <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'Moon'</span>;
</code></pre>
<h3>UNION</h3>
<p>An <code>OUTER JOIN</code> is not a <code>UNION</code>. However <code>UNION</code> work under the same conditions as <code>INTERSECT</code>, resulting in a return of all results combining both <code>SELECT</code>s:</p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> citizen          c
 <span class="hljs-keyword">CROSS</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> postalcode  p
 <span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> c.name <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'Smith'</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">UNION</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> citizen          c
 <span class="hljs-keyword">CROSS</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> postalcode  p
 <span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> p.area <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'Moon'</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>which is equivalent to:</p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> citizen          c
 <span class="hljs-keyword">CROSS</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> postalcode  p
 <span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> c.name <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'Smith'</span>
   <span class="hljs-keyword">OR</span> p.area <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'Moon'</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>..and gives the result:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/FTPRr.png" alt="Union - Result"></p>
<p>Also here a Venn diagram makes sense:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/GW69a.png" alt="UNION"></p>
<h3>When it doesn't apply</h3>
<p>An <strong>important note</strong> is that these only work when the structure of the results from the two SELECT's are the same, enabling a comparison or union. The results of these two will not enable that:</p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> citizen
 <span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> name <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'Smith'</span>
</code></pre>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> postalcode
 <span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> area <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'Moon'</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>..trying to combine the results with <code>UNION</code> gives a</p>
<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">ORA<span class="hljs-number">-01790</span>: expression must have same datatype <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">corresponding</span> expression

<p>Consider below 2 tables:</p>

<span class="hljs-number">1</span>       Rob     <span class="hljs-number">1</span>       <span class="hljs-number">100</span>
<span class="hljs-number">2</span>       Mark    <span class="hljs-number">1</span>       <span class="hljs-number">300</span>

<span class="hljs-number">4</span>       Mary    <span class="hljs-number">2</span>       <span class="hljs-number">300</span>

<span class="hljs-number">6</span>       Jose    <span class="hljs-number">6</span>       <span class="hljs-number">400</span>
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Department</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">deptid  name
<span class="hljs-number">1</span>       IT
<span class="hljs-number">2</span>       Accounts
<span class="hljs-number">3</span>       Security
<span class="hljs-number">4</span>       HR
<span class="hljs-number">5</span>       R<span class="hljs-operator">&amp;</span>D
</code></pre>

<h3>Inner Join:</h3>

<p>Mostly written as just <strong>JOIN</strong> in sql queries. It returns only the matching records between the tables.</p>

<h3>Find out all employees and their department names:</h3>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">Select</span> a.empid, a.name, b.name <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> dept_name
<span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> emp a
<span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> department b
<span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> a.dept_id <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> b.deptid
;

empid   name    dept_name
<span class="hljs-number">1</span>       Rob     IT
<span class="hljs-number">2</span>       Mark    IT
<span class="hljs-number">3</span>       John    Accounts
<span class="hljs-number">4</span>       Mary    Accounts
<span class="hljs-number">5</span>       Bill    Security
</code></pre>

<p>As you see above, <code>Jose</code> is not printed from <strong>EMP</strong> in the output as it's dept_id <code>6</code> does not find a match in the Department table.  Similarly, <code>HR</code> and <code>R&amp;D</code> rows are not printed from <strong>Department</strong> table as they didn't find a match in the Emp table. </p>

<p><strong>So, INNER JOIN or just JOIN, returns only matching rows.</strong></p>

<h3>LEFT JOIN :</h3>

<p>This returns all records from the LEFT table and only matching records from the RIGHT table.</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">Select</span> a.empid, a.name, b.name <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> dept_name
<span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> emp a
<span class="hljs-keyword">LEFT</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> department b
<span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> a.dept_id <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> b.deptid
;

empid   name    dept_name
<span class="hljs-number">1</span>       Rob     IT
<span class="hljs-number">2</span>       Mark    IT
<span class="hljs-number">3</span>       John    Accounts
<span class="hljs-number">4</span>       Mary    Accounts
<span class="hljs-number">5</span>       Bill    Security
<span class="hljs-number">6</span>       Jose    
</code></pre>

<p>So, if you observe the above output, all records from the LEFT table(Emp) are printed with just matching records from RIGHT table.</p>

<p><code>HR</code> and <code>R&amp;D</code> rows are not printed from <strong>Department</strong> table as they didn't find a match in the Emp table on dept_id.</p>

<p><strong>So, LEFT JOIN returns ALL rows from Left table and only matching rows from RIGHT table.</strong> </p>

<p>The difference between <code>inner join</code> and <code>outer join</code> is as follow:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>Inner join</code> is a join that combined tables based on matching tuples, whereas <code>outer join</code> is a join that combined table based on both matched and unmatched tuple.</li>
<li><code>Inner join</code> merges matched row from two table in where unmatched row are omitted, whereas <code>outer join</code> merges rows from two tables and unmatched rows fill with null value.</li>
<li><code>Inner join</code> is like an intersection operation, whereas <code>outer join</code> is like an union operation.</li>

<p>Basically, more often than not, <code>JOIN</code> queries boil down to two cases:</p>
<p>For a <code>SELECT</code> of a subset of <code>A</code> data:</p>
<ul>
<li>use <code>INNER JOIN</code> when the related <code>B</code> data you are looking for <strong>MUST</strong> exist per database design;</li>
<li>use <code>LEFT JOIN</code> when the related <code>B</code> data you are looking for <strong>MIGHT</strong> or <strong>MIGHT NOT</strong> exist per database design.</li>

<h2>INNER vs OUTER</h2>
<p>You can see that while an <code>INNER JOIN</code> gets only matching pairs, each kind of <code>OUTER</code> join includes some items without a match.</p>
<p>However, the actual words <code>INNER</code> and <code>OUTER</code> do not need to appear in queries:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>JOIN</code> by itself implies <code>INNER</code></li>

<h2>INNER JOIN VS. OUTER JOIN</h2>
<p>In SQL, <strong>join</strong> is used to compare and combine  literally, <strong>join</strong>  and return specific rows of data from two or more tables in a database. <code>INNER JOIN</code> finds and returns matching data from a table, while <code>OUTER JOIN</code> finds and returns matching data and some different data from a table.</p>
<hr>
<h3>INNER JOIN</h3>
<p><code>INNER JOIN</code> focuses on similarity between 2 tables. When using <code>INNER JOIN</code>, there must be at least some matching data between the two (or more) tables being compared. <code>INNER JOIN</code> searches tables for matching or overlapping data. If found, <code>INNER JOIN</code> combines the information and returns it in a new table.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Let's consider a common scenario with two tables: product price and quantity. The common information in both tables is the product name, so this is the logical column of the join table. Some products are the same in both tables; others are unique to one and have no matches in the other.</p>
<p>A product <code>INNER JOIN</code> only returns information about products that are common to both tables.</p>

<p>If you now want an <code>INNER JOIN</code> where the intersection is determined you can write the following query:</p>

<span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> Prices <span class="hljs-keyword">INNER</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">JOIN</span> Quantities
<span class="hljs-keyword">ON</span> Prices.Product <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> Quantities.Product;
</code></pre>
<p>As intersection you now get the black area from the diagram and the following query result comes out:</p>
<div class="s-table-container">
<table class="s-table">

<h3>OUTER JOIN</h3>
<p>An <code>OUTER JOIN</code> returns a set of records (or rows) that contain what the <code>INNER JOIN</code> would return, but <strong>also</strong> contain additional rows for which no corresponding match was found in another table.</p>
<p>There are three types of outer joins:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>LEFT OUTER JOIN</code> (or left join)</li>
<li><code>RIGHT OUTER JOIN</code> (or right join)</li>
<li><code>FULL OUTER JOIN</code> (or full join)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these <code>OUTER JOIN</code> refers to the portion of data that is being compared, combined, and returned. Sometimes zeros are generated in the process because some data is shared and others are not.</p>
<p><em>However, this description would now go beyond the scope of the question.</em></p>

But for databases, an element in one \u0026quot;set\u0026quot; seem, to me, to be a row in a table, and therefore not also present in any other tables. There is no such thing as one row present in multiple tables. A row is unique to the table.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Self joins are a corner case where each element is in fact the same in both sets.

For example a common self-\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;JOIN\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; condition that makes an element in \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;A\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to be matching a \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;different\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; element in B is \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ON A.parent = B.child\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, making the match from \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;A\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;B\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; on seperate elements. From the examples that would be a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;SQL\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; like this:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-sql s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-sql\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;SELECT\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-operator\u0026quot;\u0026gt;*\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n  \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;FROM\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; citizen c1\n  \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;JOIN\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; citizen c2 \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;ON\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; c1.id \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-operator\u0026quot;\u0026gt;=\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; c2.leader\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/p5r7D.png\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;SelfJoinResult\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Meaning Smith is the leader of both Green and Jensen.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;OUTER JOIN\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Again the troubles begin when one row has multiple matches to rows in the other table. This is further complicated because the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;OUTER JOIN\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; can be though of as to match the empty set. But in set theory the union of any set \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;C\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and an empty set, is always just \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;C\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. The empty set adds nothing. The representation of this \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;LEFT OUTER JOIN\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is usually just showing all of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;A\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to illustrate that rows in \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;A\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; are selected regardless of whether there is a match or not from \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;B\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. The \u0026quot;matching elements\u0026quot; however has the same problems as the illustration above. They depend on the condition.
