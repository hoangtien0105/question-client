Already have the stack trace? Read up on stack traces in &quot;What is a stack trace, and how can I use it to debug my application errors?&quot;\n\nThe Problem\n\nYour application quit because an uncaught RuntimeException was thrown.\nThe most common of these is the NullPointerException.\n\nHow to solve it?\n\nEvery time an Android application crashes (or any Java application for that matter), a Stack trace is written to the console (in this case, logcat). This stack trace contains vital information for solving your problem.\n\nAndroid Studio\n\n\n\nIn the bottom bar of the window, click on the Logcat button. Alternatively, you can press alt+6. Make sure your emulator or device is selected in the Devices panel. Next, try to find the stack trace, which is shown in red. There may be a lot of stuff logged into logcat, so you may need to scroll a bit. An easy way to find the stack trace is to clear the logcat (using the recycle bin on the right), and let the app crash again.\n\nI have found the stack trace, now what?\n\nYay! You&apos;re halfway to solving your problem.\nYou only need to find out what exactly made your application crash, by analyzing the stack trace.\n\nRead up on stack traces in &quot;What is a stack trace, and how can I use it to debug my application errors?&quot;\n\nI still can&apos;t solve my problem!\n\nIf you&apos;ve found your Exception and the line where it occurred, and still cannot figure out how to fix it, don&apos;t hesitate to ask a question on StackOverflow.  \n\nTry to be as concise as possible: post the stack trace, and the relevant code (e.g. a few lines up to the line which threw the Exception).\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You can use Google&apos;s ADB tool to get Logcat file to analyze the issue.\n\nadb logcat &gt; logcat.txt\n\n\nopen logcat.txt file and search for your application name.

For this, you can use Log.e(&quot;TAG&quot;, &quot;Message&quot;);, using this line you can see your app log in logcat.\n\nAfter that, you find which point your app has stopped it&apos;s very easy to solve at your side. \n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Just check the error in log cat. \n\nYou get the log cat option from in eclipse:\n\n\n  window-&gt;show view-&gt;others-&gt;Android-&gt;Logcat\n\n\nLog cat contains error.\n\nOther wise you can also check the error by executing an application in debug mode.\nFirstly set breakpoint after that by doing:\n\n\n  right click on project-&gt;debug as-&gt;Android application\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Note: This answer is using Android Studio 2.2.2\n\nNote 2: I am considering that your device is successfully connected. \n\n\n\nThe first thing you do when your application crashes is look into the LogCat, at the bottom of Android Studio there&apos;s a toolbar with a list of menus:\n\n\n\nClick on the &quot;Android Monitor&quot; (The one I underlined in the image above. ^)\n\nNow, you&apos;ll get something like this:\n\n\n\nChange &quot;Verbose&quot; to &quot;Error&quot; Now it will only show you logged errors. Don&apos;t worry about all these errors (if you got them) now.\n\n\n\nOk. Now, do what you did to crash your app. After your app crashes, go to your logcat. You should find a new crash log that has a lot of at:x.x.x: and Caused by: TrumpIsPresidentException for example. Go to that Caused by: statement in your logcat.\n\n\n\nNext to that Caused By:, there should be the Exception that happened. In my case, it&apos;s a RuntimeException and under it there should be a line which contains a blue link such as:\n\n\n\nIf that Caused by: DOESN&apos;T have a line with a blue text somewhere under it, then look for another Caused by: that does.\n\nClick on that blue link. It should take you to where the problem occured. In my case, it was due to this line:\n\nthrow new RuntimeException();\n\n\nSo, now I know why it&apos;s crashing. It&apos;s because I&apos;m throwing the exception myself. This was an obvious error.\n\n\n\nHowever, let&apos;s say I got another error:\n\njava.lang.NullPointerException\n\n\nI checked my logcat, I clicked on the blue link it gave me, and it took me here:\n\nmTextView.setText(myString);\n\n\nSo, now I want to debug. According to this StackOverflow question, a NullPointerException says that something is null.\n\nSo, let&apos;s find out what is null. There&apos;s two possibilities. Either mTextView is null, or myString is null. To find out, before the mTextView.setText(mString) line, I add these two lines:\n\nLog.d(&quot;AppDebug&quot;,&quot;mTextView is null: &quot; + String.valueOf(mTextView == null);\nLog.d(&quot;AppDebug&quot;,&quot;myString is null: &quot; + String.valueOf(myString== null);\n\n\nNow, like we did previously (We changed Verose to Error), we want to change &quot;Error&quot; to &quot;Debug&quot;. Since we&apos;re logging by debugging. Here&apos;s all the Log methods:\n\nLog.\n  d means Debug\n  e means error\n  w means warning\n  v means verbose\n  i means information\n  wtf means &quot;What a terrible failure&quot;. This is similar to Log.e\n\n\nSo, since we used Log.d, we&apos;re checking in Debug. That&apos;s why we changed it to debug.\n\nNotice Log.d has a first parameter,in our case &quot;AppDebug&quot;. Click on the &quot;No Filters&quot; drop down menu on the top-right of the logcat. Select &quot;Edit Filter Configuration&quot;, give a name to your filter, and in &quot;Log Tag&quot; put &quot;App Debug&quot;. Click &quot;OK&quot;. Now, you should see two lines in the logcat:\n\nyourPackageNameAndApp: mTextView is null: true\nyourPackageNameAndApp: myString is null: false\n\n\nSo now we know that mTextView is null. \n\nI observe my code, now I notice something.\n\nI have private TextView mTextView declared at the top of my class. But, I&apos;m not defining it.\n\nBasically I forgot to do this in my onCreate():\n\nmTextView = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textview_id_in_xml);\n\n\nSo THAT&apos;S why mTextView is null, because I forgot to tell my app what it is. So I add that line, run my app, and now the app doesn&apos;t crash.\n\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"This popup shows only when you get a fatal exception in your code which stops the execution of the app. It could be any exception NullPointerException, OutOfMemoryException etc.\n\nBest way to check is through Logcat if you are still developing the app in Android studio which is quick way to read stack trace and check the cause of the app.\n\nIf your app is already live, then you can not use logcat.

<p><em>This answer describes the process of retrieving the stack trace. Already have the stack trace?

<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>Your application quit because an uncaught <code>RuntimeException</code> was thrown.<br>
The most common of these is the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/218384/what-is-a-nullpointerexception-and-how-do-i-fix-it"><code>NullPointerException</code></a>.</p>

<h1>How to solve it?</h1>

<p>Every time an Android application crashes (or any Java application for that matter), a <code>Stack trace</code> is written to the console (in this case, logcat). This stack trace contains vital information for solving your problem.</p>

<h2>Android Studio</h2>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZL3Y8.png" alt="Finding the stack trace in Android Studio"></p>

<p>In the bottom bar of the window, click on the <code>Logcat</code> button. Alternatively, you can press <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>6</kbd>. Make sure your emulator or device is selected in the <code>Devices</code> panel. Next, try to find the stack trace, which is shown in red. There may be a lot of stuff logged into logcat, so you may need to scroll a bit. An easy way to find the stack trace is to clear the logcat (using the recycle bin on the right), and let the app crash again.</p>

<h1>I have found the stack trace, now what?</h1>

<p>Yay! You're halfway to solving your problem.<br>
You only need to find out what exactly made your application crash, by analyzing the stack trace.</p>

<p>Read up on stack traces in "<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3988788/what-is-a-stack-trace-and-how-can-i-use-it-to-debug-my-application-errors">What is a stack trace, and how can I use it to debug my application errors?</a>"</p>

<h1>I still can't solve my problem!</h1>

<p>If you've found your <code>Exception</code> and the line where it occurred, and still cannot figure out how to fix it, don't hesitate to ask a question on StackOverflow.  </p>

<p>Try to be as concise as possible: post the stack trace, and the <em>relevant</em> code (e.g. a few lines up to the line which threw the <code>Exception</code>).</p>

<p>First, you check which point your app has crashed (<code>Unfortunately, MyApp has stopped.</code>). For this, you can use <code>Log.e("TAG", "Message");</code>, using this line you can see your app log in logcat.</p>

<p>Just check the error in log cat. </p>

<p>You get the log cat option from in eclipse:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>window-&gt;show view-&gt;others-&gt;Android-&gt;Logcat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Log cat contains error.</p>

<p>Other wise you can also check the error by executing an application in debug mode.
Firstly set breakpoint after that by doing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>right click on project-&gt;debug as-&gt;Android application</p>

<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> This answer is using Android Studio 2.2.2</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Note 2:</em></strong> <em>I am considering that your device is successfully connected.</em> </p>

<hr>

<p>The first thing you do when your application crashes is look into the LogCat, at the bottom of Android Studio there's a toolbar with a list of menus:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1hRMI.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/1hRMI.png" alt="image"></a></p>

<p>Click on the "Android Monitor" (The one I underlined in the image above. ^)</p>

<p>Now, you'll get something like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f71Qd.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/f71Qd.png" alt="image"></a></p>

<p>Change "<code>Verbose</code>" to "<code>Error</code>" Now it will only show you logged errors. Don't worry about all these errors (if you got them) now.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gpkIa.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gpkIa.png" alt="image"></a></p>

<p>Ok. Now, do what you did to crash your app. After your app crashes, go to your logcat. You should find a new crash log that has a lot of <code>at:x.x.x</code>: and <code>Caused by: TrumpIsPresidentException</code> for example. Go to that <code>Caused by:</code> statement in your logcat.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dmNaz.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dmNaz.png" alt="image"></a></p>

<p><strong>Next to</strong> that <code>Caused By:</code>, there should be the Exception that happened. In my case, it's a <code>RuntimeException</code> and <strong>under it</strong> there should be a line which contains a <strong>blue link</strong> such as:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VC156.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/VC156.png" alt="image"></a></p>

<p><strong>If that <code>Caused by:</code></strong> DOESN'T have a line with a blue text somewhere under it, then look for another <code>Caused by:</code> that does.</p>

<p><strong>Click on that blue link</strong>. It should take you to where the problem occured. In my case, it was due to this line:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-keyword">throw</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">RuntimeException</span>();
</code></pre>

<p>So, now I know why it's crashing. It's because I'm throwing the exception myself. <strong>This was an obvious error</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>However, let's say I got another error:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-undefined">java.lang.NullPointerException
</code></pre>

<p>I checked my logcat, I clicked on the blue link it gave me, and it took me here:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-scss">mTextView<span class="hljs-selector-class">.setText</span>(myString);
</code></pre>

<p>So, now I want to debug. According to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/218384/what-is-a-nullpointerexception-and-how-do-i-fix-it">this StackOverflow question</a>, a NullPointerException says that something is <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>So, let's find out <strong>what is null</strong>. There's two possibilities. Either <code>mTextView</code> is null, or <code>myString</code> is null. To find out, before the <code>mTextView.setText(mString)</code> line, I add these two lines:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-coffeescript">Log.d(<span class="hljs-string">"AppDebug"</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"mTextView is null: "</span> + <span class="hljs-built_in">String</span>.valueOf(mTextView == <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>);
Log.d(<span class="hljs-string">"AppDebug"</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"myString is null: "</span> + <span class="hljs-built_in">String</span>.valueOf(myString== <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>Now, like we did previously (We changed Verose to Error), we want to change "Error" to "Debug". Since we're logging by debugging. Here's all the Log methods:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vhdl">Log.
  d means Debug
  e means <span class="hljs-literal">error</span>
  w means <span class="hljs-literal">warning</span>
  v means verbose
  i means information
  wtf means <span class="hljs-string">"What a terrible failure"</span>. This <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> similar <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> Log.e
</code></pre>

<p>So, since we used <code>Log.d</code>, we're checking in Debug. That's why we changed it to debug.</p>

<p>Notice <code>Log.d</code> has a first parameter,in our case "AppDebug". Click on the "No Filters" drop down menu on the top-right of the logcat. Select "Edit Filter Configuration", give a name to your filter, and in "Log Tag" put "App Debug". Click "OK". Now, you should see two lines in the logcat:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp">yourPackageNameAndApp: mTextView <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
yourPackageNameAndApp: myString <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>
</code></pre>

<p>So now we know that mTextView is null. </p>

<p>I observe my code, now I notice something.</p>

<p>I have <code>private TextView mTextView</code> declared at the top of my class. But, I'm not defining it.</p>

<p>Basically I forgot to do this in my onCreate():</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-ini"><span class="hljs-attr">mTextView</span> = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textview_id_in_xml)<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>So THAT'S why <code>mTextView</code> is null, because I forgot to tell my app what it is. So I add that line, run my app, and now the app doesn't crash.</p>

<p>This popup shows only when you get a fatal exception in your code which stops the execution of the app. It could be any exception <code>NullPointerException</code>, <code>OutOfMemoryException</code> etc.</p>

<p>Best way to check is through <em>Logcat</em> if you are still developing the app in Android studio which is quick way to read stack trace and check the cause of the app.</p>

<p>I suggest to use <strong>Android Debug Monitor</strong>, it is good. Because eclipse hangs when too many logs are there, and through adb logcat filter and all difficult.</p>

<p>Let me share a basic Logcat analysis for when you meet a Force Close (when the app stops working).</p>

<p><strong>DOCS</strong></p>

<p>The basic tool from Android to collect/analyze logs is the logcat. </p>

<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">HERE</a> is the Android's page about logcat</p>

<p>If you use android Studio, you can also check this <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/index.html#systemLogView" rel="nofollow noreferrer">LINK</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Capturing</strong></p>

<p>Basically, you can MANUALLY capture logcat with the following command (or just check AndroidMonitor window in AndroidStudio):</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-undefined">adb logcat
</code></pre>

<p>There's a lot of parameters you can add to the command which helps you to filter and display the message that you want... This is personal...  I always use the command below to get the message timestamp:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css">adb logcat -v <span class="hljs-selector-tag">time</span>
</code></pre>

<p>You can redirect the output to a file and analyze it in a Text Editor.</p>

<p><strong>Analyzing</strong></p>

<p>If you app is Crashing, you'll get something like:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-number">07</span>-<span class="hljs-number">09</span> <span class="hljs-number">08</span>:<span class="hljs-number">29</span>:<span class="hljs-number">13.474</span> <span class="hljs-number">21144</span>-<span class="hljs-number">21144</span>/com.example.khan.abc D/AndroidRuntime: Shutting down VM

</code></pre>

<p>This part of the log shows you a lot of information:</p>

<ul>
<li>When the issue happened: <code>07-09 08:29:13.475</code></li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to check when the issue happened... You may find several errors in a log... you must be sure that you are checking the proper messages :)</p>

<ul>
<li>Which app crashed: <code>com.example.khan.abc</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This way, you know which app crashed (to be sure that you are checking the logs about your message)</p>

<ul>
<li>Which ERROR: <code>java.lang.NullPointerException</code></li>
</ul>

<p>A NULL Pointer Exception error</p>

<ul>
<li>Detailed info about the error: <code>Attempt to invoke virtual method 'void android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity.onBackPressed()' on a null object reference</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You tried to call method <code>onBackPressed()</code> from a <code>FragmentActivity</code> object. However, that object was <code>null</code> when you did it.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Stack Trace: Stack Trace shows you the method invocation order... Sometimes, the error happens in the calling method (and not in the called method).</p>

<p>at com.example.khan.abc.AudioFragment$1.onClick(AudioFragment.java:125)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Error happened in file <code>com.example.khan.abc.AudioFragment.java</code>, inside <code>onClick()</code> method at line: <code>125</code> (stacktrace shows the line that error happened)</p>

<p>It was called by:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vhdl">at android.<span class="hljs-keyword">view</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">View</span>.performClick(<span class="hljs-keyword">View</span>.java:<span class="hljs-number">4848</span>)

<p>Which was called by:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vhdl">at android.<span class="hljs-keyword">view</span>.<span class="hljs-keyword">View</span>$PerformClick.run(<span class="hljs-keyword">View</span>.java:<span class="hljs-number">20262</span>)

<p>etc....</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>This was just an overview... Not all logs are simple but the error gives specific problem and verbose shows up all problem ... It is just to share the idea and provide entry-level information to you... </p>

<p>I hope I could help you someway...

<p>Use the <strong>LogCat</strong> and try to find what is causing the app to crash.</p>

<p>To see Logcat if you use <strong>Android Studio</strong> then Press <strong>ALT + 6</strong>
or</p>

<p>if you use <strong>Eclipse</strong> then 
<strong>Window -&gt; Open Perspective -&gt; Other - LogCat</strong> </p>

<p>Go to the LogCat, from the drop down menu select error. This will contain all the required information to help you debug. If that doesn't help, post the LogCat as an edit to your question and somebody will help you out.</p>

<p>If your app for some reason crashes without good stacktrace. Try debug it from first line, and go line by line until crash. Then you will have answer, which line is causing you trouble. Proably you could then wrapp it into try catch block and print error output.</p>

<p>You can also get this error message on its own, without any stack trace or any further error message.</p>

<p>In this case you need to make sure your Android manifest is configured correctly (including any manifest merging happening from a library and any activity that would come from a library), and pay particular attention to the first activity displayed in your application in your manifest files.</p>

<p>People make mistakes, and so coding as well. </p>

<p>When ever any <code>error</code> happened, always check with the logcat with the text in red color however u can find out the <em>real problem in blue color text with underline</em> in those red color text. </p>

<p>Make sure if u create a new <code>activity</code>, always declare the <code>activity</code> in the <code>AndroidManifest</code> file.</p>

<p>If adding Permission, declare it in the <code>AndroidMainifest</code> file as well.</p>

<p><strong>Logcat</strong> - <strong>To check the logs in the development phase of Android Studio</strong></p>

<p>Initially clear the Logcat and let the app crash again so you can get only crashed log detail. You have to check the Stack trace</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While, Unfortunately, MyApp has stopped. There are many reasons for it. You can check same in logs. For this, you can use the Log.e("TAG","Message");</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Common error during app crash like:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Coding mistake(Wrong use of keywords).</li>
<li>Mismatch property name.</li>
<li>Unsupported plugin(maybe).</li>
<li>Mismatch version(maybe).</li>
<li>Activity missing in AndroidManifest file.</li>
<li>Permission missing in AndroidManifest file.</li>
<li>Most common NullPointerException.</li>
<li>Declared but not defined.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>To resolve app crash error:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Keep in mind above points and go through it.</li>
<li>With the error, you will get the file name also in blue colour (click on them and jump to code from error is occurring).</li>

<h3>Crash during development</h3>

<p>Try my favourite tool <a href="https://bitbucket.org/mlopatkin/android-log-viewer/downloads/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">logview</a> to get the logs and analyze them during development.<br>
Make sure to mark <code>./logview</code> and <code>./lib/logview.jar</code> as executable when running in Linux.</p>

<p>If you don't like it, there're a lot of alternative <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/4325073/1429387">desktop log viewers for Android</a>.</p>

<h3>Crash in the wild</h3>

<p>Integrate a real-time crash reporting tool such as <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Firebase Crashlytics</a> in order to get stacktraces of unhandled exceptions which occurred on users' devices.</p>
