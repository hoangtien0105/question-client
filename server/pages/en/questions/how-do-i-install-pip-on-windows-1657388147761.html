Python 3.4 (released March 2014) and Python 2.7.9 (released December 2014) ship with Pip. This is the best feature of any Python release. It makes the community&apos;s wealth of libraries accessible to everyone. Newbies are no longer excluded from using community libraries by the prohibitive difficulty of setup. In shipping with a package manager, Python joins Ruby, Node.js, Haskell, Perl, Goalmost every other contemporary language with a majority open-source community. Thank you, Python.\n\nIf you do find that pip is not available when using Python 3.4+ or Python 2.7.9+, simply execute e.g.:\n\npy -3 -m ensurepip\n\n\nOf course, that doesn&apos;t mean Python packaging is problem solved. The experience remains frustrating. I discuss this in the Stack Overflow question Does Python have a package/module management system?.\n\nAnd, alas for everyone using Python 2.7.8 or earlier (a sizable portion of the community). There&apos;s no plan to ship Pip to you. Manual instructions follow.\n\nPython 2  2.7.8 and Python 3  3.3\n\nFlying in the face of its &apos;batteries included&apos; motto, Python ships without a package manager. To make matters worse, Pip wasuntil recentlyironically difficult to install.\n\nOfficial instructions\n\nPer https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#do-i-need-to-install-pip:\n\nDownload get-pip.py, being careful to save it as a .py file rather than .txt. Then, run it from the command prompt:\n\npython get-pip.py\n\n\nYou possibly need an administrator command prompt to do this. Follow Start a Command Prompt as an Administrator (Microsoft TechNet).\n\nThis installs the pip package, which (in Windows) contains ...\\Scripts\\pip.exe that path must be in PATH environment variable to use pip from the command line (see the second part of &apos;Alternative Instructions&apos; for adding it to your PATH,\n\nAlternative instructions\n\nThe official documentation tells users to install Pip and each of its dependencies from source. That&apos;s tedious for the experienced and prohibitively difficult for newbies.\n\nFor our sake, Christoph Gohlke prepares Windows installers (.msi) for popular Python packages. He builds installers for all Python versions, both 32 and 64 bit. You need to:\n\n\nInstall setuptools\nInstall pip\n\n\nFor me, this installed Pip at C:\\Python27\\Scripts\\pip.exe. Find pip.exe on your computer, then add its folder (for example, C:\\Python27\\Scripts) to your path (Start / Edit environment variables). Now you should be able to run pip from the command line. Try installing a package:\n\npip install httpie\n\n\nThere you go (hopefully)! Solutions for common problems are given below:\n\nProxy problems\n\nIf you work in an office, you might be behind an HTTP proxy. If so, set the environment variables http_proxy and https_proxy. Most Python applications (and other free software) respect these. Example syntax:\n\nhttp://proxy_url:port\nhttp://username:password@proxy_url:port\n\n\nIf you&apos;re really unlucky, your proxy might be a Microsoft NTLM proxy. Free software can&apos;t cope. The only solution is to install a free software friendly proxy that forwards to the nasty proxy. http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/\n\nUnable to find vcvarsall.bat\n\nPython modules can be partly written in C or C++. Pip tries to compile from source. If you don&apos;t have a C/C++ compiler installed and configured, you&apos;ll see this cryptic error message.\n\n\n  Error: Unable to find vcvarsall.bat\n\n\nYou can fix that by installing a C++ compiler such as MinGW or Visual C++. Microsoft actually ships one specifically for use with Python. Or try Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7.\n\nOften though it&apos;s easier to check Christoph&apos;s site for your package.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"-- Outdated -- use distribute, not setuptools as described here. --\n-- Outdated #2 -- use setuptools as distribute is deprecated.\n\nAs you mentioned pip doesn&apos;t include an independent installer, but you can install it with its predecessor easy_install.\n\nSo:\n\n\nDownload the last pip version from here: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip#downloads\nUncompress it\nDownload the last easy installer for Windows: (download the .exe at the bottom of http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools ).

You can install an Express version of Microsoft Visual C++ 2008, but it is not maintained. Your best bet is to get an express version of a later Microsoft Visual C++ and compile Python.

<h2>Python 2.7.9+ and 3.4+</h2>

<p>Good news! <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html" rel="noreferrer">Python 3.4</a> (released March 2014) and <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/whatsnew/2.7.html#pep-477-backport-ensurepip-pep-453-to-python-2-7" rel="noreferrer">Python 2.7.9</a> (released December 2014) ship with Pip. This is the best feature of any Python release. It makes the community's wealth of libraries accessible to everyone. Newbies are no longer excluded from using community libraries by the prohibitive difficulty of setup. In shipping with a package manager, Python joins <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29" rel="noreferrer">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js" rel="noreferrer">Node.js</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29" rel="noreferrer">Haskell</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl" rel="noreferrer">Perl</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29" rel="noreferrer">Go</a>almost every other contemporary language with a majority open-source community. Thank you, Python.</p>

<p>If you do find that pip is not available when using Python 3.4+ or Python 2.7.9+, simply execute e.g.:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">py -<span class="hljs-number">3</span> -m ensurepip

<p>Of course, that doesn't mean Python packaging is problem solved. The experience remains frustrating. I discuss this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2436731/does-python-have-a-package-module-management-system/13445719#13445719">in the Stack Overflow question <em>Does Python have a package/module management system?</em></a>.</p>

<p>And, alas for everyone using Python 2.7.8 or earlier (a sizable portion of the community). There's no plan to ship Pip to you. Manual instructions follow.</p>

<h2>Python 2  2.7.8 and Python 3  3.3</h2>

<p>Flying in the face of its <a href="http://www.python.org/about/" rel="noreferrer">'batteries included'</a> motto, Python ships without a package manager. To make matters worse, Pip wasuntil recentlyironically difficult to install.</p>

<h3>Official instructions</h3>

<p>Per <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#do-i-need-to-install-pip" rel="noreferrer">https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#do-i-need-to-install-pip</a>:</p>

<p>Download <a href="https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" rel="noreferrer"><code>get-pip.py</code></a>, being careful to save it as a <code>.py</code> file rather than <code>.txt</code>. Then, run it from the command prompt:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">python get-pip.py
</code></pre>

<p>You possibly need an administrator command prompt to do this. Follow <em><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc947813(v=ws.10).aspx" rel="noreferrer">Start a Command Prompt as an Administrator</a></em> (Microsoft TechNet).</p>

<p>This installs the pip package, which (in Windows) contains ...\Scripts\pip.exe that path must be in PATH environment variable to use pip from the command line (see the second part of 'Alternative Instructions' for adding it to your PATH,</p>

<h3>Alternative instructions</h3>

<p>The official documentation tells users to install Pip and each of its dependencies from source. That's tedious for the experienced and prohibitively difficult for newbies.</p>

<p>For our sake, Christoph Gohlke prepares Windows installers (<code>.msi</code>) for popular Python packages. He builds installers for all Python versions, both 32 and 64 bit. You need to:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#setuptools" rel="noreferrer">Install setuptools</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pip" rel="noreferrer">Install pip</a></li>
</ol>

<p>For me, this installed Pip at <code>C:\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe</code>. Find <code>pip.exe</code> on your computer, then add its folder (for example, <code>C:\Python27\Scripts</code>) to your path (Start / Edit environment variables). Now you should be able to run <code>pip</code> from the command line. Try installing a package:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">pip install httpie
</code></pre>

<p>There you go (hopefully)! Solutions for common problems are given below:</p>

<h3>Proxy problems</h3>

<p>If you work in an office, you might be behind an HTTP proxy. If so, set the environment variables <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>http_proxy</code> and <code>https_proxy</code></a>. Most Python applications (and other free software) respect these. Example syntax:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">http://proxy_url:port
http://username:password@proxy_url:port
</code></pre>

<p>If you're really unlucky, your proxy might be a Microsoft <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT_LAN_Manager" rel="noreferrer">NTLM</a> proxy. Free software can't cope. The only solution is to install a free software friendly proxy that forwards to the nasty proxy. <a href="http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/" rel="noreferrer">http://cntlm.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<h3>Unable to find vcvarsall.bat</h3>

<p>Python modules can be partly written in C or C++. Pip tries to compile from source. If you don't have a C/C++ compiler installed and configured, you'll see this cryptic error message.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error: Unable to find vcvarsall.bat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can fix that by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2817869/error-unable-to-find-vcvarsall-bat">installing a C++ compiler</a> such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinGW" rel="noreferrer">MinGW</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C%2B%2B#32-bit_versions" rel="noreferrer">Visual C++</a>. Microsoft actually ships one specifically for use with Python. Or try <em><a href="http://aka.ms/vcpython27" rel="noreferrer">Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7</a></em>.</p>

<p>Often though it's easier to check <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/" rel="noreferrer">Christoph's site</a> for your package.</p>

<p>As you mentioned pip doesn't include an independent installer, but you can install it with its predecessor easy_install.</p>

<p>So:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the last pip version from here: <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip#downloads" rel="noreferrer">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip#downloads</a></li>

<li>copy the uncompressed pip folder <strong>content</strong> into <code>C:\Python2x\</code> folder (don't copy the whole folder into it, just the content), because python command doesn't work outside <code>C:\Python2x</code> folder and then run:  <code>python setup.py install</code></li>
<li>Add your python <code>C:\Python2x\Scripts</code> to the path</li>
</ol>

<p>You are done. </p>

<p>Now you can use <code>pip install package</code> to easily install packages as in Linux :)</p>

<p><strong>2014 UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>1) If you have installed Python 3.4 or later, pip is included with Python and should already be working on your system.</p>

<p>2) If you are running a version below Python 3.4 or if pip was not installed with Python 3.4 for some reason, then you'd probably use pip's official installation script <code>get-pip.py</code>. The pip installer now grabs setuptools for you, and works regardless of architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).</p>

<p>The installation <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html" rel="noreferrer">instructions are detailed here</a> and involve:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To install or upgrade pip, securely download <a href="https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py" rel="noreferrer">get-pip.py</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Then run the following (which may require administrator access):</p>
</blockquote>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">python get-pip.py
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>To upgrade an existing setuptools (or distribute), run <code>pip install -U setuptools</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'll leave the two sets of old instructions below for posterity.</p>

<p><strong>OLD Answers:</strong></p>

<p>For Windows editions of the <strong>64 bit</strong> variety - 64-bit Windows + Python used to require a separate installation method due to ez_setup, but I've tested the new distribute method on 64-bit Windows running 32-bit Python and 64-bit Python, and you can now use the same method for all versions of Windows/Python 2.7X:</p>

<p><strong>OLD Method 2</strong> using <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute" rel="noreferrer">distribute</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download <a href="http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py" rel="noreferrer">distribute</a> - I threw mine in <code>C:\Python27\Scripts</code> (feel free to create a <code>Scripts</code> directory if it doesn't exist.</li>
<li>Open up a command prompt (on Windows you should check out <a href="http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/" rel="noreferrer">conemu2</a> if you don't use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell" rel="noreferrer">PowerShell</a>) and change (<code>cd</code>) to the directory you've downloaded <code>distribute_setup.py</code> to.</li>
<li>Run distribute_setup: <code>python distribute_setup.py</code> (This will not work if your python installation directory is not added to your path - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/6318188/705198">go here for help</a>)</li>
<li>Change the current directory to the <code>Scripts</code> directory for your Python installation (<code>C:\Python27\Scripts</code>) or add that directory, as well as the Python base installation directory to your %PATH% environment variable.</li>
<li>Install pip using the newly installed setuptools: <code>easy_install pip</code></li>
</ol>

<p>The last step will not work unless you're either in the directory <code>easy_install.exe</code> is located in (C:\Python27\Scripts would be the default for Python 2.7), or you have that directory added to your path.</p>

<p><strong>OLD Method 1</strong> using ez_setup:</p>

<p><a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#windows" rel="noreferrer">from the setuptools page</a> --</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Download <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py" rel="noreferrer">ez_setup.py</a> and run it; it will download the appropriate .egg file and install it for you. (Currently, the provided .exe installer does not support 64-bit versions of Python for Windows, due to a distutils installer compatibility issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After this, you may continue with:</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Add <code>c:\Python2x\Scripts</code> to the Windows path (replace the <code>x</code> in <code>Python2x</code> with the actual version number you have installed)</li>
<li>Open a new (!) DOS prompt. From there run <code>easy_install pip</code></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>2016+ Update:</strong> </p>

<p>These answers are outdated or otherwise wordy and difficult.</p>

<p>If you've got Python 3.4+ or 2.7.9+, it will be <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/whatsnew/3.4.html#whatsnew-pep-453" rel="noreferrer">installed by default</a> on Windows.  Otherwise, in short:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the pip installer: 
<a href="https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" rel="noreferrer">https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py</a></li>
<li>If paranoid, inspect file to confirm it isn't malicious
(must b64 decode).</li>
<li>Open a console in the download folder as Admin and run
<code>get-pip.py</code>.  Alternatively, right-click its icon in Explorer and choose the "run as Admin...".</li>
</ol>

<p>The new binaries <code>pip.exe</code> (and the deprecated <code>easy_install.exe</code>) will be found in the <code>"%ProgramFiles%\PythonXX\Scripts"</code> folder (or similar), which is often not in your <code>PATH</code> variable.  I recommend adding it.</p>

<p>Python 3.4, which  was released in March 2014, comes with <code>pip</code> included:<br>
<a href="http://docs.python.org/3.4/whatsnew/3.4.html" rel="noreferrer">http://docs.python.org/3.4/whatsnew/3.4.html</a><br>
So, since the release of Python 3.4, the up-to-date way to install pip on Windows is to just install Python.</p>

<p>The recommended way to use it is to call it as a module, especially with multiple python distributions or versions installed, to guarantee packages go to the correct place:<br>
<code>python -m pip install --upgrade packageXYZ</code></p>

<p>When I have to use Windows, I use ActivePython, which automatically adds everything to your PATH and includes a package manager called <a href="http://code.activestate.com/pypm/" rel="noreferrer">PyPM</a> which provides <em>binary</em> package management making it faster and simpler to install packages.</p>

<p><code>pip</code> and <code>easy_install</code> aren't exactly the same thing, so there are some things you can get through <code>pip</code> but not <code>easy_install</code> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3220404/why-use-pip-over-easy-install/3224103#3224103">and vice versa</a>.</p>

<p>My recommendation is that you get <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads" rel="noreferrer">ActivePython Community Edition</a> and don't worry about the huge hassle of getting everything set up for Python on Windows. Then, you can just use <code>pypm</code>.</p>

<p>In case you want to use <code>pip</code> you have to check the <code>PyPM</code> option in the ActiveState installer. After installation you only need to logoff and log on again, and <code>pip</code> will be available on the commandline, because it is contained in the ActiveState installer <code>PyPM</code> option and the paths have been set by the installer for you already. <code>PyPM</code> will also be available, but you do not have to use it.</p>

<p><strong>Update March 2015</strong></p>

<p>Python 2.7.9 and later (on the Python 2 series), and Python 3.4 and later include pip by default, so you may have pip already.</p>

<p>If you don't, run this one line command on your prompt (which may require administrator access):</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">python -c <span class="hljs-string">"exec('try: from urllib2 import urlopen \nexcept: from urllib.request import urlopen');f=urlopen('https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py').read();exec(f)"</span>

<p>It will install <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/" rel="noreferrer">pip</a>. If <a href="https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/" rel="noreferrer">Setuptools</a> is not already installed, <code>get-pip.py</code> will install it for you too.</p>

<p>As mentioned in comments, the above command will download code from the Pip source code repository at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" rel="noreferrer">GitHub</a>, and dynamically run it at your environment. So be noticed that this is a shortcut of the steps download, inspect and run, <strong>all with a single command using Python itself</strong>. If you trust Pip, proceed without doubt.</p>

<p>Be sure that your Windows environment variable PATH includes Python's folders (for Python 2.7.x default install: <code>C:\Python27</code> and <code>C:\Python27\Scripts</code>, for Python 3.3x: <code>C:\Python33</code> and <code>C:\Python33\Scripts</code>, and so on).</p>

<h2>Installers</h2>

<p>I've built Windows installers for both <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute" rel="noreferrer">distribute</a> and <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/" rel="noreferrer">pip</a> here (the goal being to use <code>pip</code> without having to either bootstrap with <code>easy_install</code> or save and run Python scripts):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://download.sjsoft.com/opensource/distribute-0.6.27.win32.exe" rel="noreferrer">distribute-0.6.27.win32.exe</a></li>

</ul>

<p>On Windows, simply download and install first <code>distribute</code>, then <code>pip</code> from the above links. The <code>distribute</code> link above does contain stub <code>.exe</code> installers, and these are currently 32-bit only. I haven't tested the effect on 64-bit Windows.</p>

<p>The process to redo this for new versions is not difficult, and I've included it here for reference.</p>

<h3>Building <code>distribute</code></h3>

<p>In order to get the stub <code>.exe</code> files, you need to have a Visual C++ compiler (it is apparently compilable with MinGW as well)</p>

<p>Now, lets add the Python and pip into environment variable <em>path</em> settings
if you are on Windows, so that typing <code>pip</code> or <code>python</code> anywhere call
<code>python</code> or <code>pip</code> from where they are installed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, PIP is found under the folder in the above screen "<strong>SCRIPTS</strong>"
Let's add Python and PIP in the environment variable <em>path</em>.</p>

<p>To install pip <em>globally</em> on Python 2.x, easy_install appears to be the best solution as Adrián states.</p>

<p>However the <a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html" rel="noreferrer">installation instructions</a> for pip recommend using <a href="http://www.virtualenv.org" rel="noreferrer">virtualenv</a> since every virtualenv has pip installed in it automatically.  This does not require root access or modify your system Python installation.</p>

<p>Installing virtualenv still requires easy_install though.</p>

<p><em>2018 update:</em> </p>

<p>Python 3.3+ now includes the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" rel="noreferrer">venv module</a> for easily creating virtual environments like so:</p>

<p><code>python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment</code></p>

<p>See documentation for different platform methods of activating the environment after creation, but typically one of:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">$ source &lt;venv&gt;/<span class="hljs-built_in">bin</span>/activate

<p>To use pip, it is not mandatory that you need to install pip in the system directly. You can use it through <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv" rel="noreferrer"><code>virtualenv</code></a>. What you can do is follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download virtualenv tar.gz file from <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv" rel="noreferrer">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv</a></li>
<li>Unzip it with 7zip or some other tool</li>
</ul>

<p>We normally need to install Python packages for one particular project. So, now create a project folder, lets say myproject.</p>

<ul>
<li>Copy the <strong>virtualenv.py</strong> file from the decompressed folder of <code>virtualenv</code>, and paste inside the <strong>myproject</strong> folder</li>
</ul>

<p>Now create a virtual environment, lets say <strong>myvirtualenv</strong> as follows, inside the <strong>myproject</strong> folder:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">python virtualenv.py myvirtualenv
</code></pre>

<p>It will show you:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">New python executable <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> myvirtualenv\Scripts\python.exe
Installing setuptools....................................done.
Installing pip.........................done.
</code></pre>

<p>Now your virtual environment, <strong>myvirtualenv</strong>, is created inside your project folder. You might notice, pip is now installed inside you virtual environment. All you need to do is activate the virtual environment with the following command.</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">myvirtualenv\Scripts\activate
</code></pre>

<p>You will see the following at the command prompt:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">(myvirtualenv) PATH\TO\YOUR\PROJECT\FOLDER&gt;pip install package_name
</code></pre>

<p>Now you can start using pip, but make sure you have activated the virtualenv looking at the left of your prompt.</p>

<p>This is one of the easiest way to install pip i.e. inside virtual environment, but you need to have virtualenv.py file with you.</p>

<p><strong>Updated at 2016 :</strong> <code>Pip</code> should already be included in <code>Python 2.7.9+ or 3.4+</code>, but if for whatever reason it is not there, you can use the following one-liner.</p>

<ul>
<li>Download <a href="https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py" rel="noreferrer">https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py</a> and run it with Administrator permission <code>python get-pip.py</code> (If you are on Linux, use <code>sudo python get-pip.py</code>)</li>

<p>PS:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>This should already be satisfied in most cases but, if necessary, be sure that your environment variable PATH includes Python's folders (for example, <code>Python 2.7.x</code> on Windows default install: <code>C:\Python27 and C:\Python27\Scripts</code>, for <code>Python 3.3x</code>: <code>C:\Python33 and C:\Python33\Scripts</code>, etc)</p></li>

<p>I just wanted to add one more solution for those having issues installing setuptools from Windows 64-bit. The issue is discussed in this bug on python.org and is still unresolved as of the date of this comment. A simple workaround is mentioned and it works flawlessly. One registry change did the trick for me.</p>

<p>Link: <a href="http://bugs.python.org/issue6792#" rel="noreferrer">http://bugs.python.org/issue6792#</a></p>

<p>Solution that worked for me...:</p>

<p>Add this registry setting for 2.6+ versions of Python:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"> [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Python\PythonCore\<span class="hljs-number">2.6</span>\InstallPath]
<span class="hljs-meta"> @=<span class="hljs-string">"C:\\Python26\\"</span></span>
</code></pre>

<p>This is most likely the registry setting you will already have for Python 2.6+:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"> [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore\<span class="hljs-number">2.6</span>\InstallPath]
<span class="hljs-meta"> @=<span class="hljs-string">"C:\\Python26\\"</span></span>
</code></pre>

<p>Clearly, you will need to replace the 2.6 version with whatever version of Python you are running.</p>

<p>I had some issues installing in different ways when I followed instructions here. I think it's very tricky to install in every Windows environment in the same way. In my case I need Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3 in the same machine for different purposes so that's why I think there're more problems.
But the following instructions worked perfectly for me, so might be depending on your environment you should try this one:</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/" rel="noreferrer">http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/</a></p>

<p>Also, due to the different environments I found incredible useful to use Virtual Environments, I had websites that use different libraries and it's much better to encapsulate them into a single folder, check out the instructions, briefly if PIP is installed you just install VirtualEnv:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">pip install virtualenv
</code></pre>

<p>Into the folder you have all your files run</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">virtualenv venv
</code></pre>

<p>And seconds later you have a virtual environment with everything in venv folder, to activate it run venv/Scripts/activate.bat (deactivate the environment is easy, use deactivate.bat). Every library you install will end up in venv\Lib\site-packages and it's easy to move your whole environment somewhere.</p>

<p>The only downside I found is some code editors can't recognize this kind of environments, and you will see warnings in your code because imported libraries are not found. Of course there're tricky ways to do it but it would be nice editors keep in mind Virtual Environments are very normal nowadays.</p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>

<p>The problem is an issue with an old version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSSL" rel="nofollow">OpenSSL</a> being incompatible with pip 1.3.1 and above versions. The easy workaround for now, is to install pip 1.2.1, which does not require <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security" rel="nofollow">SSL</a>:</p>

<p>Installing Pip on Windows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download pip 1.2.1 from <a href="https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pip/pip-1.2.1.tar.gz" rel="nofollow">https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pip/pip-1.2.1.tar.gz</a></li>
<li>Extract the pip-1.2.1.tar.gz file</li>
<li>Change directory to the extracted folder: <code>cd &lt;path to extracted folder&gt;/pip-1.2.1</code></li>
<li>Run <code>python setup.py install</code></li>
<li>Now make sure <code>C:\Python27\Scripts</code> is in PATH because pip is installed in the <code>C:\Python27\Scripts</code> directory unlike <code>C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages</code> where Python packages are normally installed</li>
</ol>

<p>Now try to install any package using pip.</p>

<p>For example, to install the <code>requests</code> package using pip, run this from cmd:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">pip install requests
</code></pre>

<p>Whola! <code>requests</code> will be successfully installed and you will get a success message.</p>

<p>I think the question makes it seem like the answer is simpler than it really is.</p>
<p>Running of pip will sometimes require native compilation of a module (64-bit NumPy is a common example of that). In order for pip's compilation to succeed, you need Python which was compiled with the same version of Microsoft Visual C++ as the one pip is using.</p>
<p>Standard Python distributions are compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 2008. You can install an Express version of Microsoft Visual C++ 2008, but it is not maintained. Your best bet is to get an express version of a later Microsoft Visual C++ and compile Python. Then PIP and Python will be using the same Microsoft Visual C++ version.</p>
