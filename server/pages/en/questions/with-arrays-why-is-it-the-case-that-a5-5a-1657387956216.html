(Integer + integer is a different operation, and pointer + pointer is nonsense.)\n\nThe C standard&apos;s description of the + operator (N1570 6.5.6) says:\n\n\n  For addition, either both operands shall have arithmetic type, or one\n  operand shall be a pointer to a complete object type and the other\n  shall have integer type.\n\n\nIt could just as easily have said:\n\n\n  For addition, either both operands shall have arithmetic type, or the left\n  operand shall be a pointer to a complete object type and the right operand\n  shall have integer type.\n\n\nin which case both i + p and i[p] would be illegal.\n\nIn C++ terms, we really have two sets of overloaded + operators, which can be loosely described as:\n\npointer operator+(pointer p, integer i);\n\n\nand\n\npointer operator+(integer i, pointer p);\n\n\nof which only the first is really necessary.\n\nSo why is it this way?\n\nC++ inherited this definition from C, which got it from B (the commutativity of array indexing is explicitly mentioned in the 1972 Users&apos; Reference to B), which got it from BCPL (manual dated 1967), which may well have gotten it from even earlier languages (CPL? Algol?).\n\nSo the idea that array indexing is defined in terms of addition, and that addition, even of a pointer and an integer, is commutative, goes back many decades, to C&apos;s ancestor languages.\n\nThose languages were much less strongly typed than modern C is. In particular, the distinction between pointers and integers was often ignored. (Early C programmers sometimes used pointers as unsigned integers, before the unsigned keyword was added to the language.) So the idea of making addition non-commutative because the operands are of different types probably wouldn&apos;t have occurred to the designers of those languages. If a user wanted to add two &quot;things&quot;, whether those &quot;things&quot; are integers, pointers, or something else, it wasn&apos;t up to the language to prevent it.\n\nAnd over the years, any change to that rule would have broken existing code (though the 1989 ANSI C standard might have been a good opportunity).\n\nChanging C and/or C++ to require putting the pointer on the left and the integer on the right might break some existing code, but there would be no loss of real expressive power.\n\nSo now we have arr[3] and 3[arr] meaning exactly the same thing, though the latter form should never appear outside the IOCCC.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"And, of course\n\n (&quot;ABCD&quot;[2] == 2[&quot;ABCD&quot;]) &amp;&amp; (2[&quot;ABCD&quot;] == &apos;C&apos;) &amp;&amp; (&quot;ABCD&quot;[2] == &apos;C&apos;)\n\n\nThe main reason for this was that back in the 70&apos;s when C was designed, computers didn&apos;t have much memory (64KB was a lot), so the C compiler didn&apos;t do much syntax checking.  Hence &quot;X[Y]&quot; was rather blindly translated into &quot;*(X+Y)&quot;  \n\nThis also explains the &quot;+=&quot; and &quot;++&quot; syntaxes.  Everything in the form &quot;A = B + C&quot; had the same compiled form.  But, if B was the same object as A, then an assembly level optimization was available.  But the compiler wasn&apos;t bright enough to recognize it, so the developer had to (A += C).   Similarly, if C was 1, a different assembly level optimization was available, and again the developer had to make it explicit, because the compiler didn&apos;t recognize it.

Among other languages, BCPL had a fairly major influence on C&apos;s early development.  If you declared an array in BCPL with something like:\n\nlet V = vec 10\n\n\nthat actually allocated 11 words of memory, not 10.  Typically V was the first, and contained the address of the immediately following word.  So unlike C, naming V went to that location and picked up the address of the zeroeth element of the array.  Therefore array indirection in BCPL, expressed as\n\nlet J = V!5\n\n\nreally did have to do J = !(V + 5) (using BCPL syntax) since it was necessary to fetch V to get the base address of the array.  Thus V!5 and 5!V were synonymous.  As an anecdotal observation, WAFL (Warwick Functional Language) was written in BCPL, and to the best of my memory tended to use the latter syntax rather than the former for accessing the nodes used as data storage.  Granted this is from somewhere between 35 and 40 years ago, so my memory is a little rusty. :)\n\nThe innovation of dispensing with the extra word of storage and having the compiler insert the base address of the array when it was named came later.  According to the C history paper this happened at about the time structures were added to C.\n\nNote that ! in BCPL was both a unary prefix operator and a binary infix operator, in both cases doing indirection. just that the binary form included an addition of the two operands before doing the indirection.  Given the word oriented nature of BCPL (and B) this actually made a lot of sense.  The restriction of &quot;pointer and integer&quot; was made necessary in C when it gained data types, and sizeof became a thing.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution15","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Well, this is a feature that is only possible because of the language support.\n\nThe compiler interprets a[i] as *(a+i) and the expression 5[a] evaluates to *(5+a).

<p>I think something is being missed by the other answers.</p>

<p>Yes, <code>p[i]</code> is by definition equivalent to <code>*(p+i)</code>, which (because addition is commutative) is equivalent to <code>*(i+p)</code>, which (again, by the definition of the <code>[]</code> operator) is equivalent to <code>i[p]</code>.</p>

<p>(And in <code>array[i]</code>, the array name is implicitly converted to a pointer to the array's first element.)</p>

<p>But the commutativity of addition is not all that obvious in this case.</p>

<p>When both operands are of the same type, or even of different numeric types that are promoted to a common type, commutativity makes perfect sense: <code>x + y == y + x</code>.</p>

<p>But in this case we're talking specifically about pointer arithmetic, where one operand is a pointer and the other is an integer. (Integer + integer is a different operation, and pointer + pointer is nonsense.)</p>

<p>The C standard's description of the <code>+</code> operator (<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf">N1570</a> 6.5.6) says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For addition, either both operands shall have arithmetic type, or one
  operand shall be a pointer to a complete object type and the other
  shall have integer type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It could just as easily have said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For addition, either both operands shall have arithmetic type, or <em>the left</em>
  operand shall be a pointer to a complete object type and the <em>right operand</em>
  shall have integer type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>in which case both <code>i + p</code> and <code>i[p]</code> would be illegal.</p>

<p>In C++ terms, we really have two sets of overloaded <code>+</code> operators, which can be loosely described as:</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c">pointer operator+(pointer p, integer i);
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c">pointer operator+(integer i, pointer p);
</code></pre>

<p>of which only the first is really necessary.</p>

<p>So why is it this way?</p>

<p>C++ inherited this definition from C, which got it from B (the commutativity of array indexing is explicitly mentioned in the 1972 <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/kbman.html">Users' Reference to B</a>), which got it from <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/bcpl.html">BCPL</a> (manual dated 1967), which may well have gotten it from even earlier languages (CPL? Algol?).</p>

<p>So the idea that array indexing is defined in terms of addition, and that addition, even of a pointer and an integer, is commutative, goes back many decades, to C's ancestor languages.</p>

<p>Those languages were much less strongly typed than modern C is. In particular, the distinction between pointers and integers was often ignored. (Early C programmers sometimes used pointers as unsigned integers, before the <code>unsigned</code> keyword was added to the language.) So the idea of making addition non-commutative because the operands are of different types probably wouldn't have occurred to the designers of those languages. If a user wanted to add two "things", whether those "things" are integers, pointers, or something else, it wasn't up to the language to prevent it.</p>

<p>And over the years, any change to that rule would have broken existing code (though the 1989 ANSI C standard might have been a good opportunity).</p>

<p>Changing C and/or C++ to require putting the pointer on the left and the integer on the right might break some existing code, but there would be no loss of real expressive power.</p>

<p>So now we have <code>arr[3]</code> and <code>3[arr]</code> meaning exactly the same thing, though the latter form should never appear outside the <a href="http://ioccc.org/">IOCCC</a>.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The main reason for this was that back in the 70's when C was designed, computers didn't have much memory (64KB was a lot), so the C compiler didn't do much syntax checking.  Hence "<code>X[Y]</code>" was rather blindly translated into "<code>*(X+Y)</code>"  </p>

<p>This also explains the "<code>+=</code>" and "<code>++</code>" syntaxes.  Everything in the form "<code>A = B + C</code>" had the same compiled form.  But, if B was the same object as A, then an assembly level optimization was available.  But the compiler wasn't bright enough to recognize it, so the developer had to (<code>A += C</code>).   Similarly, if <code>C</code> was <code>1</code>, a different assembly level optimization was available, and again the developer had to make it explicit, because the compiler didn't recognize it.   (More recently compilers do, so those syntaxes are largely unnecessary these days)</p>

<p>It has very good explanation in <em>A TUTORIAL ON POINTERS AND ARRAYS IN C</em>
by Ted Jensen.</p>

<p>Ted Jensen explained it as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In fact, this is true, i.e wherever one writes <code>a[i]</code> it can be
  replaced with <code>*(a + i)</code>  without any problems. In fact, the compiler
  will create the same code in either case. Thus we see that pointer
  arithmetic is the same thing as array indexing. Either syntax produces
  the same result.</p>
  
  <p>This is NOT saying that pointers and arrays
  are the same thing, they are not. We are only saying that to identify
  a given element of an array we have the choice of two syntaxes, one
  using array indexing and the other using pointer arithmetic, which
  yield identical results.</p>
  
  <p>Now, looking at this last
  expression, part of it.. <code>(a + i)</code>, is a simple addition using the +
  operator and the rules of C state that such an expression is
  commutative. That is (a + i) is identical to <code>(i + a)</code>. Thus we could
  write <code>*(i + a)</code> just as easily as <code>*(a + i)</code>.
  But <code>*(i + a)</code> could have come from <code>i[a]</code> ! From all of this comes the curious
  truth that if:</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-type">char</span> a[<span class="hljs-number">20</span>];
</code></pre>
  
  <p>writing</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c">a[<span class="hljs-number">3</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">'x'</span>;
</code></pre>
  
  <p>is the same as writing</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-number">3</span>[a] = <span class="hljs-string">'x'</span>;

<p>I know the question is answered, but I couldn't resist sharing this explanation.</p>

<p>I remember Principles of Compiler design,
Let's assume <code>a</code> is an <code>int</code> array and size of <code>int</code> is 2 bytes,
&amp; Base address for <code>a</code> is 1000.</p>

<p>How <code>a[5]</code> will work -&gt;</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c">Base Address of your Array a + (<span class="hljs-number">5</span>*size of(data type <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">array</span> a))
i.e. <span class="hljs-number">1000</span> + (<span class="hljs-number">5</span>*<span class="hljs-number">2</span>) = <span class="hljs-number">1010</span>
</code></pre>

<p>So, </p>

<p>Similarly when the c code is broken down into 3-address code, 
<code>5[a]</code> will become -&gt;</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c">Base Address of your Array a + (size of(data type <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">array</span> a)*<span class="hljs-number">5</span>)
i.e. <span class="hljs-number">1000</span> + (<span class="hljs-number">2</span>*<span class="hljs-number">5</span>) = <span class="hljs-number">1010</span> 
</code></pre>

<p>So basically both the statements are pointing to the same location in memory and hence, <code>a[5] = 5[a]</code>.</p>

<p>This explanation is also the reason why negative indexes in arrays work in C.</p>

<p>i.e. if I access <code>a[-5]</code> it will give me</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c">Base Address of your Array a + (<span class="hljs-number">-5</span> * size of(data type <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">array</span> a))
i.e. <span class="hljs-number">1000</span> + (<span class="hljs-number">-5</span>*<span class="hljs-number">2</span>) = <span class="hljs-number">990</span>
</code></pre>

<p>It will return me object at location 990.</p>

<p>In C arrays, <code>arr[3]</code> and <code>3[arr]</code> are the same, and their equivalent pointer notations are <code>*(arr + 3)</code> to <code>*(3 + arr)</code>.

<p>A little bit of history now.  Among other languages, BCPL had a fairly major influence on C's early development.  If you declared an array in BCPL with something like:</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c">let V = vec <span class="hljs-number">10</span>
</code></pre>

<p>that actually allocated 11 words of memory, not 10.  Typically V was the first, and contained the address of the immediately following word.  So unlike C, naming V went to that location and picked up the address of the zeroeth element of the array.  Therefore array indirection in BCPL, expressed as</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c">let J = V!<span class="hljs-number">5</span>
</code></pre>

<p>really did have to do <code>J = !(V + 5)</code> (using BCPL syntax) since it was necessary to fetch V to get the base address of the array.  Thus <code>V!5</code> and <code>5!V</code> were synonymous.  As an anecdotal observation, WAFL (Warwick Functional Language) was written in BCPL, and to the best of my memory tended to use the latter syntax rather than the former for accessing the nodes used as data storage.  Granted this is from somewhere between 35 and 40 years ago, so my memory is a little rusty. :)</p>

<p>The innovation of dispensing with the extra word of storage and having the compiler insert the base address of the array when it was named came later.  According to the C history paper this happened at about the time structures were added to C.</p>

<p>Note that <code>!</code> in BCPL was both a unary prefix operator and a binary infix operator, in both cases doing indirection. just that the binary form included an addition of the two operands before doing the indirection.  Given the word oriented nature of BCPL (and B) this actually made a lot of sense.  The restriction of "pointer and integer" was made necessary in C when it gained data types, and <code>sizeof</code> became a thing.</p>

<p>Well, this is a feature that is only possible because of the language support.</p>

<p>The compiler interprets <code>a[i]</code> as <code>*(a+i)</code> and the expression <code>5[a]</code> evaluates to <code>*(5+a)</code>. Since addition is commutative it turns out that both are equal. Hence the expression evaluates to <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>Incidentally, C++ has a similar commutative property for function calls. Rather than writing <code>g(f(x))</code> as you must in C, you may use member functions to write <code>x.f().g()</code>. Replace f and g with lookup tables and you can write <code>g[f[x]]</code> (functional style) or <code>(x[f])[g]</code> (oop style). The latter gets really nice with structs containing indices: <code>x[xs].y[ys].z[zs]</code>. Using the more common notation that's <code>zs[ys[xs[x].y].z]</code>.</p>

Algol?).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So the idea that array indexing is defined in terms of addition, and that addition, even of a pointer and an integer, is commutative, goes back many decades, to C\u0026apos;s ancestor languages.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Those languages were much less strongly typed than modern C is. In particular, the distinction between pointers and integers was often ignored. (Early C programmers sometimes used pointers as unsigned integers, before the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;unsigned\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; keyword was added to the language.) So the idea of making addition non-commutative because the operands are of different types probably wouldn\u0026apos;t have occurred to the designers of those languages. If a user wanted to add two \u0026quot;things\u0026quot;, whether those \u0026quot;things\u0026quot; are integers, pointers, or something else, it wasn\u0026apos;t up to the language to prevent it.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;And over the years, any change to that rule would have broken existing code (though the 1989 ANSI C standard might have been a good opportunity).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Changing C and/or C++ to require putting the pointer on the left and the integer on the right might break some existing code, but there would be no loss of real expressive power.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So now we have \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;arr[3]\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;3[arr]\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; meaning exactly the same thing, though the latter form should never appear outside the \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://ioccc.org/\u0026quot;\u0026gt;IOCCC\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;And, of course\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-c s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-c\u0026quot;\u0026gt; (\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;ABCD\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;[\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-number\u0026quot;\u0026gt;2\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;] == \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-number\u0026quot;\u0026gt;2\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;[\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;ABCD\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;]) \u0026amp;amp;\u0026amp;amp; (\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-number\u0026quot;\u0026gt;2\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;[\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;ABCD\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;] == \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026apos;C\u0026apos;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;) \u0026amp;amp;\u0026amp;amp; (\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;ABCD\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;[\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-number\u0026quot;\u0026gt;2\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;] == \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026apos;C\u0026apos;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;)\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The main reason for this was that back in the 70\u0026apos;s when C was designed, computers didn\u0026apos;t have much memory (64KB was a lot), so the C compiler didn\u0026apos;t do much syntax checking.

Therefore array indirection in BCPL, expressed as\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-c s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-c\u0026quot;\u0026gt;let J = V!\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-number\u0026quot;\u0026gt;5\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;really did have to do \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;J = !(V + 5)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; (using BCPL syntax) since it was necessary to fetch V to get the base address of the array.  Thus \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;V!5\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;5!V\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; were synonymous.  As an anecdotal observation, WAFL (Warwick Functional Language) was written in BCPL, and to the best of my memory tended to use the latter syntax rather than the former for accessing the nodes used as data storage.  Granted this is from somewhere between 35 and 40 years ago, so my memory is a little rusty. :)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The innovation of dispensing with the extra word of storage and having the compiler insert the base address of the array when it was named came later.  According to the C history paper this happened at about the time structures were added to C.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Note that \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;!\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; in BCPL was both a unary prefix operator and a binary infix operator, in both cases doing indirection. just that the binary form included an addition of the two operands before doing the indirection.  Given the word oriented nature of BCPL (and B) this actually made a lot of sense.  The restriction of \u0026quot;pointer and integer\u0026quot; was made necessary in C when it gained data types, and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;sizeof\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; became a thing.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Well, this is a feature that is only possible because of the language support.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The compiler interprets \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;a[i]\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; as \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;*(a+i)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and the expression \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;5[a]\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; evaluates to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;*(5+a)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. Since addition is commutative it turns out that both are equal. Hence the expression evaluates to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;true\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In C\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-c s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-c\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-type\u0026quot;\u0026gt;int\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; a[]={\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-number\u0026quot;\u0026gt;10\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-number\u0026quot;\u0026gt;20\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-number\u0026quot;\u0026gt;30\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-number\u0026quot;\u0026gt;40\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-number\u0026quot;\u0026gt;50\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;};\n \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-type\u0026quot;\u0026gt;int\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; *p=a;\n \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;printf\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;%d\\n\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;,*p++);\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-comment\u0026quot;\u0026gt;//output will be 10\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;printf\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;%d\\n\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;,*a++);\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-comment\u0026quot;\u0026gt;//will give an error\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Pointer \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;p\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is a \u0026quot;variable\u0026quot;, array name \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;a\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is a \u0026quot;mnemonic\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;synonym\u0026quot;,\nso \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;p++\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is valid but \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;a++\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is invalid.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;a[2]\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is equals to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;2[a]\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; because the internal operation on both of this is \u0026quot;Pointer Arithmetic\u0026quot; internally calculated as \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;*(a+2)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; equals \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;*(2+a)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Because C compiler always convert array notation in pointer notation.\n\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;a[5] = *(a + 5)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;  also \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;5[a] = *(5 + a) = *(a + 5)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\nSo, both are equal.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Because it\u0026apos;s useful to avoid confusing nesting.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Would you rather read this:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-c s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-c\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;array\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;[\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;array\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;[head].next].prev\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;or this:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-c s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-c\u0026quot;\u0026gt;head[\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;array\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;].next[\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;array\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;].prev\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Incidentally, C++ has a similar commutative property for function calls.
