JLS) which naturally cannot represent the a floating point value such as 0.333333...\n&quot;Integer division rounds toward 0.&quot; 15.17.2 JLS\n\nWhy double g = 1.0/3.0; and  double g = ((double) 1) / 3; work?\nFrom Chapter 5. Conversions and Promotions one can read:\n\nOne conversion context is the operand of a numeric operator such as +\nor *. The conversion process for such operands is called numeric\npromotion. Promotion is special in that, in the case of binary\noperators, the conversion chosen for one operand may depend in part on\nthe type of the other operand expression.\n\nand 5.6.2. Binary Numeric Promotion\n\nWhen an operator applies binary numeric promotion to a pair of\noperands, each of which must denote a value that is convertible to a\nnumeric type, the following rules apply, in order:\nIf any operand is of a reference type, it is subjected to unboxing\nconversion (§5.1.8).\nWidening primitive conversion (§5.1.2) is applied to convert either or\nboth operands as specified by the following rules:\nIf either operand is of type double, the other is converted to double.\nOtherwise, if either operand is of type float, the other is converted\nto float.\nOtherwise, if either operand is of type long, the other is converted\nto long.\nOtherwise, both operands are converted to type int.\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution6","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"you should use\n\ndouble g=1.0/3;\n\n\nor\n\ndouble g=1/3.0;\n\n\nInteger division returns integer.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution7","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Because it treats 1 and 3 as integers, therefore rounding the result down to 0, so that it is an integer.\n\nTo get the result you are looking for, explicitly tell java that the numbers are doubles like so:\n\ndouble g = 1.0/3.0;\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution8","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Make the 1 a float and float division will be used\n\npublic static void main(String d[]){\n    double g=1f/3;\n    System.out.printf(&quot;%.2f&quot;,g);\n}\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution9","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"The conversion in JAVA is quite simple but need some understanding. As explain in the JLS for integer operations:\n\n\n  If an integer operator other than a shift operator has at least one operand of type long, then the operation is carried out using 64-bit precision, and the result of the numerical operator is of type long. If the other operand is not long, it is first widened (§5.1.5) to type long by numeric promotion (§5.6). \n\n\nAnd an example is always the best way to translate the JLS ;) \n\nint + long -&gt; long\nint(1) + long(2) + int(3) -&gt; long(1+2) + long(3)\n\n\n\n  Otherwise, the operation is carried out using 32-bit precision, and the result of the numerical operator is of type int. If either operand is not an int, it is first widened to type int by numeric promotion. \n\n\nshort + int -&gt; int + int -&gt; int\n\n\nA small example using Eclipse to show that even an addition of two shorts will not be that easy :\n\nshort s = 1;\ns = s + s; &lt;- Compiling error\n\n//possible loss of precision\n//  required: short\n//  found:    int\n\n\nThis will required a casting with a possible loss of precision.\n\nThe same is true for the floating point operators\n\n\n  If at least one of the operands to a numerical operator is of type double, then the operation is carried out using 64-bit floating-point arithmetic, and the result of the numerical operator is a value of type double. If the other operand is not a double, it is first widened (§5.1.5) to type double by numeric promotion (§5.6). \n\n\nSo the promotion is done on the float into double.\n\nAnd the mix of both integer and floating value result in floating values as said \n\n\n  If at least one of the operands to a binary operator is of floating-point type, then the operation is a floating-point operation, even if the other is integral. \n\n\nThis is true for binary operators but not for &quot;Assignment Operators&quot; like +=\n\nA simple working example is enough to prove this\n\nint i = 1;\ni += 1.5f;\n\n\nThe reason is that there is an implicit cast done here, this will be execute like \n\ni = (int) i + 1.5f\ni = (int) 2.5f\ni = 2\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution10","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"1 and 3 are integer contants and so Java does an integer division which&apos;s result is 0.

<p>One conversion context is the operand of a numeric operator such as +
or *. The conversion process for such operands is called numeric
promotion. Promotion is special in that, in the case of binary
operators, the conversion chosen for one operand may depend in part on
the type of the other operand expression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and <code>5.6.2. Binary Numeric Promotion</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When an operator applies binary numeric promotion to a pair of
operands, each of which must denote a value that is convertible to a
numeric type, the following rules apply, in order:</p>
<p>If any operand is of a reference type, it is subjected to unboxing
conversion (§5.1.8).</p>
<p>Widening primitive conversion (§5.1.2) is applied to convert either or
both operands as specified by the following rules:</p>
<p><strong>If either operand is of type double, the other is converted to double.</strong></p>
<p>Otherwise, if either operand is of type float, the other is converted
to float.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if either operand is of type long, the other is converted
to long.</p>
<p>Otherwise, both operands are converted to type int.</p>

<p>The conversion in JAVA is quite simple but need some understanding. As explain in the JLS for <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.2.2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">integer operations</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If an integer operator other than a shift operator has at least one operand of type long, then the operation is carried out using 64-bit precision, and the result of the numerical operator is of type long.

<p>And an example is always the best way to translate the JLS ;) </p>

<blockquote>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">short</span> + <span class="hljs-type">int</span> -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">int</span> + <span class="hljs-type">int</span> -&gt; <span class="hljs-type">int</span>

<p>A small example using Eclipse to show that even an addition of two <code>short</code>s will not be that easy :</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">short</span> <span class="hljs-variable">s</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;

<span class="hljs-comment">//possible loss of precision</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">//  required: short</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">//  found:    int</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This will required a casting with a possible loss of precision.</p>

<p>The same is true for the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.2.4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">floating point operators</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If at least one of the operands to a numerical operator is of type double, then the operation is carried out using 64-bit floating-point arithmetic, and the result of the numerical operator is a value of type double. If the other operand is not a double, it is first widened (§5.1.5) to type double by numeric promotion (§5.6). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the promotion is done on the float into double.</p>

<p>And the mix of both integer and floating value result in floating values as said </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If at least one of the operands to a binary operator is of floating-point type, then the operation is a floating-point operation, even if the other is integral. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is true for binary operators but not for "Assignment Operators" like <code>+=</code></p>

<p>A simple working example is enough to prove this</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">i</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
i += <span class="hljs-number">1.5f</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>The reason is that there is an implicit cast done here, this will be execute like </p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">i = (<span class="hljs-type">int</span>) i + <span class="hljs-number">1.5f</span>

<p>Since both 1 and 3 are ints the result not rounded but it's truncated. So you ignore fractions and take only wholes.</p>

<p>To avoid this have at least one of your numbers 1 or 3 as a decimal form 1.0 and/or 3.0.</p>

<p>Many others have failed to point out the real issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An operation on only integers casts the result of the operation to an integer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This necessarily means that floating point results, that <em>could</em> be displayed as an integer, will be truncated (lop off the decimal part).</p>

<p>What is <em>casting</em> (typecasting / type conversion) you ask?</p>

<p>It varies on the implementation of the language, but Wikipedia has a fairly comprehensive view, and it does talk about <em>coercion</em> as well, which is a pivotal piece of information in answering your question.</p>
