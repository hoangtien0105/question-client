What exactly is the function of the var keyword in JavaScript, and what is the difference between

var someNumber = 2;
var someFunction = function() { doSomething; }
var someObject = { }
var someObject.someProperty = 5;


and

someNumber = 2;
someFunction = function() { doSomething; }
someObject = { }
someObject.someProperty = 5;


?

When would you use either one, and why/what does it do?

If the declaration appears in a function - a local variable is declared; if it&apos;s in global scope - a global variable is declared.\n\nx = 1, on the other hand, is merely a property assignment. It first tries to resolve x against scope chain. If it finds it anywhere in that scope chain, it performs assignment; if it doesn&apos;t find x, only then does it creates x property on a global object (which is a top level object in a scope chain). \n\nNow, notice that it doesn&apos;t declare a global variable, it creates a global property.\n\nThe difference between the two is subtle and might be confusing unless you understand that variable declarations also create properties (only on a Variable Object) and that every property in Javascript (well, ECMAScript) have certain flags that describe their properties - ReadOnly, DontEnum and DontDelete.\n\nSince variable declaration creates property with the DontDelete flag, the difference between var x = 1 and x = 1 (when executed in global scope) is that the former one - variable declaration - creates the DontDelete&apos;able property, and latter one doesn&apos;t. As a consequence, the property created via this implicit assignment can then be deleted from the global object, and the former one - the one created via variable declaration - cannot be deleted.\n\nBut this is just theory of course, and in practice there are even more differences between the two, due to various bugs in implementations (such as those from IE).\n\nHope it all makes sense : )\n\n\n\n[Update 2010/12/16]\n\nIn ES5 (ECMAScript 5; recently standardized, 5th edition of the language) there&apos;s a so-called &quot;strict mode&quot;  an opt-in language mode, which slightly changes the behavior of undeclared assignments. In strict mode, assignment to an undeclared identifier is a ReferenceError. The rationale for this was to catch accidental assignments, preventing creation of undesired global properties. Some of the newer browsers have already started rolling support for strict mode.

<p>If you're in the global scope then there's not much difference. Read <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1471738/1541051">Kangax's</a> answer for explanation</p>

<p>If you're in a function then <strong><code>var</code></strong> will create a local variable, "no var" will look up the scope chain until it finds the variable or hits the global scope (at which point it will create it):</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// These are both globals</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> foo = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
bar = <span class="hljs-number">2</span>;

<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>)
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> foo = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// Local</span>
    bar = <span class="hljs-number">2</span>;     <span class="hljs-comment">// Global</span>

    <span class="hljs-comment">// Execute an anonymous function</span>
    (<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>)
    {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> wibble = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// Local</span>
        foo = <span class="hljs-number">2</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// Inherits from scope above (creating a closure)</span>
        moo = <span class="hljs-number">3</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// Global</span>
    }())
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you're not doing an assignment then you need to use <code>var</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> x; <span class="hljs-comment">// Declare x</span>
</code></pre>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution2" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl solution-inner border md:px-10 md:py-10 px-2 py-10 shadow-md bg-white"><div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-between"><h4 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 2</h4><div class="tags-wrap h-max space-x-8"><div class="tags"><a class="rounded-2xl border bg-neutral-100 px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold whitespace-nowrap" href="/questions/tag/keyword">keyword</a><a class="rounded-2xl border bg-neutral-100 px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold whitespace-nowrap" href="/questions/tag/ecmascript-5">ecmascript-5</a></div></div></div><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p><strong>There's a difference</strong>.</p>

<p><code>var x = 1</code> <strong>declares variable</strong> <code>x</code> in current scope (aka execution context). If the declaration appears in a function - a local variable is declared; if it's in global scope - a global variable is declared.</p>

<p><code>x = 1</code>, on the other hand, is merely a property assignment. It first tries to resolve <code>x</code> against scope chain. If it finds it anywhere in that scope chain, it performs assignment; if it doesn't find <code>x</code>, only then does <strong>it creates <code>x</code> property on a global object</strong> (which is a top level object in a scope chain). </p>

<p>Now, notice that it doesn't declare a global variable, it creates a global property.</p>

<p>The difference between the two is subtle and might be confusing unless you understand that <strong>variable declarations also create properties</strong> (only on a Variable Object) and that every property in Javascript (well, ECMAScript) have certain flags that describe their properties - ReadOnly, DontEnum and DontDelete.</p>

<p>Since variable declaration creates property with the DontDelete flag, the difference between <code>var x = 1</code> and <code>x = 1</code> (when executed in global scope) is that the former one - variable declaration - creates the DontDelete'able property, and latter one doesn't. As a consequence, the property created via this implicit assignment can then be deleted from the global object, and the former one - the one created via variable declaration - cannot be deleted.</p>

<p>But this is just theory of course, and <strong>in practice there are even more differences between the two</strong>, due to various bugs in implementations (such as those from IE).</p>

<p>Hope it all makes sense : )</p>

<p><strong>[Update 2010/12/16]</strong></p>

<p>In ES5 (ECMAScript 5; recently standardized, 5th edition of the language) there's a so-called "strict mode"  an opt-in language mode, which slightly changes the behavior of undeclared assignments. In strict mode, assignment to an undeclared identifier is a <strong>ReferenceError</strong>. The rationale for this was to catch accidental assignments, preventing creation of undesired global properties. Some of the newer browsers have already started rolling support for strict mode. See, for example, <a href="http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table" rel="noreferrer">my compat table</a>.</p>

<p>Saying it's the difference between "<strong>local</strong> and <strong>global</strong>" isn't entirely accurate.</p>

<p>When Javascript is executed in a browser, all your code is surrounded by a with statement, like so:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> (<span class="hljs-variable language_">window</span>) {

<p>More info on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Statements/with" rel="noreferrer"><code>with</code> - MDN</a></p>

<p>Since <code>var</code> declares a variable <em>in the current scope</em> , there is no difference between declaring <code>var</code> <strong>inside window</strong> and not declaring it at all.</p>

<p>The difference comes when you're not directly inside the window, e.g. inside a function or inside a block.</p>

<p>Using <code>var</code> lets you hide external variables that have the same name. In this way you can simulate a "private" variable, but that's another topic.</p>

<p>A rule of thumb is to always use <code>var</code>, because otherwise you run the risk of introducing subtle bugs.</p>

<p>EDIT:
After the critiques I received, I would like to emphasize the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>var</code> declares a variable <em>in the current scope</em></li>
<li>The global scope is <code>window</code></li>
<li>Not using <code>var</code> implicitly declares <code>var</code> in the global scope (window)</li>
<li>Declaring a variable in the global scope (window) using <code>var</code> is the same as omitting it.</li>
<li>Declaring a variable in scopes different from window using <code>var</code> <strong>is not the same thing</strong> as declaring a variable without <code>var</code></li>
<li>Always declare <code>var</code> explicitly because it's good practice</li>

<p>Always use the <code>var</code> keyword to declare variables. Why? Good coding practice should be enough of a reason in itself, but omitting it means it is declared in the <strong>global</strong> scope (a variable like this is called an "implied" global). Douglas Crockford <a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html#variable%20declarations" rel="noreferrer">recommends never using implied globals</a>, and according to the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/ScriptingAutomation/Conceptual/JSCodingGuide/Advanced/Advanced.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006541" rel="noreferrer">Apple JavaScript Coding Guidelines</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any variable created without the <code>var</code>
  keyword is created at the global scope
  and is not garbage collected when the
  function returns (because it doesnt
  go out of scope), presenting the
  opportunity for a memory leak.</p>

<p>If you do not use <strong><code>var</code></strong> to declare a variable, the variable will be in global scope.</p>

<p>For more information, you can search "scope chain JavaScript" in Google.</p>

<h1>Don't use <code>var</code>!</h1>
<p><code>var</code> was the pre-ES6 way to declare a variable. We are now <em>in the future</em>, and you should be coding as such.</p>
<h2>Use <code>const</code> and <code>let</code></h2>
<p><code>const</code> should be used for ~95% of cases. It makes it so the variable reference can't change, thus array, object, and DOM node properties can change and should likely be <code>const</code>.</p>
<p><code>let</code> should be be used for any variable expecting to be reassigned. This includes within a for loop. If you ever write <code>varName =</code> beyond the initialization, use <code>let</code>.</p>
<p>Both have block level scoping, as expected in most other languages.</p>

<p>@Chris S gave a nice example showcasing the practical difference (and danger) between <code>var</code> and no <code>var</code>. Here's another one, I find this one particularly dangerous because the difference is only visible in an asynchronous environment so it can easily slip by during testing.</p>

<p>As you'd expect the following snippet outputs <code>["text"]</code>:</p>

<p></p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">var_fun</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> array = []
  array.<span class="hljs-title function_">push</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'text'</span>)
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> array
}

<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-title function_">var_fun</span>())</code></pre>
<div class="snippet-result"><div class="snippet-ctas"><button type="button" class="s-btn s-btn__primary"><span class="icon-play-white _hover"></span><span> Run code snippet</span></button><input class="copySnippet s-btn s-btn__filled" type="button" value="Copy snippet to answer" style="display: none;"><button type="button" class="s-btn hideResults" style="display: none;">Hide results</button><div class="popout-code"><a class="snippet-expand-link">Expand snippet</a></div></div><div class="snippet-result-code" style="display: none;"><iframe name="sif1" sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-scripts" class="snippet-box-edit snippet-box-result" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></div></div>
</div>
<p></p>

<p>So does the following snippet (note the missing <code>let</code> before <code>array</code>):</p>

<p></p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">var_fun</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
  array = []
  array.<span class="hljs-title function_">push</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'text'</span>)
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> array
}

<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-title function_">var_fun</span>())</code></pre>
<div class="snippet-result"><div class="snippet-ctas"><button type="button" class="s-btn s-btn__primary"><span class="icon-play-white _hover"></span><span> Run code snippet</span></button><input class="copySnippet s-btn s-btn__filled" type="button" value="Copy snippet to answer" style="display: none;"><button type="button" class="s-btn hideResults" style="display: none;">Hide results</button><div class="popout-code"><a class="snippet-expand-link">Expand snippet</a></div></div><div class="snippet-result-code" style="display: none;"><iframe name="sif2" sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-scripts" class="snippet-box-edit snippet-box-result" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></div></div>
</div>
<p></p>

<p>Executing the data manipulation asynchronously still produces the same result with a single executor:</p>

<p></p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">

  array = [];
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Promise</span>(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">resolve</span> =&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">resolve</span>()).<span class="hljs-title function_">then</span>(<span class="hljs-function">() =&gt;</span> {
    array.<span class="hljs-title function_">push</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'text'</span>)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> array
  })
}

<span class="hljs-title function_">var_fun</span>().<span class="hljs-title function_">then</span>(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">result</span> =&gt;</span> {<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(result)})</code></pre>
<div class="snippet-result"><div class="snippet-ctas"><button type="button" class="s-btn s-btn__primary"><span class="icon-play-white _hover"></span><span> Run code snippet</span></button><input class="copySnippet s-btn s-btn__filled" type="button" value="Copy snippet to answer" style="display: none;"><button type="button" class="s-btn hideResults" style="display: none;">Hide results</button><div class="popout-code"><a class="snippet-expand-link">Expand snippet</a></div></div><div class="snippet-result-code" style="display: none;"><iframe name="sif3" sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-scripts" class="snippet-box-edit snippet-box-result" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></div></div>
</div>
<p></p>

<p>As someeone trying to learn this this is how I see it. The above examples were maybe a bit overly complicated for a beginner. </p>

<p>If you run this code:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> local = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-variable language_">global</span> = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;


<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">test</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> local = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-variable language_">global</span> = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(local)
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">global</span>)
}

<span class="hljs-title function_">test</span>();

<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(local);
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">global</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>The output will read as:  false, false, true, true</p>

<p>Because it sees the variables in the function as seperate from those outside of it, hence the term local variable and this was because we used var in the assignment. If you take away the var in the function so it now reads like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> local = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-variable language_">global</span> = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;


<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">test</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
  local = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">global</span> = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(local)
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">global</span>)
}

<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(local);
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">global</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>The output is false, false, false, false</p>

<p>This is because rather than creating a new variable in the local scope or function it simply uses the global variables and reassigns them to false. </p>

<p>You should use var keyword unless you intend to have the variable attached to window object in browser. <a href="http://www.yourtechchick.com/javascript/difference-between-javascript-variables-with-var-and-without-var/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here's a link that explains scoping and difference between glocal scoping and local scoping with and wihtout var keyword.</a></p>

<p>When variables get defined without the use of var keyword, what it looks like is a simple assignment operation.</p>

<p>When the value is assigned to a variable in javascript, the interpreter first tries to find the variable declaration in the same context/scope as that of assignment. When the interpreter executes <code>dummyVariable = 20</code>, it looks up for the declaration of dummyVariable at beginning of the function. 
(Since all Variable declarations are moved to the beginning of the context by javascript interpreter and this is called hoisting)</p>

As a consequence, the property created via this implicit assignment can then be deleted from the global object, and the former one - the one created via variable declaration - cannot be deleted.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;But this is just theory of course, and \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;in practice there are even more differences between the two\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;, due to various bugs in implementations (such as those from IE).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hope it all makes sense : )\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;[Update 2010/12/16]\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In ES5 (ECMAScript 5; recently standardized, 5th edition of the language) there\u0026apos;s a so-called \u0026quot;strict mode\u0026quot;  an opt-in language mode, which slightly changes the behavior of undeclared assignments.

No matter declared with or without var (like a, b) if they get their value outside the function, they will preserve their value and also any other values that are added inside various functions through the script are preserved.\\n 2. If the variable is declared without var inside a function (like c), it will act like the previous rule, it will preserve its value across all functions from now on.
