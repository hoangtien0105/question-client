I usually use bash, but I don&apos;t know what&apos;s the difference between them.\nWhat&apos;s main difference between Bash and sh?\nWhat do we need to be aware of when programming in Bash and sh?\n    ","answerCount":12,"upVoteCount":500,"suggestedAnswer":[{"text":"What is sh?\nsh (or the Shell Command Language) is a programming language described by the POSIX standard. It has many implementations (ksh88, Dash, ...). Bash can also be considered an implementation of sh (see below).\nBecause sh is a specification, not an implementation, /bin/sh is a symlink (or a hard link) to an actual implementation on most POSIX systems.\nWhat is Bash?\nBash started as an sh-compatible implementation (although it predates the POSIX standard by a few years), but as time passed it has acquired many extensions. Many of these extensions may change the behavior of valid POSIX shell scripts, so by itself Bash is not a valid POSIX shell. Rather, it is a dialect of the POSIX shell language.\nBash supports a --posix switch, which makes it more POSIX-compliant. It also tries to mimic POSIX if invoked as sh.\nsh = bash?\nFor a long time, /bin/sh used to point to /bin/bash on most GNU/Linux systems. As a result, it had almost become safe to ignore the difference between the two. But that started to change recently.\nSome popular examples of systems where /bin/sh does not point to /bin/bash (and on some of which /bin/bash may not even exist) are:\n\nModern Debian and Ubuntu systems, which symlink sh to dash by default;\nBusybox, which is usually run during the Linux system boot time as part of initramfs. It uses the ash shell implementation.\nBSD systems, and in general any non-Linux systems. OpenBSD uses pdksh, a descendant of the KornShell. FreeBSD&apos;s sh is a descendant of the original Unix Bourne shell.  Solaris has its own sh which for a long time was not POSIX-compliant; a free implementation is available from the Heirloom project.\n\nHow can you find out what /bin/sh points to on your system?\nThe complication is that /bin/sh could be a symbolic link or a hard link. If it&apos;s a symbolic link, a portable way to resolve it is:\n% file -h /bin/sh\n/bin/sh: symbolic link to bash\n\nIf it&apos;s a hard link, try\n% find -L /bin -samefile /bin/sh\n/bin/sh\n/bin/bash\n\nIn fact, the -L flag covers both symlinks and hardlinks,\nbut the disadvantage of this method is that it is not portable \nPOSIX does not require find to support the -samefile option, although both GNU find and FreeBSD find support it.\nShebang line\nUltimately, it&apos;s up to you to decide which one to use, by writing the «shebang» line as the very first line of the script.\nE.g.\n#!/bin/sh\n\nwill use sh (and whatever that happens to point to),\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwill use /bin/bash if it&apos;s available (and fail with an error message if it&apos;s not). Of course, you can also specify another implementation, e.g.\n#!/bin/dash\n\nWhich one to use\nFor my own scripts, I prefer sh for the following reasons:\n\nit is standardized\nit is much simpler and easier to learn\nit is portable across POSIX systems  even if they happen not to have bash, they are required to have sh\n\nThere are advantages to using bash as well. Its features make programming more convenient and similar to programming in other modern programming languages. These include things like scoped local variables and arrays. Plain sh is a very minimalistic programming language.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"sh: http://man.cx/sh \nBash: http://man.cx/bash\nTL;DR: Bash is a superset of sh with a more elegant syntax and more functionality.

Here&apos;s a quick rundown of common misunderstandings and pitfalls.\nFirst off, you should understand what to expect.\n\nIf you run your script with sh scriptname, or run it with scriptname and have #!/bin/sh in the shebang line, you should expect POSIX sh behavior.\nIf you run your script with bash scriptname, or run it with scriptname and have #!/bin/bash (or the local equivalent) in the shebang line, you should expect Bash behavior.\n\nHaving a correct shebang and running the script by typing just the script name (possibly with a relative or full path) is generally the preferred solution.  In addition to a correct shebang, this requires the script file to have execute permission (chmod a+x scriptname).\nSo, how do they actually differ?\nBash aims to be backwards-compatible with the Bourne shell and POSIX, but has many additional features. The Bash Reference manual has a section which attempts to enumerate the differences but some common sources of confusion include\n\n[[ is not available in sh (only [ which is more clunky and limited). See also Difference between single and double square brackets in Bash\nsh does not have arrays.\nSome Bash keywords like local, source, function, shopt, let, declare, and select are not portable to sh. (Some sh implementations support e.g. local.)\nBash has many C-style syntax extensions like the three-argument for((i=0;i&lt;=3;i++)) loop, += increment assignment, etc. The $&apos;string\\nwith\\tC\\aescapes&apos; feature is tentatively accepted for POSIX (meaning it works in Bash now, but will not yet be supported by sh on systems which only adhere to the current POSIX specification, and likely will not for some time to come).\nBash supports &lt;&lt;&lt;&apos;here strings&apos;.\nBash has *.{png,jpg} and {0..12} brace expansion.\nBash has extended globbing facilities like ** (globstar) for recursing subdirectories, and extglob for using a different, more versatile wildcard syntax.\n~ refers to $HOME only in Bash (and more generally ~username to the home directory of username).This is in POSIX, but may be missing from some pre-POSIX /bin/sh implementations.\nBash has process substitution with &lt;(cmd) and &gt;(cmd).\nBash has Csh-style convenience redirection aliases like &amp;| for 2&gt;&amp;1 | and &amp;&gt; for &gt; ... 2&gt;&amp;1\nBash supports coprocesses with &lt;&gt; redirection.\nBash features a rich set of expanded non-standard parameter expansions such as ${substring:1:2}, ${variable/pattern/replacement}, case conversion, etc.\nBash has significantly extended facilities for shell arithmetic (though still no floating-point support). There is an obsolescent legacy $[expression] syntax which however should be replaced with POSIX arithmetic $((expression)) syntax. (Some legacy pre-POSIX sh implementations may not support that, though.)\nSeveral built-in commands have options which are not portable, like type -a, printf -v, and the perennial echo -e.\nMagic variables like $RANDOM, $SECONDS, $PIPESTATUS[@] and $FUNCNAME are Bash extensions.\nBash exposes some system facilities as file handles, like /dev/stdin, /dev/fd/&lt;number&gt;, /dev/tcp/&lt;network address&gt;, etc\nSyntactic differences like export variable=value and [ &quot;x&quot; == &quot;y&quot; ] which are not portable (export variable should be separate from variable assignment, and portable string comparison in [ ... ] uses a single equals sign).\nMany, many Bash-only extensions to enable or disable optional behavior and expose internal state of the shell.\nMany, many convenience features for interactive use which however do not affect script behavior.\n\nRemember, this is an abridged listing.  Refer to the reference manual for the full scoop, and http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Bashism for many good workarounds; and/or try http://shellcheck.net/ which warns for many Bash-only features.\nA common error is to have a #!/bin/bash shebang line, but then nevertheless using sh scriptname to actually run the script. This basically disables any Bash-only functionality, so you get syntax errors e.g. for trying to use arrays. (The shebang line is syntactically a comment, so it is simply ignored in this scenario.)\nUnfortunately, Bash will not warn when you try to use these constructs when it is invoked as sh. It doesn&apos;t completely disable all Bash-only functionality, either, so running Bash by invoking it as sh is not a good way to check if your script is properly portable to ash/dash/POSIX sh or variants like Heirloom sh.\nIf you want to check for strict POSIX compliance, try posh\nin its designated POSIX mode\n(which however does not seem to be properly documented).\nAs an aside, the POSIX standardization effort is intended to specify the behavior of various U*x-like platform behaviors, including the shell (sh).\nHowever, this is an evolving document, and so, some implementations adhere to an earlier version of the POSIX specification; furthermore, there are some legacy implementations which didn&apos;t even try to adhere to POSIX.\nThe original Bourne shell had some quirks  which were later straightened out by the POSIX spec, which in large parts is based on ksh88. (Many of the Bash extensions are also innovations from ksh.)\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Shell is an interface between a user and OS to access to an operating system&apos;s services.

The term macro processor means functionality where text and\n  symbols are expanded to create larger expressions.\n  \n  A Unix shell is both a command interpreter and a programming language.\n  As a command interpreter, the shell provides the user interface to the\n  rich set of GNU utilities. The programming language features allow\n  these utilities to be combined. Files containing commands can be\n  created, and become commands themselves. These new commands have the\n  same status as system commands in directories such as /bin, allowing\n  users or groups to establish custom environments to automate their\n  common tasks.\n  \n  Shells may be used interactively or non-interactively. In interactive\n  mode, they accept input typed from the keyboard. When executing\n  non-interactively, shells execute commands read from a file.\n  \n  A shell allows execution of GNU commands, both synchronously and\n  asynchronously. The shell waits for synchronous commands to complete\n  before accepting more input; asynchronous commands continue to execute\n  in parallel with the shell while it reads and executes additional\n  commands. The redirection constructs permit fine-grained control of\n  the input and output of those commands. Moreover, the shell allows\n  control over the contents of commands environments.\n  \n  Shells also provide a small set of built-in commands (builtins)\n  implementing functionality impossible or inconvenient to obtain via\n  separate utilities. For example, cd, break, continue, and exec cannot\n  be implemented outside of the shell because they directly manipulate\n  the shell itself. The history, getopts, kill, or pwd builtins, among\n  others, could be implemented in separate utilities, but they are more\n  convenient to use as builtin commands. All of the shell builtins are\n  described in subsequent sections.\n  \n  While executing commands is essential, most of the power (and\n  complexity) of shells is due to their embedded programming languages.\n  Like any high-level language, the shell provides variables, flow\n  control constructs, quoting, and functions.\n  \n  Shells offer features geared specifically for interactive use rather\n  than to augment the programming language. These interactive features\n  include job control, command line editing, command history and\n  aliases. Each of these features is described in this manual.\n\n\nBASH gnu.org:\n\n\n  Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU\n  operating system.

It is intended to be a\n  conformant implementation of the IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools portion of\n  the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1). It offers\n  functional improvements over sh for both interactive and programming\n  use.\n  \n  While the GNU operating system provides other shells, including a\n  version of csh, Bash is the default shell.

<h1>What is sh?</h1>
<p><code>sh</code> (or the Shell Command Language) is a programming language described by the <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html" rel="noreferrer">POSIX standard</a>. It has many implementations (<code>ksh88</code>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell#dash:_Ubuntu,_Debian_and_POSIX_compliance_of_Linux_distributions" rel="noreferrer">Dash</a>, ...). Bash can also be considered an implementation of <code>sh</code> (see below).</p>
<p>Because <code>sh</code> is a specification, not an implementation, <code>/bin/sh</code> is a symlink (or a hard link) to an actual implementation on most POSIX systems.</p>
<h1>What is Bash?</h1>
<p>Bash started as an <code>sh</code>-compatible implementation (although it predates the POSIX standard by a few years), but as time passed it has acquired many extensions. Many of these extensions may change the behavior of valid POSIX shell scripts, so by itself Bash is not a valid POSIX shell. Rather, it is a dialect of the POSIX shell language.</p>
<p>Bash supports a <code>--posix</code> switch, which makes it more POSIX-compliant. It also tries to mimic POSIX if invoked as <code>sh</code>.</p>
<h1>sh = bash?</h1>
<p>For a long time, <code>/bin/sh</code> used to point to <code>/bin/bash</code> on most GNU/Linux systems. As a result, it had almost become safe to ignore the difference between the two. But that started to change recently.</p>
<p>Some popular examples of systems where <code>/bin/sh</code> does not point to <code>/bin/bash</code> (and on some of which <code>/bin/bash</code> may not even exist) are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Modern Debian and Ubuntu systems, which symlink <code>sh</code> to <code>dash</code> by default;</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusyBox" rel="noreferrer">Busybox</a>, which is usually run during the Linux system boot time as part of <code>initramfs</code>. It uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell" rel="noreferrer">ash</a> shell implementation.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution" rel="noreferrer">BSD</a> systems, and in general any non-Linux systems. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBSD" rel="noreferrer">OpenBSD</a> uses <code>pdksh</code>, a descendant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell" rel="noreferrer">KornShell</a>. FreeBSD's <code>sh</code> is a descendant of the original Unix Bourne shell.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_%28operating_system%29" rel="noreferrer">Solaris</a> has its own <code>sh</code> which for a long time was not POSIX-compliant; a free implementation is available from the <a href="http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/sh.html" rel="noreferrer">Heirloom project</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>How can you find out what <code>/bin/sh</code> points to on your system?</p>
<p>The complication is that <code>/bin/sh</code> could be a symbolic link or a hard link. If it's a symbolic link, a <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/file.html" rel="noreferrer">portable</a> way to resolve it is:</p>
<pre class="lang-bash s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash">% file -h /bin/sh
/bin/sh: symbolic <span class="hljs-built_in">link</span> to bash
</code></pre>
<p>If it's a hard link, try</p>
<pre class="lang-bash s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash">% find -L /bin -samefile /bin/sh
/bin/sh
/bin/bash
</code></pre>
<p>In fact, the <code>-L</code> flag covers both symlinks and hardlinks,
but the disadvantage of this method is that it is not portable 
POSIX <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/find.html" rel="noreferrer">does not require</a> <code>find</code> to support the <code>-samefile</code> option, although both <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/findutils/manual/html_mono/find.html#Hard-Links" rel="noreferrer">GNU find</a> and <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?find(1)" rel="noreferrer">FreeBSD find</a> support it.</p>
<h1>Shebang line</h1>
<p>Ultimately, it's up to you to decide which one to use, by writing the «shebang» line as the very first line of the script.</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<pre class="lang-bash s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-meta">#!/bin/sh</span>
</code></pre>
<p>will use <code>sh</code> (and whatever that happens to point to),</p>
<pre class="lang-bash s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-meta">#!/bin/bash</span>
</code></pre>
<p>will use <code>/bin/bash</code> if it's available (and fail with an error message if it's not). Of course, you can also specify another implementation, e.g.</p>
<pre class="lang-bash s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-meta">#!/bin/dash</span>
</code></pre>
<h1>Which one to use</h1>
<p>For my own scripts, I prefer <code>sh</code> for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is standardized</li>
<li>it is much simpler and easier to learn</li>
<li>it is portable across POSIX systems  even if they happen not to have <code>bash</code>, they are required to have <code>sh</code></li>
</ul>
<p>There are advantages to using <code>bash</code> as well. Its features make programming more convenient and similar to programming in other modern programming languages. These include things like scoped local variables and arrays. Plain <code>sh</code> is a very minimalistic programming language.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Bash is a superset of <code>sh</code> with a more elegant syntax and more functionality. It is safe to use a Bash <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)" rel="noreferrer">shebang</a> line in almost all cases as it's quite ubiquitous on modern platforms.</p>

<p>This question has frequently been nominated as a canonical for people who try to use <code>sh</code> and are surprised that it's not behaving the same as <code>bash</code>.  Here's a quick rundown of common misunderstandings and pitfalls.</p>
<p>First off, you should understand what to expect.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you run your script with <code>sh scriptname</code>, or run it with <code>scriptname</code> and have <code>#!/bin/sh</code> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">shebang</a> line, you should expect POSIX <code>sh</code> behavior.</li>
<li>If you run your script with <code>bash scriptname</code>, or run it with <code>scriptname</code> and have <code>#!/bin/bash</code> (or the local equivalent) in the shebang line, you should expect Bash behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having a correct shebang and running the script by typing just the script name (possibly with a <a href="/questions/31435921/difference-between-and/55342466#55342466">relative or full path</a>) is generally the preferred solution.  In addition to a correct shebang, this requires the script file to have execute permission (<code>chmod a+x scriptname</code>).</p>
<p>So, how do they actually differ?</p>
<p>Bash aims to be backwards-compatible with the Bourne shell and POSIX, but has many additional features. The Bash Reference manual has a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Major-Differences-From-The-Bourne-Shell.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">section which attempts to enumerate the differences</a> but some common sources of confusion include</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[[</code> is not available in <code>sh</code> (only <code>[</code> which is more clunky and limited). See also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13542832/difference-between-single-and-double-square-brackets-in-bash">Difference between single and double square brackets in Bash</a></li>
<li><code>sh</code> does not have arrays.</li>
<li>Some Bash keywords like <code>local</code>, <code>source</code>, <code>function</code>, <code>shopt</code>, <code>let</code>, <code>declare</code>, and <code>select</code> are not portable to <code>sh</code>. (Some <code>sh</code> implementations support e.g. <code>local</code>.)</li>
<li>Bash has many C-style syntax extensions like the three-argument <code>for((i=0;i&lt;=3;i++))</code> loop, <code>+=</code> increment assignment, etc. The <code>$'string\nwith\tC\aescapes'</code> feature is tentatively <a href="http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=249" rel="nofollow noreferrer">accepted for POSIX</a> (meaning it works in Bash now, but will not yet be supported by <code>sh</code> on systems which only adhere to the current POSIX specification, and likely will not for some time to come).</li>
<li>Bash supports <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;'here strings'</code>.</li>
<li>Bash has <code>*.{png,jpg}</code> and <code>{0..12}</code> brace expansion.</li>
<li>Bash has extended globbing facilities like <code>**</code> (<code>globstar</code>) for recursing subdirectories, and <code>extglob</code> for using a different, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Pattern-Matching" rel="nofollow noreferrer">more versatile wildcard syntax.</a></li>
<li><del><code>~</code> refers to <code>$HOME</code> only in Bash (and more generally <code>~username</code> to the home directory of <code>username</code>).</del>This is in POSIX, but may be missing from some pre-POSIX <code>/bin/sh</code> implementations.</li>
<li>Bash has process substitution with <code>&lt;(cmd)</code> and <code>&gt;(cmd)</code>.</li>
<li>Bash has Csh-style convenience redirection aliases like <code>&amp;|</code> for <code>2&gt;&amp;1 |</code> and <code>&amp;&gt;</code> for <code>&gt; ... 2&gt;&amp;1</code></li>
<li>Bash supports coprocesses with <code>&lt;&gt;</code> redirection.</li>
<li>Bash features a rich set of expanded non-standard parameter expansions such as <code>${substring:1:2}</code>, <code>${variable/pattern/replacement}</code>, case conversion, etc.</li>
<li>Bash has significantly extended facilities for shell arithmetic (though still no floating-point support). There is an obsolescent legacy <code>$[expression]</code> syntax which however should be replaced with POSIX arithmetic <code>$((expression))</code> syntax. (Some legacy pre-POSIX <code>sh</code> implementations may not support that, though.)</li>
<li>Several built-in commands have options which are not portable, like <code>type -a</code>, <code>printf -v</code>, and the perennial <code>echo -e</code>.</li>
<li>Magic variables like <code>$RANDOM</code>, <code>$SECONDS</code>, <code>$PIPESTATUS[@]</code> and <code>$FUNCNAME</code> are Bash extensions.</li>
<li>Bash exposes some system facilities as file handles, like <code>/dev/stdin</code>, <code>/dev/fd/&lt;number&gt;</code>, <code>/dev/tcp/&lt;network address&gt;</code>, etc</li>
<li>Syntactic differences like <del><code>export variable=value</code> and</del> <code>[ "x" == "y" ]</code> which are not portable (<del><code>export variable</code> should be separate from variable assignment, and</del> portable string comparison in <code>[ ... ]</code> uses a single equals sign).</li>
<li>Many, many Bash-only extensions to enable or disable optional behavior and expose internal state of the shell.</li>
<li>Many, many convenience features for interactive use which however do not affect script behavior.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, this is an abridged listing.  Refer to the reference manual for the full scoop, and <a href="http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Bashism" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://mywiki.wooledge.org/Bashism</a> for many good workarounds; and/or try <a href="http://shellcheck.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://shellcheck.net/</a> which warns for many Bash-only features.</p>
<p>A common error is to have a <code>#!/bin/bash</code> shebang line, but then nevertheless using <code>sh scriptname</code> to actually run the script. This basically disables any Bash-only functionality, so you get syntax errors e.g. for trying to use arrays. (The shebang line is syntactically a comment, so it is simply ignored in this scenario.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Bash will not warn when you try to use these constructs when it is invoked as <code>sh</code>. It doesn't completely disable <em>all</em> Bash-only functionality, either, so running Bash by invoking it as <code>sh</code> is not a good way to check if your script is properly portable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ash</code></a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell#dash:_Ubuntu,_Debian_and_POSIX_compliance_of_Linux_distributions" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>dash</code></a>/POSIX <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sh.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>sh</code></a> or variants like <a href="http://heirloom.sourceforge.net/sh.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Heirloom <code>sh</code></a>.
If you want to check for strict POSIX compliance, try <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/unstable/posh/posh.1.en.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>posh</code></a>

(which however does not seem to be properly documented).</p>
<p>As an aside, the <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">POSIX</a> standardization effort is intended to specify the behavior of various U*x-like platform behaviors, including the <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799//idx/shell.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">shell</a> (<code>sh</code>).
However, this is an evolving document, and so, some implementations adhere to an earlier version of the POSIX specification; furthermore, there are some legacy implementations which didn't even try to adhere to POSIX.
The original Bourne shell had some quirks  which were later straightened out by the POSIX spec, which in large parts is based on <code>ksh88</code>. (Many of the Bash extensions are also innovations from <code>ksh</code>.)</p>

<p><strong>Shell</strong> is an interface between a user and OS to access to an operating system's services. It can be either GUI or CLI (Command Line interface).</p>

<p><strong>sh</strong> (Bourne <strong>sh</strong>ell) is a shell command-line interpreter, for Unix/Unix-like operating systems. It provides some built-in commands. In scripting language we denote interpreter as <code>#!/bin/sh</code>. It was one most widely supported by other shells like bash (free/open), kash (not free).</p>

<p><strong>Bash</strong> (<strong>B</strong>ourne <strong>a</strong>gain <strong>s</strong>hell) is a shell replacement for the Bourne shell. Bash is superset of sh. Bash supports sh. POSIX is a set of standards defining how POSIX-compliant systems should work.  Bash is not actually a POSIX compliant shell. In a scripting language we denote the interpreter as <code>#!/bin/bash</code>.</p>

<li>sh is a class which implements the Shell interface.  </li>

<p><strong>Shell features</strong></p>
<p>This table below lists most features that I think would make you choose one shell over another. It is not intended to be a definitive list and does not include every single possible feature for every single possible shell. A feature is only considered to be in a shell if in the version that comes with the operating system, or if it is available as compiled directly from the standard distribution. In particular the C shell specified below is that available on SUNOS 4.*, a considerable number of vendors now ship either tcsh or their own enhanced C shell instead (they don't always make it obvious that they are shipping tcsh.</p>

<p><strong>SHELL</strong>
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/What-is-a-shell_003f.html#What-is-a-shell_003f">gnu.org:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At its base, a <strong>shell is simply a macro processor</strong> that executes
  commands. The term <strong>macro processor means functionality where text and
  symbols are expanded to create larger expressions.</strong></p>
  
  <p>A Unix <strong>shell is both a command interpreter and a programming language.</strong>
  As a command interpreter, the shell provides the user interface to the
  rich set of GNU utilities. The programming language features allow
  these utilities to be combined. Files containing commands can be
  created, and become commands themselves. These new commands have the
  same status as system commands in directories such as /bin, allowing
  users or groups to establish custom environments to automate their
  common tasks.</p>
  
  <p>Shells may be used interactively or non-interactively. In interactive
  mode, they accept input typed from the keyboard. When executing
  non-interactively, shells execute commands read from a file.</p>
  
  <p>A shell allows execution of GNU commands, both synchronously and
  asynchronously. The shell waits for synchronous commands to complete
  before accepting more input; asynchronous commands continue to execute
  in parallel with the shell while it reads and executes additional
  commands. The redirection constructs permit fine-grained control of
  the input and output of those commands. Moreover, the shell allows
  control over the contents of commands environments.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Shells also provide a small set of built-in commands (builtins)
  implementing functionality impossible or inconvenient to obtain via
  separate utilities</strong>. <strong>For example, cd, break, continue, and exec cannot
  be implemented outside of the shell</strong> because they directly manipulate
  the shell itself. The history, getopts, kill, or pwd builtins, among
  others, could be implemented in separate utilities, but they are more
  convenient to use as builtin commands. All of the shell builtins are
  described in subsequent sections.</p>
  
  <p>While executing commands is essential, <strong>most of the power (and
  complexity) of shells is due to their embedded programming languages.</strong>
  Like any high-level language, the shell provides variables, flow
  control constructs, quoting, and functions.</p>
  
  <p>Shells offer features geared specifically for interactive use rather
  than to augment the programming language. These interactive features
  include job control, command line editing, command history and
  aliases. Each of these features is described in this manual.</p>

<p><strong>BASH</strong> <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/What-is-Bash_003f.html#What-is-Bash_003f">gnu.org:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bash is the shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU
  operating system. The name is an acronym for the Bourne-Again SHell,
  a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the
  current Unix shell sh, which appeared in the Seventh Edition Bell Labs
  Research version of Unix.</p>
  
  <p>Bash is largely compatible with sh and incorporates useful features
  from the Korn shell ksh and the C shell csh. It is intended to be a
  conformant implementation of the IEEE POSIX Shell and Tools portion of
  the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1). It offers
  functional improvements over sh for both interactive and programming
  use.</p>
  
  <p>While the GNU operating system provides other shells, including a
  version of csh, <strong>Bash is the default shell</strong>. Like other GNU software,
  Bash is quite portable. It currently runs on nearly every version of
  Unix and a few other operating systems - independently-supported ports
  exist for MS-DOS, OS/2, and Windows platforms.</p>

<p>Other answers generally pointed out the difference between Bash and a POSIX shell standard. However, when writing portable shell scripts and being used to Bash syntax, a list of typical bashisms and corresponding pure POSIX solutions is very handy. Such list has been compiled when Ubuntu switched from Bash to Dash as default system shell and can be found here:
<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh</a></p>

<p>Moreover, there is a great tool called <a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/saucy/man1/checkbashisms.1.html">checkbashisms</a> that checks for bashisms in your script and comes handy when you want to make sure that your script is portable.</p>

<p>bash and sh are two different shells. Basically bash is sh, with more features and better syntax. Most commands work the same, but they are different.Bash (bash) is one of many available (yet the most commonly used) Unix shells. Bash stands for "Bourne Again SHell",and is a replacement/improvement of the original Bourne shell (sh).</p>

<p>Shell scripting is scripting in any shell, whereas Bash scripting is scripting specifically for Bash. In practice, however, "shell script" and "bash script" are often used interchangeably, unless the shell in question is not Bash.</p>

<p>Having said that, you should realize /bin/sh on most systems will be a symbolic link and will not invoke sh. In Ubuntu /bin/sh used to link to bash, typical behavior on Linux distributions, but now has changed to linking to another shell called dash. I would use bash, as that is pretty much the standard (or at least most common, from my experience). In fact, problems arise when a bash script will use #!/bin/sh because the script-maker assumes the link is to bash when it doesn't have to be.</p>

<p><strong>They're nearly identical but <code>bash</code> has more features</strong>  <code>sh</code> is (more or less) an older subset of <code>bash</code>.</p>
<p><code>sh</code> often means the original <code>Bourne shell</code>, which predates <code>bash</code> (<code>Bourne *again* shell</code>), and was created in 1977.  But, in practice, it may be better to think of it as a highly-cross-compatible shell compliant with the POSIX standard from 1992.</p>
<p>Scripts that start with <code>#!/bin/sh</code> or use the <code>sh</code> shell usually do so for backwards compatibility.  Any unix/linux OS will have an <code>sh</code> shell.  On Ubuntu <code>sh</code> often invokes <code>dash</code> and on MacOS it's a special POSIX version of <code>bash</code>.  These shells may be preferred for standard-compliant behavior, speed or backwards compatibility.</p>
<p><code>bash</code> is newer than the original <code>sh</code>, adds more features, and seeks to be backwards compatible with <code>sh</code>.  <code>sh</code> programs will usually run just fine in <code>bash</code>.  <code>bash</code> is available on nearly all linux/unix machines and usually used by default  with the notable exception of MacOS defaulting to <code>zsh</code> as of Catalina (10.15).

<p>The Linux operating system offers different types of shell. Though shells have many commands in common, each type has unique features.
Lets study different kind of mostly used shells.</p>
<p><strong>Sh shell:</strong></p>
<p>Sh shell is also known as Bourne shell. Sh shell is the first shell developed for Unix computers by Stephen Bourne at AT&amp;T's Bell Labs in 1977. It includes many scripting tools.</p>
<p><strong>Bash shell:</strong></p>
<p>Bash shell stands for Bourne Again Shell. Bash shell is the default shell in most Linux distributions and substitute for the Sh shell (the Sh shell will also run in the Bash shell). The Bash shell can execute the vast majority of Sh shell scripts without modification and provide commands line editing feature also.</p>

The programming language features allow\n  these utilities to be combined. Files containing commands can be\n  created, and become commands themselves. These new commands have the\n  same status as system commands in directories such as /bin, allowing\n  users or groups to establish custom environments to automate their\n  common tasks.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n  \n  \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Shells may be used interactively or non-interactively. In interactive\n  mode, they accept input typed from the keyboard. When executing\n  non-interactively, shells execute commands read from a file.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n  \n  \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A shell allows execution of GNU commands, both synchronously and\n  asynchronously. The shell waits for synchronous commands to complete\n  before accepting more input; asynchronous commands continue to execute\n  in parallel with the shell while it reads and executes additional\n  commands. The redirection constructs permit fine-grained control of\n  the input and output of those commands. Moreover, the shell allows\n  control over the contents of commands environments.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n  \n  \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Shells also provide a small set of built-in commands (builtins)\n  implementing functionality impossible or inconvenient to obtain via\n  separate utilities\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;. \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;For example, cd, break, continue, and exec cannot\n  be implemented outside of the shell\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; because they directly manipulate\n  the shell itself.

However, when writing portable shell scripts and being used to Bash syntax, a list of typical bashisms and corresponding pure POSIX solutions is very handy. Such list has been compiled when Ubuntu switched from Bash to Dash as default system shell and can be found here:\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh\u0026quot;\u0026gt;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Moreover, there is a great tool called \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/saucy/man1/checkbashisms.1.html\u0026quot;\u0026gt;checkbashisms\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; that checks for bashisms in your script and comes handy when you want to make sure that your script is portable.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;bash and sh are two different shells. Basically bash is sh, with more features and better syntax. Most commands work the same, but they are different.Bash (bash) is one of many available (yet the most commonly used) Unix shells. Bash stands for \u0026quot;Bourne Again SHell\u0026quot;,and is a replacement/improvement of the original Bourne shell (sh).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Shell scripting is scripting in any shell, whereas Bash scripting is scripting specifically for Bash.

In Ubuntu /bin/sh used to link to bash, typical behavior on Linux distributions, but now has changed to linking to another shell called dash. I would use bash, as that is pretty much the standard (or at least most common, from my experience). In fact, problems arise when a bash script will use #!/bin/sh because the script-maker assumes the link is to bash when it doesn\u0026apos;t have to be.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;They\u0026apos;re nearly identical but \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;bash\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; has more features\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;sh\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is (more or less) an older subset of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;bash\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;sh\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; often means the original \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Bourne shell\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, which predates \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;bash\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; (\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Bourne *again* shell\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;), and was created in 1977.
