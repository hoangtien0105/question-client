(Will add more links as and when I come across them)\n\nWhen you want to present a worksheet to a user so that the user can see it.\nScenarios like Working macro returns error when run from form control where you are forced to use .Activate\nWhen usual methods of Text To Columns / .Formula = .Formula doesn&apos;t work then you may have to resort to .Select\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"One small point of emphasis I&apos;ll add to all the excellent answers given previously:\nProbably the biggest thing you can do to avoid using Select is to as much as possible, use named ranges (combined with meaningful variable names) in your VBA code. This point was mentioned above, but it was glossed over a bit; however, it deserves special attention.\nHere are a couple of additional reasons to make liberal use of named ranges, though I am sure I could think of more.\nNamed ranges make your code easier to read and understand.\nExample:\nDim Months As Range\nDim MonthlySales As Range\n\nSet Months = Range(&quot;Months&quot;)\n&apos; E.g, &quot;Months&quot; might be a named range referring to A1:A12\n\nSet MonthlySales = Range(&quot;MonthlySales&quot;)\n&apos; E.g, &quot;Monthly Sales&quot; might be a named range referring to B1:B12\n\nDim Month As Range\nFor Each Month in Months\n    Debug.Print MonthlySales(Month.Row)\nNext Month\n\nIt is pretty obvious what the named ranges Months and MonthlySales contain, and what the procedure is doing.\nWhy is this important? Partially because it is easier for other people to understand it, but even if you are the only person who will ever see or use your code, you should still use named ranges and good variable names because you will forget what you meant to do with it a year later, and you will waste 30 minutes just figuring out what your code is doing.\nNamed ranges ensure that your macros do not break when (not if!) the configuration of the spreadsheet changes.\nConsider, if the above example had been written like this:\nDim rng1 As Range\nDim rng2 As Range\n\nSet rng1 = Range(&quot;A1:A12&quot;)\nSet rng2 = Range(&quot;B1:B12&quot;)\n\nDim rng3 As Range\nFor Each rng3 in rng1\n    Debug.Print rng2(rng3.Row)\nNext rng3\n\nThis code will work just fine at first - that is until you or a future user decides &quot;gee wiz, I think I&apos;m going to add a new column with the year in Column A!&quot;, or put an expenses column between the months and sales columns, or add a header to each column. Now, your code is broken. And because you used terrible variable names, it will take you a lot more time to figure out how to fix it than it should take.\nIf you had used named ranges to begin with, the Months and Sales columns could be moved around all you like, and your code would continue working just fine.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I&apos;m going to give the short answer since everyone else gave the long one.\n\nYou&apos;ll get .select and .activate whenever you record macros and reuse them.  When you .select a cell or sheet it just makes it active.  From that point on whenever you use unqualified references like Range.Value they just use the active cell and sheet.  This can also be problematic if you don&apos;t watch where your code is placed or a user clicks on the workbook.\n\nSo, you can eliminate these issues by directly referencing your cells.  Which goes:\n\n&apos;create and set a range\nDim Rng As Excel.Range\nSet Rng = Workbooks(&quot;Book1&quot;).Worksheets(&quot;Sheet1&quot;).Range(&quot;A1&quot;)\n&apos;OR\nSet Rng = Workbooks(1).Worksheets(1).Cells(1, 1)\n\n\nOr you could\n\n&apos;Just deal with the cell directly rather than creating a range\n&apos;I want to put the string &quot;Hello&quot; in Range A1 of sheet 1\nWorkbooks(&quot;Book1&quot;).Worksheets(&quot;Sheet1&quot;).Range(&quot;A1&quot;).value = &quot;Hello&quot;\n&apos;OR\nWorkbooks(1).Worksheets(1).Cells(1, 1).value = &quot;Hello&quot;\n\n\nThere are various combinations of these methods, but that would be the general idea expressed as shortly as possible for impatient people like me.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"\n  &quot;... and am finding that my code would be more re-usable if I were able to use variables instead of Select functions.&quot;\n\n\nWhile I cannot think of any more than an isolated handful of situations where .Select would be a better choice than direct cell referencing, I would rise to the defense of Selection and point out that it should not be thrown out for the same reasons that .Select should be avoided.\n\nThere are times when having short, time-saving macro sub routines assigned to hot-key combinations available with the tap of a couple of keys saves a lot of time. Being able to select a group of cells to enact the operational code on works wonders when dealing with pocketed data that does not conform to a worksheet-wide data format. Much in the same way that you might select a group of cells and apply a format change, selecting a group of cells to run special macro code against can be a major time saver.\n\nExamples of Selection-based sub framework:\n\nPublic Sub Run_on_Selected()\n    Dim rng As Range, rSEL As Range\n    Set rSEL = Selection    &apos;store the current selection in case it changes\n    For Each rng In rSEL\n        Debug.Print rng.Address(0, 0)\n        &apos;cell-by-cell operational code here\n    Next rng\n    Set rSEL = Nothing\nEnd Sub\n\nPublic Sub Run_on_Selected_Visible()\n    &apos;this is better for selected ranges on filtered data or containing hidden rows/columns\n    Dim rng As Range, rSEL As Range\n    Set rSEL = Selection    &apos;store the current selection in case it changes\n    For Each rng In rSEL.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeVisible)\n        Debug.Print rng.Address(0, 0)\n        &apos;cell-by-cell operational code here\n    Next rng\n    Set rSEL = Nothing\nEnd Sub\n\nPublic Sub Run_on_Discontiguous_Area()\n    &apos;this is better for selected ranges of discontiguous areas\n    Dim ara As Range, rng As Range, rSEL As Range\n    Set rSEL = Selection    &apos;store the current selection in case it changes\n    For Each ara In rSEL.Areas\n        Debug.Print ara.Address(0, 0)\n        &apos;cell group operational code here\n        For Each rng In ara.Areas\n            Debug.Print rng.Address(0, 0)\n            &apos;cell-by-cell operational code here\n        Next rng\n    Next ara\n    Set rSEL = Nothing\nEnd Sub\n\n\nThe actual code to process could be anything from a single line to multiple modules. I have used this method to initiate long running routines on a ragged selection of cells containing the filenames of external workbooks.\n\nIn short, don&apos;t discard Selection due to its close association with .Select and ActiveCell. As a worksheet property it has many other purposes.\n\n(Yes, I know this question was about .Select, not Selection but I wanted to remove any misconceptions that novice VBA coders might infer.)\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Avoiding Select and Activate is the move that makes you a bit better VBA developer. In general, Select and Activate are used when a macro is recorded, thus the Parent worksheet or range is always considered the active one.\n\nThis is how you may avoid Select and Activate in the following cases:\n\n\n\nAdding a new Worksheet and copying a cell on it:\n\nFrom (code generated with macro recorder):\n\nSub Makro2()\n    Range(&quot;B2&quot;).Select\n    Sheets.Add After:=ActiveSheet\n    Sheets(&quot;Tabelle1&quot;).Select\n    Sheets(&quot;Tabelle1&quot;).Name = &quot;NewName&quot;\n    ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = &quot;12&quot;\n    Range(&quot;B2&quot;).Select\n    Selection.Copy\n    Range(&quot;B3&quot;).Select\n    ActiveSheet.Paste\n    Application.CutCopyMode = False\nEnd Sub\n\n\nTo:\n\nSub TestMe()\n    Dim ws As Worksheet\n    Set ws = Worksheets.Add\n    With ws\n        .Name = &quot;NewName&quot;\n        .Range(&quot;B2&quot;) = 12\n        .Range(&quot;B2&quot;).Copy Destination:=.Range(&quot;B3&quot;)\n    End With\nEnd Sub\n\n\nWhen you want to copy range between worksheets:\n\nFrom:\n\nSheets(&quot;Source&quot;).Select\nColumns(&quot;A:D&quot;).Select\nSelection.Copy\nSheets(&quot;Target&quot;).Select\nColumns(&quot;A:D&quot;).Select\nActiveSheet.Paste\n\n\nTo:\n\nWorksheets(&quot;Source&quot;).Columns(&quot;A:D&quot;).Copy Destination:=Worksheets(&quot;Target&quot;).Range(&quot;a1&quot;)\n\n\n\n\nUsing fancy named ranges\n\nYou may access them with [], which is really beautiful, compared to the other way. Check yourself:\n\nDim Months As Range\nDim MonthlySales As Range\n\nSet Months = Range(&quot;Months&quot;)    \nSet MonthlySales = Range(&quot;MonthlySales&quot;)\n\nSet Months =[Months]\nSet MonthlySales = [MonthlySales]\n\n\nThe example from above would look like this:\n\nWorksheets(&quot;Source&quot;).Columns(&quot;A:D&quot;).Copy Destination:=Worksheets(&quot;Target&quot;).[A1]\n\n\n\n\nNot copying values, but taking them\n\nUsually, if you are willing to select, most probably you are copying something. If you are only interested in the values, this is a good option to avoid select:\n\nRange(&quot;B1:B6&quot;).Value = Range(&quot;A1:A6&quot;).Value\n\n\n\nTry always to reference the Worksheet as well\n\nThis is probably the most common mistake in vba. Whenever you copy ranges, sometimes the worksheet is not referenced and thus VBA considers the wrong sheet the ActiveWorksheet.\n\n&apos;This will work only if the 2. Worksheet is selected!\nPublic Sub TestMe()\n    Dim rng As Range\n    Set rng = Worksheets(2).Range(Cells(1, 1), Cells(2, 2)).Copy\nEnd Sub\n\n&apos;This works always!\nPublic Sub TestMe2()\n    Dim rng As Range\n    With Worksheets(2)\n        .Range(.Cells(1, 1), .Cells(2, 2)).Copy\n    End With\nEnd Sub\n\n\n\n\nCan I really never use .Select or .Activate for anything?\n\n\nA good example of when you could be justified in using .Activate and .Select is when you want make sure that a specific Worksheet is selected for visual reasons. E.g., that your Excel would always open with the cover worksheet selected first, disregarding which which was the ActiveSheet when the file was closed.\n\n\nThus, something like the code below is absolutely OK:\n\nPrivate Sub Workbook_Open()\n    Worksheets(&quot;Cover&quot;).Activate\nEnd Sub\n\n\n\nAnother good example is when you need to export all sheets into one PDF file, as mentioned in this case - How to avoid select/active statements in VBA in this example?\nWhen a command only works with ActiveWindow like ActiveWindow.Zoom or ActiveWindow.FreezePanes\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution6","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Please note that in the following I&apos;m comparing the Select approach (the one that the OP wants to avoid), with the Range approach (and this is the answer to the question).

A very helpful shortcut to set your Workbook variable with.\nAfter you&apos;ve done that at the top of your Sub, using them could not be simpler, just use them wherever you would use &quot;Selection&quot;:\nSo to change the value of cell &quot;A1&quot; in &quot;Output&quot; to &quot;Hello&quot;, instead of:\nSheets(&quot;Output&quot;).Activate\nActiveSheet.Range(&quot;A1&quot;).Select\nSelection.Value = &quot;Hello&quot;\n\nWe can now do this:\nws.Range(&quot;A1&quot;).Value = &quot;Hello&quot;\n\nWhich is not only much more reliable and less likely to crash if the user is working with multiple spreadsheets; it&apos;s also much shorter, quicker and easier to write.\nAs an added bonus, if you always name your variables &quot;wb&quot; and &quot;ws&quot;, you can copy and paste code from one book to another and it will usually work with minimal changes needed, if any.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution14","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Working with the .Parent feature, this example shows how setting only one myRng reference enables dynamic access to the entire environment without  any .Select, .Activate, .Activecell, .ActiveWorkbook, .ActiveSheet and so on.

<p>I've heard much about the understandable abhorrence of using <code>.Select</code> in Excel VBA, but I am unsure of how to avoid using it. I am finding that my code would be more re-usable if I were able to use variables instead of <code>Select</code> functions. However, I am not sure how to refer to things (like the <code>ActiveCell</code>, etc.) if not using <code>Select</code>.</p>
<p>I have found <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa139976%28v=office.10%29.aspx" rel="noreferrer">this article on ranges</a> and <a href="http://www.businessprogrammer.com/201105/power-excel-vba-secret-avoid-using-select/" rel="noreferrer">this example on the benefits of not using select</a>, but I can't find anything on <em>how</em>.</p>

<h3>Some examples of how to avoid select</h3>
<p>Use <code>Dim</code>'d variables</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">Dim</span> rng <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> Range
</code></pre>
<p><code>Set</code> the variable to the required range. There are many ways to refer to a single-cell range:</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> rng = Range(<span class="hljs-string">"A1"</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> rng = Cells(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> rng = Range(<span class="hljs-string">"NamedRange"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Or a multi-cell range:</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> rng = Range(<span class="hljs-string">"A1:B10"</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> rng = Range(<span class="hljs-string">"A1"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"B10"</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> rng = Range(Cells(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>), Cells(<span class="hljs-number">10</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>))
<span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> rng = Range(<span class="hljs-string">"AnotherNamedRange"</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> rng = Range(<span class="hljs-string">"A1"</span>).Resize(<span class="hljs-number">10</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>You <em>can</em> use the shortcut to the <code>Evaluate</code> method, but this is less efficient and should generally be avoided in production code.</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> rng = [A1]
<span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> rng = [A1:B10]
</code></pre>
<p>All the above examples refer to cells on the <em>active sheet</em>. Unless you specifically want to work only with the active sheet, it is better to Dim a <code>Worksheet</code> variable too:</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">Dim</span> ws <span class="hljs-keyword">As</span> Worksheet
<span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> ws = Worksheets(<span class="hljs-string">"Sheet1"</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> rng = ws.Cells(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">With</span> ws
    <span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> rng = .Range(.Cells(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>), .Cells(<span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">10</span>))
<span class="hljs-keyword">End</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">With</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If you <em>do</em> want to work with the <code>ActiveSheet</code>, for clarity it's best to be explicit. But take care, as some <code>Worksheet</code> methods change the active sheet.</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> rng = ActiveSheet.Range(<span class="hljs-string">"A1"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Again, this refers to the <em>active workbook</em>.  Unless you specifically want to work only with the <code>ActiveWorkbook</code> or <code>ThisWorkbook</code>, it is better to Dim a <code>Workbook</code> variable too.</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">Dim</span> wb <span class="hljs-keyword">As</span> Workbook
<span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> wb = Application.Workbooks(<span class="hljs-string">"Book1"</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> rng = wb.Worksheets(<span class="hljs-string">"Sheet1"</span>).Range(<span class="hljs-string">"A1"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>If you <em>do</em> want to work with the <code>ActiveWorkbook</code>, for clarity it's best to be explicit. But take care, as many <code>WorkBook</code> methods change the active book.</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> rng = ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets(<span class="hljs-string">"Sheet1"</span>).Range(<span class="hljs-string">"A1"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use the <code>ThisWorkbook</code> object to refer to the book containing the running code.</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> rng = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(<span class="hljs-string">"Sheet1"</span>).Range(<span class="hljs-string">"A1"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>A common (bad) piece of code is to open a book, get some data then close again</p>
<p>This is bad:</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">Sub</span> foo()
    <span class="hljs-keyword">Dim</span> v <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> Variant
    Workbooks(<span class="hljs-string">"Book1.xlsx"</span>).Sheets(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>).Range(<span class="hljs-string">"A1"</span>).Clear
    Workbooks.Open(<span class="hljs-string">"C:\Path\To\SomeClosedBook.xlsx"</span>)
    v = ActiveWorkbook.Sheets(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>).Range(<span class="hljs-string">"A1"</span>).Value
    Workbooks(<span class="hljs-string">"SomeAlreadyOpenBook.xlsx"</span>).Activate
    ActiveWorkbook.Sheets(<span class="hljs-string">"SomeSheet"</span>).Range(<span class="hljs-string">"A1"</span>).Value = v
    Workbooks(<span class="hljs-number">2</span>).Activate
    ActiveWorkbook.Close()
<span class="hljs-keyword">End</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Sub</span>

</ol>
<p><strong>How do we avoid it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Directly work with the relevant objects</p>
<p>Consider this code</p>

Range(<span class="hljs-string">"A1"</span>).<span class="hljs-keyword">Select</span>

<p>One small point of emphasis I'll add to all the excellent answers given previously:</p>
<p>Probably the biggest thing you can do to avoid using Select is to <em><strong>as much as possible, use named ranges (combined with meaningful variable names) in your VBA code</strong></em>. This point was mentioned above, but it was glossed over a bit; however, it deserves special attention.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of additional reasons to make liberal use of named ranges, though I am sure I could think of more.</p>
<h2>Named ranges make your code easier to read and understand.</h2>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">Dim</span> Months <span class="hljs-keyword">As</span> Range
<span class="hljs-keyword">Dim</span> MonthlySales <span class="hljs-keyword">As</span> Range

<span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> Months = Range(<span class="hljs-string">"Months"</span>)
<span class="hljs-comment">' E.g, "Months" might be a named range referring to A1:A12</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> MonthlySales = Range(<span class="hljs-string">"MonthlySales"</span>)
<span class="hljs-comment">' E.g, "Monthly Sales" might be a named range referring to B1:B12</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">Dim</span> Month <span class="hljs-keyword">As</span> Range
<span class="hljs-keyword">For</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Each</span> Month <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> Months
    Debug.Print MonthlySales(Month.Row)
<span class="hljs-keyword">Next</span> Month
</code></pre>
<p>It is pretty obvious what the named ranges <code>Months</code> and <code>MonthlySales</code> contain, and what the procedure is doing.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Partially because it is easier for other people to understand it, but even if you are the only person who will ever see or use your code, you should still use named ranges and good variable names because <em><strong>you will forget</strong></em> what you meant to do with it a year later, and <em><strong>you will waste</strong></em> 30 minutes just figuring out what your code is doing.</p>
<h2>Named ranges ensure that your macros do not break when (not if!) the configuration of the spreadsheet changes.</h2>
<p>Consider, if the above example had been written like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">Dim</span> rng1 <span class="hljs-keyword">As</span> Range
<span class="hljs-keyword">Dim</span> rng2 <span class="hljs-keyword">As</span> Range

<span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> rng1 = Range(<span class="hljs-string">"A1:A12"</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> rng2 = Range(<span class="hljs-string">"B1:B12"</span>)

<span class="hljs-keyword">Dim</span> rng3 <span class="hljs-keyword">As</span> Range
<span class="hljs-keyword">For</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Each</span> rng3 <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> rng1
    Debug.Print rng2(rng3.Row)
<span class="hljs-keyword">Next</span> rng3
</code></pre>
<p>This code will work just fine at first - that is until you or a future user decides "gee wiz, I think I'm going to add a new column with the year in Column <code>A</code>!", or put an expenses column between the months and sales columns, or add a header to each column. Now, your code is broken. And because you used terrible variable names, it will take you a lot more time to figure out how to fix it than it should take.</p>
<p>If you had used named ranges to begin with, the <code>Months</code> and <code>Sales</code> columns could be moved around all you like, and your code would continue working just fine.</p>

<p>I'm going to give the short answer since everyone else gave the long one.</p>

<p>You'll get .select and .activate whenever you record macros and reuse them.  When you .select a cell or sheet it just makes it active.  From that point on whenever you use unqualified references like <code>Range.Value</code> they just use the active cell and sheet.  This can also be problematic if you don't watch where your code is placed or a user clicks on the workbook.</p>

<p>So, you can eliminate these issues by directly referencing your cells.  Which goes:</p>

<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-comment">'create and set a range</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">Dim</span> Rng <span class="hljs-keyword">As</span> Excel.Range
<span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> Rng = Workbooks(<span class="hljs-string">"Book1"</span>).Worksheets(<span class="hljs-string">"Sheet1"</span>).Range(<span class="hljs-string">"A1"</span>)
<span class="hljs-comment">'OR</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> Rng = Workbooks(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>).Worksheets(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>).Cells(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>Or you could</p>

<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-comment">'Just deal with the cell directly rather than creating a range</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">'I want to put the string "Hello" in Range A1 of sheet 1</span>
Workbooks(<span class="hljs-string">"Book1"</span>).Worksheets(<span class="hljs-string">"Sheet1"</span>).Range(<span class="hljs-string">"A1"</span>).value = <span class="hljs-string">"Hello"</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">'OR</span>
Workbooks(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>).Worksheets(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>).Cells(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>).value = <span class="hljs-string">"Hello"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>There are various combinations of these methods, but that would be the general idea expressed as shortly as possible for impatient people like me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"... and am finding that my code would be more re-usable if I were able to use variables instead of Select functions."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I cannot think of any more than an isolated handful of situations where <code>.Select</code> would be a better choice than direct cell referencing, I would rise to the defense of <code>Selection</code> and point out that it should not be thrown out for the same reasons that <code>.Select</code> should be avoided.</p>

<p>There are times when having short, time-saving macro sub routines assigned to hot-key combinations available with the tap of a couple of keys saves a lot of time. Being able to select a group of cells to enact the operational code on works wonders when dealing with pocketed data that does not conform to a worksheet-wide data format. Much in the same way that you might select a group of cells and apply a format change, selecting a group of cells to run special macro code against can be a major time saver.</p>

<p>The actual code to process could be anything from a single line to multiple modules. I have used this method to initiate long running routines on a ragged selection of cells containing the filenames of external workbooks.</p>

<p>In short, don't discard <code>Selection</code> due to its close association with <code>.Select</code> and <code>ActiveCell</code>. As a worksheet property it has many other purposes.</p>

<p><sub>(Yes, I know this question was about <code>.Select</code>, not <code>Selection</code> but I wanted to remove any misconceptions that novice VBA coders might infer.)</sub></p>

<p>Avoiding <code>Select</code> and <code>Activate</code> is the move that makes you a bit better VBA developer. In general, <code>Select</code> and <code>Activate</code> are used when a macro is recorded, thus the <code>Parent</code> worksheet or range is always considered the active one.</p>

<p>This is probably the most common mistake in <a href="/questions/tagged/vba" class="post-tag" title="show questions tagged 'vba'" rel="tag">vba</a>. Whenever you copy ranges, sometimes the worksheet is not referenced and thus VBA considers the wrong sheet the ActiveWorksheet.</p>

<h2>Can I really never use <code>.Select</code> or <code>.Activate</code> for anything?</h2>

<ul>
<li>A good example of when you could be justified in using <code>.Activate</code> and <code>.Select</code> is when you want make sure that a specific Worksheet is selected for visual reasons. E.g., that your Excel would always open with the cover worksheet selected first, disregarding which which was the ActiveSheet when the file was closed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, something like the code below is absolutely OK:</p>

<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">Private</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Sub</span> Workbook_Open()
    Worksheets(<span class="hljs-string">"Cover"</span>).Activate
<span class="hljs-keyword">End</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Sub</span>
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>Another good example is when you need to export all sheets into one PDF file, as mentioned in this case - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59107554/how-to-avoid-select-active-statements-in-vba-in-this-example">How to avoid select/active statements in VBA in this example?</a></p></li>
<li><p>When a command only works with <code>ActiveWindow</code> like <a href="https://github.com/Vitosh/VBA_personal/blob/master/Boilerplate/Boilerplate%20VitoshAcademy/tblInput.vb" rel="noreferrer">ActiveWindow.Zoom</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Vitosh/VBA_personal/blob/master/Boilerplate/Boilerplate%20VitoshAcademy/ExcelAdditional.bas" rel="noreferrer">ActiveWindow.FreezePanes</a></p></li>

<p>Please note that in the following I'm comparing the Select approach (the one that the OP wants to avoid), with the Range approach (and this is the answer to the question). So don't stop reading when you see the first Select.</p>
<p>It really depends on what you are trying to do. Anyway, a simple example could be useful. Let's suppose that you want to set the value of the active cell to "foo". Using ActiveCell you would write something like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">Sub</span> Macro1()
    ActiveCell.Value = <span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">End</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Sub</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to use it for a cell that is not the active one, for instance for "B2", you should select it first, like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">Sub</span> Macro2()
    Range(<span class="hljs-string">"B2"</span>).<span class="hljs-keyword">Select</span>
    Macro1
<span class="hljs-keyword">End</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Sub</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Using Ranges you can write a more generic macro that can be used to set the value of any cell you want to whatever you want:</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">Sub</span> SetValue(cellAddress <span class="hljs-keyword">As</span> <span class="hljs-type">String</span>, aVal <span class="hljs-keyword">As</span> Variant)
    Range(cellAddress).Value = aVal
<span class="hljs-keyword">End</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Sub</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Then you can rewrite Macro2 as:</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">Sub</span> Macro2()
    SetCellValue <span class="hljs-string">"B2"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">End</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Sub</span>
</code></pre>
<p>And Macro1 as:</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">Sub</span> Macro1()
    SetValue ActiveCell.Address, <span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">End</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Sub</span>

<p>These methods are rather stigmatized, so taking the lead <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10714251/how-to-avoid-using-select-in-excel-vba/35864330#35864330">of Vityata</a> and Jeeped for the sake of drawing a line in the sand:</p>
<h2>Call <code>.Activate</code>, <code>.Select</code>, <code>Selection</code>, <code>ActiveSomething</code> methods/properties</h2>
<p>Basically because they're called primarily to handle user input through the application UI. Since they're the methods called when the user handles objects through the UI, they're the ones recorded by the macro-recorder, and that's why calling them is either brittle or redundant for most situations: you don't have to select an object so as to perform an action with <code>Selection</code> right afterwards.</p>
<p>However, this definition settles situations on which they are called for:</p>
<h2>When to call <code>.Activate</code>, <code>.Select</code>, <code>.Selection</code>, <code>.ActiveSomething</code> methods/properties</h2>
<p>Basically when you expect the <em>final user</em> to play a role in the execution.</p>
<p>If you are developing and expect the user to choose the object instances for your code to handle, then <code>.Selection</code> or <code>.ActiveObject</code> are apropriate.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <code>.Select</code> and <code>.Activate</code> are of use when you can infer the user's next action and you want your code to guide the user, possibly saving him/her some time and mouse clicks. For example, if your code just created a brand new instance of a chart or updated one, the user might want to check it out, and you could call <code>.Activate</code> on it or its sheet to save the user the time searching for it; or if you know the user will need to update some range values, you can programmatically select that range.</p>

<p>IMHO use of <code>.select</code> comes from people, who like me started learning VBA by necessity through recording macros and then modifying the code without realizing that <code>.select</code> and subsequent <code>selection</code> is just an unnecessary middle-men.</p>

<p><code>.select</code> can be avoided, as many posted already, by directly working with the already existing objects, which allows various indirect referencing like calculating i and j in a complex way and then editing cell(i,j), etc.</p>

<p>Otherwise, there is nothing implicitly wrong with <code>.select</code> itself and you can find uses for this easily, e.g. I have a spreadsheet that I populate with date, activate macro that does some magic with it and exports it in an acceptable format on a separate sheet, which, however, requires some final manual (unpredictable) inputs into an adjacent cell. So here comes the moment for <code>.select</code> that saves me that additional mouse movement and click.</p>

<p>To avoid using the <code>.Select</code> method, you can set a variable equal to the property that you want.</p>

<ul>
<li>Example <code>valOne = Range("A1").Value</code></li>
</ul>
<p> For instance, if you want the codename of 'Sheet3<code>you could set a variable equal to the</code>Codename` property of that worksheet.</p>

<h1>How to avoid copy-paste?</h1>
<p>Let's face it: this one appears a lot when recording macros:</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet">Range(<span class="hljs-string">"X1"</span>).<span class="hljs-keyword">Select</span>
Selection.Copy
Range(<span class="hljs-string">"Y9).Select
Selection.Paste
</span></code></pre>
<p>While the only thing the person wants is:</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet">Range(<span class="hljs-string">"Y9"</span>).Value = Range(<span class="hljs-string">"X1"</span>).Value
</code></pre>
<p>Therefore, instead of using copy-paste in VBA macros, I'd advise the following simple approach:</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet">Destination_Range.Value = Source_Range.Value
</code></pre>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution13" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl solution-inner border md:px-10 md:py-10 px-2 py-10 shadow-md bg-white"><div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-between"><h4 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 13</h4><div class="tags-wrap h-max space-x-8"><div class="tags"><a class="rounded-2xl border bg-neutral-100 px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold whitespace-nowrap" href="/questions/tag/excel">excel</a><a class="rounded-2xl border bg-neutral-100 px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold whitespace-nowrap" href="/questions/tag/vba">vba</a></div></div></div><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>I noticed that none of these answers mention the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vba/excel-vba/articles/range-offset-property-excel" rel="noreferrer">.Offset Property</a>. This also can be used to avoid using the <code>Select</code> action when manipulating certain cells, particularly in reference to a selected cell (as the OP mentions with <code>ActiveCell</code>).</p>

<p>Here are a couple examples.</p>

<p>I will also assume the "ActiveCell" is <strong>J4</strong>.</p>

<p><code>ActiveCell.Offset(2, 0).Value = 12</code></p>

<ul>
<li>This will change the cell <code>J6</code> to be a value of 12 </li>
<li>A minus -2 would have referenced J2</li>
</ul>

<p><code>ActiveCell.Offset(0,1).Copy ActiveCell.Offset(,2)</code></p>

<ul>
<li>This will copy the cell in <code>k4</code> to <code>L4</code>.</li>
<li>Note that "0" is not needed in the offset parameter if not needed (,2)</li>
<li>Similar to the previous example a minus 1 would be <code>i4</code></li>
</ul>

<p><code>ActiveCell.Offset(, -1).EntireColumn.ClearContents</code></p>

<ul>
<li>This will clear values in all cells in the column k.</li>
</ul>

<p>These aren't to say they are "better" than the above options, but just listing alternatives.</p>

<p>The main reason never to use Select or Activesheet is because most people will have at least another couple of workbooks open (sometimes dozens) when they run your macro, and if they click away from your sheet while your macro is running and click on some other book they have open, then the "Activesheet" changes, and the target workbook for an unqualified "Select" command changes as well.</p>
<p>At best, your macro will crash, at worst you might end up writing values or changing cells in the wrong workbook with no way to "Undo" them.</p>
<p>I have a simple golden rule that I follow: Add variables named "wb" and "ws" for a Workbook object and a Worksheet object and always use those to refer to my macro book. If I need to refer to more than one book, or more than one sheet, I add more variables.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-keyword">Dim</span> wb <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> Workbook
<span class="hljs-keyword">Dim</span> ws <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> Worksheet
<span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> wb = ThisWorkBook
<span class="hljs-keyword">Set</span> ws = wb.sheets(<span class="hljs-string">"Output"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>The "Set wb = ThisWorkbook" command is absolutely key. "ThisWorkbook" is a special value in Excel, and it means the workbook that your VBA code is <em>currently running from</em>. A very helpful shortcut to set your Workbook variable with.</p>
<p>After you've done that at the top of your Sub, using them could not be simpler, just use them wherever you would use "Selection":</p>
<p>So to change the value of cell "A1" in "Output" to "Hello", instead of:</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet">Sheets(<span class="hljs-string">"Output"</span>).Activate
ActiveSheet.Range(<span class="hljs-string">"A1"</span>).<span class="hljs-keyword">Select</span>
Selection.Value = <span class="hljs-string">"Hello"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>We can now do this:</p>
<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet">ws.Range(<span class="hljs-string">"A1"</span>).Value = <span class="hljs-string">"Hello"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Which is not only much more reliable and less likely to crash if the user is working with multiple spreadsheets; it's also much shorter, quicker and easier to write.</p>
<p>As an added bonus, if you <em>always</em> name your variables "wb" and "ws", you can copy and paste code from one book to another and it will usually work with minimal changes needed, if any.</p>
