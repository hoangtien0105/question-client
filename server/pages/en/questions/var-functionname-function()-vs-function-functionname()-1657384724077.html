Example:\n\nfunction xyz(){\n  function abc(){};\n  // abc is defined here...\n}\n// ...but not here\n\n\nSecondly, it is possible to combine both styles:\n\nvar xyz = function abc(){};\n\n\nxyz is going to be defined as usual, abc is undefined in all browsers but Internet Explorer  do not rely on it being defined. But it will be defined inside its body:\n\nvar xyz = function abc(){\n  // xyz is visible here\n  // abc is visible here\n}\n// xyz is visible here\n// abc is undefined here\n\n\nIf you want to alias functions on all browsers, use this kind of declaration:\n\nfunction abc(){};\nvar xyz = abc;\n\n\nIn this case, both xyz and abc are aliases of the same object:\n\nconsole.log(xyz === abc); // prints &quot;true&quot;\n\n\nOne compelling reason to use the combined style is the &quot;name&quot; attribute of function objects (not supported by Internet Explorer). Basically when you define a function like\n\nfunction abc(){};\nconsole.log(abc.name); // prints &quot;abc&quot;\n\n\nits name is automatically assigned. But when you define it like\n\nvar abc = function(){};\nconsole.log(abc.name); // prints &quot;&quot;\n\n\nits name is empty  we created an anonymous function and assigned it to some variable.\n\nAnother good reason to use the combined style is to use a short internal name to refer to itself, while providing a long non-conflicting name for external users:\n\n// Assume really.long.external.scoped is {}\nreally.long.external.scoped.name = function shortcut(n){\n  // Let it call itself recursively:\n  shortcut(n - 1);\n  // ...\n  // Let it pass itself as a callback:\n  someFunction(shortcut);\n  // ...\n}\n\n\nIn the example above we can do the same with an external name, but it&apos;ll be too unwieldy (and slower).\n\n(Another way to refer to itself is to use arguments.callee, which is still relatively long, and not supported in the strict mode.)\n\nDeep down, JavaScript treats both statements differently. This is a function declaration:\n\nfunction abc(){}\n\n\nabc here is defined everywhere in the current scope:\n\n// We can call it here\nabc(); // Works\n\n// Yet, it is defined down there.\nfunction abc(){}\n\n// We can call it again\nabc(); // Works\n\n\nAlso, it hoisted through a return statement:\n\n// We can call it here\nabc(); // Works\nreturn;\nfunction abc(){}\n\n\nThis is a function expression:\n\nvar xyz = function(){};\n\n\nxyz here is defined from the point of assignment:\n\n// We can&apos;t call it here\nxyz(); // UNDEFINED!!!\n\n// Now it is defined\nxyz = function(){}\n\n// We can call it here\nxyz(); // works\n\n\nFunction declaration vs. function expression is the real reason why there is a difference demonstrated by Greg.\n\nFun fact:\n\nvar xyz = function abc(){};\nconsole.log(xyz.name); // Prints &quot;abc&quot;\n\n\nPersonally, I prefer the &quot;function expression&quot; declaration because this way I can control the visibility. When I define the function like\n\nvar abc = function(){};\n\n\nI know that I defined the function locally. When I define the function like\n\nabc = function(){};\n\n\nI know that I defined it globally providing that I didn&apos;t define abc anywhere in the chain of scopes. This style of definition is resilient even when used inside eval(). While the definition\n\nfunction abc(){};\n\n\ndepends on the context and may leave you guessing where it is actually defined, especially in the case of eval()  the answer is: It depends on the browser.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Here&apos;s the rundown on the standard forms that create functions: (Originally written for another question, but adapted after being moved into the canonical question.)\n\nTerms:\n\n\nES5: ECMAScript 5th edition, 2009\nES2015: ECMAScript 2015 (also known as &quot;ES6&quot;)\n\n\nThe quick list:\n\n\nFunction Declaration\n&quot;Anonymous&quot; function Expression (which despite the term, sometimes create functions with names)\nNamed function Expression\nAccessor Function Initializer (ES5+)\nArrow Function Expression (ES2015+) (which, like anonymous function expressions, don&apos;t involve an explicit name, and yet can create functions with names)\nMethod Declaration in Object Initializer (ES2015+)\nConstructor and Method Declarations in class (ES2015+)\n\n\nFunction Declaration\n\nThe first form is a function declaration, which looks like this:\n\nfunction x() {\n    console.log(&apos;x&apos;);\n}\n\n\nA function declaration is a declaration; it&apos;s not a statement or expression. As such, you don&apos;t follow it with a ; (although doing so is harmless).\n\nA function declaration is processed when execution enters the context in which it appears, before any step-by-step code is executed. The function it creates is given a proper name (x in the example above), and that name is put in the scope in which the declaration appears.\n\nBecause it&apos;s processed before any step-by-step code in the same context, you can do things like this:\n\nx(); // Works even though it&apos;s above the declaration\nfunction x() {\n    console.log(&apos;x&apos;);\n}\n\n\nUntil ES2015, the spec didn&apos;t cover what a JavaScript engine should do if you put a function declaration inside a control structure like try, if, switch, while, etc., like this:\n\nif (someCondition) {\n    function foo() {    // &lt;===== HERE THERE\n    }                   // &lt;===== BE DRAGONS\n}\n\n\nAnd since they&apos;re processed before step-by-step code is run, it&apos;s tricky to know what to do when they&apos;re in a control structure.\n\nAlthough doing this wasn&apos;t specified until ES2015, it was an allowable extension to support function declarations in blocks. Unfortunately (and inevitably), different engines did different things.\n\nAs of ES2015, the specification says what to do. In fact, it gives three separate things to do:\n\n\nIf in loose mode not on a web browser, the JavaScript engine is supposed to do one thing\nIf in loose mode on a web browser, the JavaScript engine is supposed to do something else\nIf in strict mode (browser or not), the JavaScript engine is supposed to do yet another thing\n\n\nThe rules for the loose modes are tricky, but in strict mode, function declarations in blocks are easy: They&apos;re local to the block (they have block scope, which is also new in ES2015), and they&apos;re hoisted to the top of the block. So:\n\n&quot;use strict&quot;;\nif (someCondition) {\n    foo();               // Works just fine\n    function foo() {\n    }\n}\nconsole.log(typeof foo); // &quot;undefined&quot; (`foo` is not in scope here\n                         // because it&apos;s not in the same block)\n\n\n&quot;Anonymous&quot; function Expression\n\nThe second common form is called an anonymous function expression:\n\nvar y = function () {\n    console.log(&apos;y&apos;);\n};\n\n\nLike all expressions, it&apos;s evaluated when it&apos;s reached in the step-by-step execution of the code.\n\nIn ES5, the function this creates has no name (it&apos;s anonymous). In ES2015, the function is assigned a name if possible by inferring it from context. In the example above, the name would be y. Something similar is done when the function is the value of a property initializer. (For details on when this happens and the rules, search for SetFunctionName in the the specification  it appears all over the place.)\n\nNamed function Expression\n\nThe third form is a named function expression (&quot;NFE&quot;):\n\nvar z = function w() {\n    console.log(&apos;zw&apos;)\n};\n\n\nThe function this creates has a proper name (w in this case). Like all expressions, this is evaluated when it&apos;s reached in the step-by-step execution of the code. The name of the function is not added to the scope in which the expression appears; the name is in scope within the function itself:\n\nvar z = function w() {\n    console.log(typeof w); // &quot;function&quot;\n};\nconsole.log(typeof w);     // &quot;undefined&quot;\n\n\nNote that NFEs have frequently been a source of bugs for JavaScript implementations. IE8 and earlier, for instance, handle NFEs completely incorrectly, creating two different functions at two different times. Early versions of Safari had issues as well. The good news is that current versions of browsers (IE9 and up, current Safari) don&apos;t have those issues any more. (But as of this writing, sadly, IE8 remains in widespread use, and so using NFEs with code for the web in general is still problematic.)\n\nAccessor Function Initializer (ES5+)\n\nSometimes functions can sneak in largely unnoticed; that&apos;s the case with accessor functions. Here&apos;s an example:\n\nvar obj = {\n    value: 0,\n    get f() {\n        return this.value;\n    },\n    set f(v) {\n        this.value = v;\n    }\n};\nconsole.log(obj.f);         // 0\nconsole.log(typeof obj.f);  // &quot;number&quot;\n\n\nNote that when I used the function, I didn&apos;t use ()! That&apos;s because it&apos;s an accessor function for a property. We get and set the property in the normal way, but behind the scenes, the function is called.\n\nYou can also create accessor functions with Object.defineProperty, Object.defineProperties, and the lesser-known second argument to Object.create.\n\nArrow Function Expression (ES2015+)\n\nES2015 brings us the arrow function. Here&apos;s one example:\n\nvar a = [1, 2, 3];\nvar b = a.map(n =&gt; n * 2);\nconsole.log(b.join(&quot;, &quot;)); // 2, 4, 6\n\n\nSee that n =&gt; n * 2 thing hiding in the map() call? That&apos;s a function.\n\nA couple of things about arrow functions:\n\n\nThey don&apos;t have their own this. Instead, they close over the this of the context where they&apos;re defined. (They also close over arguments and, where relevant, super.) This means that the this within them is the same as the this where they&apos;re created, and cannot be changed.\nAs you&apos;ll have noticed with the above, you don&apos;t use the keyword function; instead, you use =&gt;.\n\n\nThe n =&gt; n * 2 example above is one form of them. If you have multiple arguments to pass the function, you use parens:\n\nvar a = [1, 2, 3];\nvar b = a.map((n, i) =&gt; n * i);\nconsole.log(b.join(&quot;, &quot;)); // 0, 2, 6\n\n\n(Remember that Array#map passes the entry as the first argument, and the index as the second.)\n\nIn both cases, the body of the function is just an expression; the function&apos;s return value will automatically be the result of that expression (you don&apos;t use an explicit return).\n\nIf you&apos;re doing more than just a single expression, use {} and an explicit return (if you need to return a value), as normal:\n\nvar a = [\n  {first: &quot;Joe&quot;, last: &quot;Bloggs&quot;},\n  {first: &quot;Albert&quot;, last: &quot;Bloggs&quot;},\n  {first: &quot;Mary&quot;, last: &quot;Albright&quot;}\n];\na = a.sort((a, b) =&gt; {\n  var rv = a.last.localeCompare(b.last);\n  if (rv === 0) {\n    rv = a.first.localeCompare(b.first);\n  }\n  return rv;\n});\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(a));\n\n\nThe version without { ... } is called an arrow function with an expression body or concise body. (Also: A concise arrow function.) The one with { ... } defining the body is an arrow function with a function body. (Also: A verbose arrow function.)\n\nMethod Declaration in Object Initializer (ES2015+)\n\nES2015 allows a shorter form of declaring a property that references a function called a method definition; it looks like this:\n\nvar o = {\n    foo() {\n    }\n};\n\n\nthe almost-equivalent in ES5 and earlier would be:\n\nvar o = {\n    foo: function foo() {\n    }\n};\n\n\nthe difference (other than verbosity) is that a method can use super, but a function cannot. So for instance, if you had an object that defined (say) valueOf using method syntax, it could use super.valueOf() to get the value Object.prototype.valueOf would have returned (before presumably doing something else with it), whereas the ES5 version would have to do Object.prototype.valueOf.call(this) instead.\n\nThat also means that the method has a reference to the object it was defined on, so if that object is temporary (for instance, you&apos;re passing it into Object.assign as one of the source objects), method syntax could mean that the object is retained in memory when otherwise it could have been garbage collected (if the JavaScript engine doesn&apos;t detect that situation and handle it if none of the methods uses super).\n\nConstructor and Method Declarations in class (ES2015+)\n\nES2015 brings us class syntax, including declared constructors and methods:\n\nclass Person {\n    constructor(firstName, lastName) {\n        this.firstName = firstName;\n        this.lastName = lastName;\n    }\n\n    getFullName() {\n        return this.firstName + &quot; &quot; + this.lastName;\n    }\n}\n\n\nThere are two function declarations above: One for the constructor, which gets the name Person, and one for getFullName, which is a function assigned to Person.prototype.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Speaking about the global context, both, the var statement and a FunctionDeclaration at the end will create a non-deleteable property on the global object, but the value of both can be overwritten.\n\nThe subtle difference between the two ways is that when the Variable Instantiation process runs (before the actual code execution) all identifiers declared with var will be initialized with undefined, and the ones used by the FunctionDeclaration&apos;s will be available since that moment, for example:\n\n alert(typeof foo); // &apos;function&apos;, it&apos;s already available\n alert(typeof bar); // &apos;undefined&apos;\n function foo () {}\n var bar = function () {};\n alert(typeof bar); // &apos;function&apos;\n\n\nThe assignment of the bar FunctionExpression takes place until runtime.\n\nA global property created by a FunctionDeclaration can be overwritten without any problems just like a variable value, e.g.:\n\n function test () {}\n test = null;\n\n\nAnother obvious difference between your two examples is that the first function doesn&apos;t have a name, but the second has it, which can be really useful when debugging (i.e. inspecting a call stack).\n\nAbout your edited first example (foo = function() { alert(&apos;hello!&apos;); };), it is an undeclared assignment, I would highly encourage you to always use the var keyword.\n\nWith an assignment, without the var statement, if the referenced identifier is not found in the scope chain, it will become a deleteable property of the global object.\n\nAlso, undeclared assignments throw a ReferenceError on ECMAScript 5 under Strict Mode.\n\nA must read:\n\n\nNamed function expressions demystified\n\n\nNote: This answer has been merged from another question, in which the major doubt and misconception from the OP was that identifiers declared with a FunctionDeclaration, couldn&apos;t be overwritten which is not the case.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"The two code snippets you&apos;ve posted there will, for almost all purposes, behave the same way.\n\nHowever, the difference in behaviour is that with the first variant (var functionOne = function() {}), that function can only be called after that point in the code.\n\nWith the second variant (function functionTwo()), the function is available to code that runs above where the function is declared.\n\nThis is because with the first variant, the function is assigned to the variable foo at run time. In the second, the function is assigned to that identifier, foo, at parse time.\n\nMore technical information\n\nJavaScript has three ways of defining functions.\n\n\nYour first snippet shows a function expression. This involves using the &quot;function&quot; operator to create a function - the result of that operator can be stored in any variable or object property. The function expression is powerful that way. The function expression is often called an &quot;anonymous function&quot;, because it does not have to have a name,\nYour second example is a function declaration. This uses the &quot;function&quot; statement to create a function. The function is made available at parse time and can be called anywhere in that scope. You can still store it in a variable or object property later.\nThe third way of defining a function is the &quot;Function()&quot; constructor, which is not shown in your original post. It&apos;s not recommended to use this as it works the same way as eval(), which has its problems.\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"A better explanation to Greg&apos;s answer\nfunctionTwo();\nfunction functionTwo() {\n}\n\nWhy no error?

And, the jsben.ch tests are  found here. As you can see, there is a noticeable difference when there should be none. If you are really a performance freak like me, then it might be more worth your while trying to reduce the number of variables and functions in the scope and especially eliminating polymorphism (such as using the same variable to store two different types).\n\nVariable Mutability\n\nWhen you use the var keyword to declare a variable, you can then reassign a different value to the variable like so.\n\n\n(function(){\n    &quot;use strict&quot;;\n    var foobar = function(){}; // initial value\n    try {\n        foobar = &quot;Hello World!&quot;; // new value\n        console.log(&quot;[no error]&quot;);\n    } catch(error) {\n        console.log(&quot;ERROR: &quot; + error.message);\n    }\n    console.log(foobar, window.foobar);\n})();\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\nHowever, when we use the const-statement, the variable reference becomes immutable. This means that we cannot assign a new value to the variable. Please note, however, that this does not make the contents of the variable immutable: if you do const arr = [], then you can still do arr[10] = &quot;example&quot;. Only doing something like arr = &quot;new value&quot; or arr = [] would throw an error as seen below.\n\n\n(function(){\n    &quot;use strict&quot;;\n    const foobar = function(){}; // initial value\n    try {\n        foobar = &quot;Hello World!&quot;; // new value\n        console.log(&quot;[no error]&quot;);\n    } catch(error) {\n        console.log(&quot;ERROR: &quot; + error.message);\n    }\n    console.log(foobar, window.foobar);\n})();\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\nInterestingly, if we declare the variable as function funcName(){}, then the immutability of the variable is the same as declaring it with var.\n\n\n(function(){\n    &quot;use strict&quot;;\n    function foobar(){}; // initial value\n    try {\n        foobar = &quot;Hello World!&quot;; // new value\n        console.log(&quot;[no error]&quot;);\n    } catch(error) {\n        console.log(&quot;ERROR: &quot; + error.message);\n    }\n    console.log(foobar, window.foobar);\n})();\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n   &quot; &quot;\nThe &quot;nearest block&quot; is the nearest &quot;function,&quot; (including asynchronous functions, generator functions, and asynchronous generator functions).

This difference is due to the mechanism called variable hoisting in JavaScript.\n\nBasically, all function declarations and variable declarations are hoisted to the top of the function in which the declaration occurs (this is why we say that JavaScript has function scope).\n\n\nWhen a function declaration is hoisted, the function body &quot;follows&quot;\nso when the function body is evaluated, the variable will immediately\nbe bound to a function object.\nWhen a variable declaration is hoisted, the initialization does not\nfollow, but is &quot;left behind&quot;. The variable is initialized to\nundefined at the start of the function body, and will be assigned\na value at its original location in the code. (Actually, it will be assigned a value at every location where a declaration of a variable with the same name occurs.)\n\n\nThe order of hoisting is also important: function declarations take precedence over variable declarations with the same name, and the last function declaration takes precedence over previous function declarations with the same name.\n\nSome examples...\n\nvar foo = 1;\nfunction bar() {\n  if (!foo) {\n    var foo = 10 }\n  return foo; }\nbar() // 10\n\n\nVariable foo is hoisted to the top of the function, initialized to undefined, so that !foo is true, so foo is assigned 10.

Declarations must start with var, Function\n  Declarations must begin with function.\n\n\nThis is the normal way of calling a function in JavaScript, this function can be called before you even declare it as in JavaScript all functions get Hoisted, but if you have &apos;use strict&apos; this won&apos;t Hoist as expected, it&apos;s a good way to call all normal functions which are not big in lines and neither are a  constructor function.\n\nAlso, if you need more info about how hoisting works in JavaScript, visit the link

<p>I've recently started maintaining someone else's JavaScript code. I'm fixing bugs, adding features and also trying to tidy up the code and make it more consistent.</p>
<p>The previous developer used two ways of declaring functions and I can't work out if there is a reason behind it or not.</p>
<p>The two ways are:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> functionOne = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Some code</span>
};
</code></pre>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">functionTwo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Some code</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>What are the reasons for using these two different methods and what are the pros and cons of each? Is there anything that can be done with one method that can't be done with the other?</p>

<p>The difference is that <code>functionOne</code> is a function expression and so only defined when that line is reached, whereas <code>functionTwo</code> is a function declaration and is defined as soon as its surrounding function or script is executed (due to <a href="http://adripofjavascript.com/blog/drips/variable-and-function-hoisting.html" rel="noreferrer">hoisting</a>).  </p>

<p>For example, a function expression:</p>

<p></p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// TypeError: functionOne is not a function</span>

  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello!"</span>);
};</code></pre>
<div class="snippet-result"><div class="snippet-ctas"><button type="button" class="s-btn s-btn__primary"><span class="icon-play-white _hover"></span><span> Run code snippet</span></button><input class="copySnippet s-btn s-btn__filled" type="button" value="Copy snippet to answer" style="display: none;"><button type="button" class="s-btn hideResults" style="display: none;">Hide results</button><div class="popout-code"><a class="snippet-expand-link">Expand snippet</a></div></div><div class="snippet-result-code" style="display: none;"><iframe name="sif1" sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-scripts" class="snippet-box-edit snippet-box-result" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></div></div>
</div>
<p></p>

<p>And, a function declaration:   </p>

<p></p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">
<div class="snippet-code">

<p>Historically, function declarations defined within blocks were handled inconsistently between browsers. Strict mode (introduced in ES5) resolved this by scoping function declarations to their enclosing block.</p>

<p>First I want to correct Greg: <code>function abc(){}</code> is scoped too  the name <code>abc</code> is defined in the scope where this definition is encountered. Example:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">xyz</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
  <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">abc</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){};
  <span class="hljs-comment">// abc is defined here...</span>
}
<span class="hljs-comment">// ...but not here</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Secondly, it is possible to combine both styles:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> xyz = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">abc</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){};
</code></pre>

<p><code>xyz</code> is going to be defined as usual, <code>abc</code> is undefined in all browsers but Internet&nbsp;Explorer  do not rely on it being defined. But it will be defined inside its body:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> xyz = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">abc</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
  <span class="hljs-comment">// xyz is visible here</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">// abc is visible here</span>
}
<span class="hljs-comment">// xyz is visible here</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// abc is undefined here</span>
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to alias functions on all browsers, use this kind of declaration:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">abc</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){};
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> xyz = abc;
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, both <code>xyz</code> and <code>abc</code> are aliases of the same object:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(xyz === abc); <span class="hljs-comment">// prints "true"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>One compelling reason to use the combined style is the "name" attribute of function objects (<strong>not supported by Internet&nbsp;Explorer</strong>). Basically when you define a function like</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">abc</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){};
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(abc.<span class="hljs-property">name</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// prints "abc"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>its name is automatically assigned. But when you define it like</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> abc = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){};
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(abc.<span class="hljs-property">name</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// prints ""</span>
</code></pre>

<p>its name is empty  we created an anonymous function and assigned it to some variable.</p>

<p>Another good reason to use the combined style is to use a short internal name to refer to itself, while providing a long non-conflicting name for external users:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// Assume really.long.external.scoped is {}</span>
really.<span class="hljs-property">long</span>.<span class="hljs-property">external</span>.<span class="hljs-property">scoped</span>.<span class="hljs-property">name</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">shortcut</span>(<span class="hljs-params">n</span>){
  <span class="hljs-comment">// Let it call itself recursively:</span>
  <span class="hljs-title function_">shortcut</span>(n - <span class="hljs-number">1</span>);
  <span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">// Let it pass itself as a callback:</span>
  <span class="hljs-title function_">someFunction</span>(shortcut);
  <span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the example above we can do the same with an external name, but it'll be too unwieldy (and slower).</p>

<p><em>(Another way to refer to itself is to use <code>arguments.callee</code>, which is still relatively long, and not supported in the strict mode.)</em></p>

<p>Deep down, JavaScript treats both statements differently. This is a function declaration:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">abc</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){}
</code></pre>

<p><code>abc</code> here is defined everywhere in the current scope:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// We can call it here</span>
<span class="hljs-title function_">abc</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// Works</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">// Yet, it is defined down there.</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">abc</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){}

<span class="hljs-comment">// We can call it again</span>
<span class="hljs-title function_">abc</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// Works</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Also, it hoisted through a <code>return</code> statement:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// We can call it here</span>
<span class="hljs-title function_">abc</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// Works</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">return</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">abc</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a function expression:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> xyz = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){};
</code></pre>

<p><code>xyz</code> here is defined from the point of assignment:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// We can't call it here</span>
<span class="hljs-title function_">xyz</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// UNDEFINED!!!</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">// Now it is defined</span>
xyz = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){}

<span class="hljs-comment">// We can call it here</span>
<span class="hljs-title function_">xyz</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// works</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Function declaration vs. function expression is the real reason why there is a difference demonstrated by Greg.</p>

<p>Fun fact:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> xyz = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">abc</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){};
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(xyz.<span class="hljs-property">name</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// Prints "abc"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Personally, I prefer the "function expression" declaration because this way I can control the visibility. When I define the function like</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> abc = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){};
</code></pre>

<p>I know that I defined the function locally. When I define the function like</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">abc = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){};
</code></pre>

<p>I know that I defined it globally providing that I didn't define <code>abc</code> anywhere in the chain of scopes. This style of definition is resilient even when used inside <code>eval()</code>. While the definition</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">abc</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){};
</code></pre>

<p>depends on the context and may leave you guessing where it is actually defined, especially in the case of <code>eval()</code>  the answer is: It depends on the browser.</p>

<p>Here's the rundown on the standard forms that create functions: <em>(Originally written for another question, but adapted after being moved into the canonical question.)</em></p>

<p>Terms:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ES5</strong>: <a href="http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/" rel="noreferrer">ECMAScript 5th edition</a>, 2009</li>
<li><strong>ES2015</strong>: <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html" rel="noreferrer">ECMAScript 2015</a> (also known as "ES6")</li>
</ul>

<p>The quick list:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Function Declaration</p></li>
<li><p>"Anonymous" <code>function</code> Expression <em>(which despite the term, sometimes create functions with names)</em></p></li>
<li><p>Named <code>function</code> Expression</p></li>
<li><p>Accessor Function Initializer (ES5+)</p></li>
<li><p>Arrow Function Expression (ES2015+) <em>(which, like anonymous function expressions, don't involve an explicit name, and yet can create functions with names)</em></p></li>
<li><p>Method Declaration in Object Initializer (ES2015+)</p></li>
<li><p>Constructor and Method Declarations in <code>class</code> (ES2015+)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Function Declaration</h3>

<p>The first form is a <em>function declaration</em>, which looks like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">x</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'x'</span>);
}
</code></pre>

<p>A function declaration is a <em>declaration</em>; it's not a statement or expression. As such, you don't follow it with a <code>;</code> (although doing so is harmless).</p>

<p>A function declaration is processed when execution enters the context in which it appears, <strong>before</strong> any step-by-step code is executed. The function it creates is given a proper name (<code>x</code> in the example above), and that name is put in the scope in which the declaration appears.</p>

<p>Because it's processed before any step-by-step code in the same context, you can do things like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">x</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// Works even though it's above the declaration</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">x</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'x'</span>);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Until ES2015, the spec didn't cover what a JavaScript engine should do if you put a function declaration inside a control structure like <code>try</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>switch</code>, <code>while</code>, etc., like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (someCondition) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {    <span class="hljs-comment">// &lt;===== HERE THERE</span>
    }                   <span class="hljs-comment">// &lt;===== BE DRAGONS</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>And since they're processed <em>before</em> step-by-step code is run, it's tricky to know what to do when they're in a control structure.</p>

<p>Although doing this wasn't <em>specified</em> until ES2015, it was an <em>allowable extension</em> to support function declarations in blocks. Unfortunately (and inevitably), different engines did different things.</p>

<p>As of ES2015, the specification says what to do. In fact, it gives three separate things to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>If in loose mode <em>not</em> on a web browser, the JavaScript engine is supposed to do one thing</li>
<li>If in loose mode on a web browser, the JavaScript engine is supposed to do something else</li>
<li>If in <em>strict</em> mode (browser or not), the JavaScript engine is supposed to do yet another thing</li>
</ol>

<p>The rules for the loose modes are tricky, but in <em>strict</em> mode, function declarations in blocks are easy: They're local to the block (they have <em>block scope</em>, which is also new in ES2015), and they're hoisted to the top of the block. So:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-meta">"use strict"</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (someCondition) {
    <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>();               <span class="hljs-comment">// Works just fine</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    }
}
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span> foo); <span class="hljs-comment">// "undefined" (`foo` is not in scope here</span>
                         <span class="hljs-comment">// because it's not in the same block)</span>
</code></pre>

<h3>"Anonymous" <code>function</code> Expression</h3>

<p>The second common form is called an <em>anonymous function expression</em>:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> y = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'y'</span>);
};
</code></pre>

<p>Like all expressions, it's evaluated when it's reached in the step-by-step execution of the code.</p>

<p>In ES5, the function this creates has no name (it's anonymous). In ES2015, the function is assigned a name if possible by inferring it from context. In the example above, the name would be <code>y</code>. Something similar is done when the function is the value of a property initializer. (For details on when this happens and the rules, search for <code>SetFunctionName</code> in the <a href="https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/" rel="noreferrer">the specification</a>&nbsp; it appears <em>all over</em> the place.)</p>

<h3>Named <code>function</code> Expression</h3>

<p>The third form is a <em>named function expression</em> ("NFE"):</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> z = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">w</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'zw'</span>)
};
</code></pre>

<p>The function this creates has a proper name (<code>w</code> in this case). Like all expressions, this is evaluated when it's reached in the step-by-step execution of the code. The name of the function is <em>not</em> added to the scope in which the expression appears; the name <em>is</em> in scope within the function itself:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> z = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">w</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span> w); <span class="hljs-comment">// "function"</span>
};
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span> w);     <span class="hljs-comment">// "undefined"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Note that NFEs have frequently been a source of bugs for JavaScript implementations. IE8 and earlier, for instance, handle NFEs <a href="http://blog.niftysnippets.org/2010/09/double-take.html" rel="noreferrer">completely incorrectly</a>, creating two different functions at two different times. Early versions of Safari had issues as well. The good news is that current versions of browsers (IE9 and up, current Safari) don't have those issues any more. (But as of this writing, sadly, IE8 remains in widespread use, and so using NFEs with code for the web in general is still problematic.)</p>

<h3>Accessor Function Initializer (ES5+)</h3>

<p>Sometimes functions can sneak in largely unnoticed; that's the case with <em>accessor functions</em>. Here's an example:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> obj = {
    <span class="hljs-attr">value</span>: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>,
    <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">f</span>() {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">value</span>;
    },
    <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">f</span>(<span class="hljs-params">v</span>) {
        <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">value</span> = v;
    }
};
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(obj.<span class="hljs-property">f</span>);         <span class="hljs-comment">// 0</span>
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span> obj.<span class="hljs-property">f</span>);  <span class="hljs-comment">// "number"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Note that when I used the function, I didn't use <code>()</code>! That's because it's an <em>accessor function</em> for a property. We get and set the property in the normal way, but behind the scenes, the function is called.</p>

<p>You can also create accessor functions with <code>Object.defineProperty</code>, <code>Object.defineProperties</code>, and the lesser-known second argument to <code>Object.create</code>.</p>

<h3>Arrow Function Expression (ES2015+)</h3>

<p>ES2015 brings us the <em>arrow function</em>. Here's one example:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>];
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> b = a.<span class="hljs-title function_">map</span>(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">n</span> =&gt;</span> n * <span class="hljs-number">2</span>);
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(b.<span class="hljs-title function_">join</span>(<span class="hljs-string">", "</span>)); <span class="hljs-comment">// 2, 4, 6</span>
</code></pre>

<p>See that <code>n =&gt; n * 2</code> thing hiding in the <code>map()</code> call? That's a function.</p>

<p>A couple of things about arrow functions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They don't have their own <code>this</code>. Instead, they <em>close over</em> the <code>this</code> of the context where they're defined. (They also close over <code>arguments</code> and, where relevant, <code>super</code>.) This means that the <code>this</code> within them is the same as the <code>this</code> where they're created, and cannot be changed.</p></li>
<li><p>As you'll have noticed with the above, you don't use the keyword <code>function</code>; instead, you use <code>=&gt;</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>n =&gt; n * 2</code> example above is one form of them. If you have multiple arguments to pass the function, you use parens:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>];
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> b = a.<span class="hljs-title function_">map</span>(<span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">n, i</span>) =&gt;</span> n * i);
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(b.<span class="hljs-title function_">join</span>(<span class="hljs-string">", "</span>)); <span class="hljs-comment">// 0, 2, 6</span>
</code></pre>

<p>(Remember that <code>Array#map</code> passes the entry as the first argument, and the index as the second.)</p>

<p>In both cases, the body of the function is just an expression; the function's return value will automatically be the result of that expression (you don't use an explicit <code>return</code>).</p>

<p>If you're doing more than just a single expression, use <code>{}</code> and an explicit <code>return</code> (if you need to return a value), as normal:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = [
  {<span class="hljs-attr">first</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"Joe"</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">last</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"Bloggs"</span>},
  {<span class="hljs-attr">first</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"Albert"</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">last</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"Bloggs"</span>},
  {<span class="hljs-attr">first</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"Mary"</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">last</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"Albright"</span>}
];
a = a.<span class="hljs-title function_">sort</span>(<span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">a, b</span>) =&gt;</span> {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> rv = a.<span class="hljs-property">last</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">localeCompare</span>(b.<span class="hljs-property">last</span>);
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (rv === <span class="hljs-number">0</span>) {
    rv = a.<span class="hljs-property">first</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">localeCompare</span>(b.<span class="hljs-property">first</span>);
  }
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> rv;
});
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-title class_">JSON</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">stringify</span>(a));
</code></pre>

<p>The version without <code>{ ... }</code> is called an arrow function with an <em>expression body</em> or <em>concise body</em>. (Also: A <em>concise</em> arrow function.) The one with <code>{ ... }</code> defining the body is an arrow function with a <em>function body</em>. (Also: A <em>verbose</em> arrow function.)</p>

<h3>Method Declaration in Object Initializer (ES2015+)</h3>

<p>ES2015 allows a shorter form of declaring a property that references a function called a <em>method definition</em>; it looks like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> o = {
    <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>the almost-equivalent in ES5 and earlier would be:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> o = {
    <span class="hljs-attr">foo</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>the difference (other than verbosity) is that a method can use <code>super</code>, but a function cannot. So for instance, if you had an object that defined (say) <code>valueOf</code> using method syntax, it could use <code>super.valueOf()</code> to get the value <code>Object.prototype.valueOf</code> would have returned (before presumably doing something else with it), whereas the ES5 version would have to do <code>Object.prototype.valueOf.call(this)</code> instead.</p>

<p>That also means that the method has a reference to the object it was defined on, so if that object is temporary (for instance, you're passing it into <code>Object.assign</code> as one of the source objects), method syntax <em>could</em> mean that the object is retained in memory when otherwise it could have been garbage collected (if the JavaScript engine doesn't detect that situation and handle it if none of the methods uses <code>super</code>).</p>

<h3>Constructor and Method Declarations in <code>class</code> (ES2015+)</h3>

<p>ES2015 brings us <code>class</code> syntax, including declared constructors and methods:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Person</span> {

<p>Speaking about the global context, both, the <code>var</code> statement and a <code>FunctionDeclaration</code> at the end will create a <em>non-deleteable</em> property on the global object, but the value of both <em>can be overwritten</em>.</p>

<p>The subtle difference between the two ways is that when the <a href="http://bclary.com/2004/11/07/#a-10.1.3" rel="noreferrer">Variable Instantiation</a> process runs (before the actual code execution) all identifiers declared with <code>var</code> will be initialized with <code>undefined</code>, and the ones used by the <code>FunctionDeclaration</code>'s will be available since that moment, for example:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"> <span class="hljs-title function_">alert</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span> foo); <span class="hljs-comment">// 'function', it's already available</span>
 <span class="hljs-title function_">alert</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span> bar); <span class="hljs-comment">// 'undefined'</span>
 <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span> () {}
 <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> bar = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {};
 <span class="hljs-title function_">alert</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span> bar); <span class="hljs-comment">// 'function'</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The assignment of the <code>bar</code> <code>FunctionExpression</code> takes place until runtime.</p>

<p>A global property created by a <code>FunctionDeclaration</code> can be overwritten without any problems just like a variable value, e.g.:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"> <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">test</span> () {}
 test = <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>Another obvious difference between your two examples is that the first function doesn't have a name, but the second has it, which can be really useful when debugging (i.e. inspecting a call stack).</p>

<p>About your edited first example (<code>foo = function() { alert('hello!'); };</code>), it is an undeclared assignment, I would highly encourage you to always use the <code>var</code> keyword.</p>

<p>With an assignment, without the <code>var</code> statement, if the referenced identifier is not found in the scope chain, it will become a <em>deleteable</em> property of the global object.</p>

<p>Also, undeclared assignments throw a <code>ReferenceError</code> on ECMAScript 5 under <a href="http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/es5-chapter-2-strict-mode/" rel="noreferrer">Strict Mode</a>.</p>

<p>The two code snippets you've posted there will, for almost all purposes, behave the same way.</p>

<p>However, the difference in behaviour is that with the first variant (<code>var functionOne = function() {}</code>), that function can only be called after that point in the code.</p>

<p>With the second variant (<code>function functionTwo()</code>), the function is available to code that runs above where the function is declared.</p>

<p>This is because with the first variant, the function is assigned to the variable <code>foo</code> at run time. In the second, the function is assigned to that identifier, <code>foo</code>, at parse time.</p>

<p><strong>More technical information</strong></p>

<p>JavaScript has three ways of defining functions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Your first snippet shows a <strong>function expression</strong>. This involves using the <em>"function" operator</em> to create a function - the result of that operator can be stored in any variable or object property. The function expression is powerful that way. The function expression is often called an "anonymous function", because it does not have to have a name,</li>
<li>Your second example is a <strong>function declaration</strong>. This uses the <em>"function" statement</em> to create a function. The function is made available at parse time and can be called anywhere in that scope. You can still store it in a variable or object property later.</li>
<li>The third way of defining a function is the <strong>"Function()" constructor</strong>, which is not shown in your original post. It's not recommended to use this as it works the same way as <code>eval()</code>, which has its problems.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Why no error? We were always taught that expressions are executed from top to bottom(??)</strong></p>
<h2>Because:</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Function declarations and variable declarations are always moved (<code>hoisted</code>) invisibly to the top of their containing scope by the JavaScript interpreter. Function parameters and language-defined names are, obviously, already there. <a href="http://www.adequatelygood.com/2010/2/JavaScript-Scoping-and-Hoisting" rel="noreferrer">ben cherry</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that code like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">functionOne</span>();                  ---------------      <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> functionOne;

<p>Notice that the assignment portion of the declarations were not hoisted. Only the name is hoisted.</p>

<p>Other commenters have already covered the semantic difference of the two variants above. I wanted to note a stylistic difference: Only the "assignment" variation can set a property of another object.</p>

<p>I often build JavaScript modules with a pattern like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">exports</span> = {};

    <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">privateUtil</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
            ...
    }

    <span class="hljs-built_in">exports</span>.<span class="hljs-property">publicUtil</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
            ...
    };

    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">exports</span>;
})();
</code></pre>

<p>With this pattern, your public functions will all use assignment, while your private functions use declaration.</p>

<p>(Note also that assignment should require a semicolon after the statement, while declaration prohibits it.)</p>

<p>In Google's V8 and Firefox's Spidermonkey there might be a few microsecond JIT compilation difference, but ultimately the result is the exact same. To prove this, let's examine the efficiency of JSPerf at micro-benchmarks by comparing the speed of two blank code snippets. The <a href="https://jsperf.com/microbenchmark-analysis/1" rel="noreferrer">JSPerf tests are found here</a>. And, the <a href="http://jsben.ch/Ov6eJ" rel="noreferrer">jsben.ch tests are  found here</a>. As you can see, there is a noticeable difference when there should be none. If you are really a performance freak like me, then it might be more worth your while trying to reduce the number of variables and functions in the scope and especially eliminating polymorphism (such as using the same variable to store two different types).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Variable Mutability</li>

<p>When you use the <code>var</code> keyword to declare a variable, you can then reassign a different value to the variable like so.</p>

<p>However, when we use the const-statement, the variable reference becomes immutable. This means that we cannot assign a new value to the variable. Please note, however, that this does not make the contents of the variable immutable: if you do <code>const arr = []</code>, then you can still do <code>arr[10] = "example"</code>. Only doing something like <code>arr = "new value"</code> or <code>arr = []</code> would throw an error as seen below.</p>

<p>The "nearest block" is the nearest "function," (including asynchronous functions, generator functions, and asynchronous generator functions). However, interestingly, a <code>function functionName() {}</code> behaves like a <code>var functionName = function() {}</code> when in a non-closure block to items outside said closure. Observe.</p>

<p>A function declaration and a function expression assigned to a variable behave the same once the binding is established.</p>

<p>There is a difference however at <em>how</em> and <em>when</em> the function object is actually associated with its variable. This difference is due to the mechanism called <em>variable hoisting</em> in JavaScript.</p>

<p>Basically, all function declarations and variable declarations are hoisted to the top of the <em>function</em> in which the declaration occurs (this is why we say that JavaScript has <em>function scope</em>).</p>

<ul>
<li><p>When a function declaration is hoisted, the function body "follows"
so when the function body is evaluated, the variable will immediately
be bound to a function object.</p></li>
<li><p>When a variable declaration is hoisted, the initialization does <em>not</em>
follow, but is "left behind". The variable is initialized to
<code>undefined</code> at the start of the function body, and will be <em>assigned</em>
a value at its original location in the code. (Actually, it will be assigned a value at <em>every</em> location where a declaration of a variable with the same name occurs.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The order of hoisting is also important: function declarations take precedence over variable declarations with the same name, and the last function declaration takes precedence over previous function declarations with the same name.</p>

<p>Some examples...</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> foo = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">bar</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {

  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> foo; }
<span class="hljs-title function_">bar</span>() <span class="hljs-comment">// 10</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Variable <code>foo</code> is hoisted to the top of the function, initialized to <code>undefined</code>, so that <code>!foo</code> is <code>true</code>, so <code>foo</code> is assigned <code>10</code>. The <code>foo</code> outside of <code>bar</code>'s scope plays no role and is untouched. </p>

<p>Function declarations take precedence over variable declarations, and the last function declaration "sticks".</p>

<p>In this example <code>a</code> is initialized with the function object resulting from evaluating the second function declaration, and then is assigned <code>4</code>.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;

<p>Here the function declaration is hoisted first, declaring and initializing variable <code>a</code>. Next, this variable is assigned <code>10</code>. In other words: the assignment does not assign to outer variable <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>The first example is a function declaration:</p>

<p>The second example is a function expression:</p>

<p>The main difference is how they are hoisted (lifted and declared). In the first example, the whole function declaration is hoisted. In the second example only the var 'abc' is hoisted, its value (the function) will be undefined, and the function itself remains at the position that it is declared.</p>

<p>To put it simply:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">//this will work</span>
<span class="hljs-title function_">abc</span>(param);

<p>In terms of code maintenance cost, named functions are more preferable:</p>

<ul>
<li>Independent from the place where they are declared (but still limited by scope).</li>
<li>More resistant to mistakes like conditional initialization (you are still able to override if wanted to).</li>
<li>The code becomes more readable by allocating local functions separately of scope functionality. Usually in the scope the functionality goes first, followed by declarations of local functions.</li>
<li>In a debugger you will clearly see the function name on the call stack instead of an "anonymous/evaluated" function.</li>
</ul>

<p>I suspect more PROS for named functions are follow. And what is listed as an advantage of named functions is a disadvantage for anonymous ones.</p>

<p>Historically, anonymous functions appeared from the inability of JavaScript as a language to list members with named functions:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">{
    <span class="hljs-attr">member</span>:<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) { <span class="hljs-comment">/* How do I make "this.member" a named function? */</span>

<p>In computer science terms, we talk about anonymous functions and named functions. I think the most important difference is that an anonymous function is not bound to a name, hence the name anonymous function. In JavaScript it is a first class object dynamically declared at runtime.</p>

<p>I use the variable approach in my code for a very specific reason, the theory of which has been covered in an abstract way above, but an example might help some people like me, with limited JavaScript expertise.</p>

<p>I have code that I need to run with 160 independently-designed brandings. Most of the code is in shared files, but branding-specific stuff is in a separate file, one for each branding.</p>

<p>Some brandings require specific functions, and some do not. Sometimes I have to add new functions to do new branding-specific things. I am happy to change the shared coded, but I don't want to have to change all 160 sets of branding files.</p>

<p>By using the variable syntax, I can declare the variable (a function pointer essentially) in the shared code and either assign a trivial stub function, or set to null.</p>

<p>The one or two brandings that need a specific implementation of the function can then define their version of the function and assign this to the variable if they want, and the rest do nothing. I can test for a null function before I execute it in the shared code.</p>

<p>From people's comments above, I gather it may be possible to redefine a static function too, but I think the variable solution is nice and clear.</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/336868/2730064">Greg's Answer</a> is good enough, but I still would like to add something to it that I learned just now watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford" rel="noreferrer">Douglas Crockford's</a> videos.</p>

<p><strong>Function expression:</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> foo = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {};
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Function statement:</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {};
</code></pre>

<p>The function statement is just a shorthand for <code>var</code> statement with a <code>function</code> value.</p>

<p>So</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {};
</code></pre>

<p>expands to</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> foo = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {};
</code></pre>

<p>Which expands further to:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> foo = <span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span>;
foo = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {};
</code></pre>

<p>And they are both hoisted to the top of the code.</p>

<p>I'm listing out the differences below:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A function declaration can be placed anywhere in the code. Even if it is invoked before the definition appears in code, it gets executed as function declaration is committed to memory or in a way it is hoisted up, before any other code in the page starts execution.</p>

<p>Take a look at the function below:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">outerFunction</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {

<p>A function expression, if not defined before calling it, will result in an error.

But the variable to which we assign the function gets hoisted up and <strong>undefined</strong> gets assigned to it.</p>

<p>Same function using function expressions:</p>

<p>In JavaScript there are two ways to create functions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Function declaration:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">fn</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello"</span>);
}
<span class="hljs-title function_">fn</span>();
</code></pre>

<p>This is very basic, self-explanatory, used in many languages and standard across C family of languages. We declared a function defined it and executed it by calling it.</p>

<p>What you should be knowing is that functions are actually objects in JavaScript; internally we have created an object for above function and given it a name called fn or the reference to the object is stored in fn. Functions are objects in JavaScript; an instance of function is actually an object instance.</p></li>
<li><p>Function expression:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> fn=<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello"</span>);
}
<span class="hljs-title function_">fn</span>();
</code></pre>

<p>JavaScript has first-class functions, that is, create a function and assign it to a variable just like you create a string or number and assign it to a variable. Here, the fn variable is assigned to a function. The reason for this concept is functions are objects in JavaScript; fn is pointing to the object instance of the above function. We have initialized a function and assigned it to a variable. It's not executing the function and assigning the result.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Reference: <em><a href="http://jkoder.com/javascript-function-declaration-syntax-var-fn-function-vs-function-fn/" rel="noreferrer">JavaScript function declaration syntax: var fn = function() {} vs function fn() {}</a></em></p>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution26" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl solution-inner border md:px-10 md:py-10 px-2 py-10 shadow-md bg-white"><div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-between"><h1 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 26</h1><div class="tags-wrap h-max space-x-8"><div class="tags"><a class="rounded-2xl border bg-neutral-100 px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold whitespace-nowrap" href="/questions/tag/idioms">idioms</a></div></div></div><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>In light of the "named functions show up in stack traces" argument, modern JavaScript engines are actually quite capable of representing anonymous functions.</p>

<p>As of this writing, V8, SpiderMonkey, Chakra and Nitro always refer to named functions by their names. They almost always refer to an anonymous function by its identifier if it has one.</p>

<p>SpiderMonkey can figure out the name of an anonymous function returned from another function. The rest can't.</p>

<p>If you really, really wanted your iterator and success callbacks to show up in the trace, you could name those too...</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">[].<span class="hljs-title function_">forEach</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">iterator</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {});
</code></pre>

<p>But for the most part it's not worth stressing over.</p>

<p>Both are different ways of defining a function. The difference is how the browser interprets and loads them into an execution context. </p>

<p>The first case is of function expressions which loads only when the interpreter reaches that line of code. So if you do it like the following, you will get an error that the <strong>functionOne is not a function</strong>.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">functionOne</span>();
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> functionOne = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Some code</span>
};
</code></pre>

<p>The reason is that on the first line no value is assigned to functionOne, and hence it is undefined. We are trying to call it as a function, and hence we are getting an error.</p>

<p>On the second line we are assigning the reference of an anonymous function to functionOne.</p>

<p>The second case is of function declarations that loads before any code is executed. So if you do like the following you won't get any error as the declaration loads before code execution.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">functionOne</span>();
<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">functionOne</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
   <span class="hljs-comment">// Some code</span>

<h1>Named Functions Vs. Anonymous Functions</h1>
<p>The first function syntax is <strong>Anonymous Function Expression</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> functionOne = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
  <span class="hljs-comment">// do something...</span>
};
</code></pre>
<p>While, the second one is <strong>Function Declaration</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">functionTwo</span> () {
  <span class="hljs-comment">// do something...</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>The main difference between both is the function name since <strong>Anonymous Functions</strong> have no name to call.
Anonymous functions are quick and easy to declare, and many libraries and tools tend to encourage this idiomatic style of code. However, anonymous functions have some <strong>drawbacks</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Readability:</strong> anonymous functions omit a name which could cause less readable code.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Debugging:</strong> anonymous functions have no name in stack traces, which can make debugging more difficult.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Self-Reference:</strong> what if the function needs to refer to itself, for recursion for example.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Naming Function Expression</h2>
<p>Providing a name for your function expression quite effectively addresses all these drawbacks, and has no tangible downsides. The best practice is to always name your function expressions:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-built_in">setTimeout</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">timeHandler</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) { <span class="hljs-comment">// &lt;-- look, a name here!</span>
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"I've waited 1 second"</span>);
}, <span class="hljs-number">1000</span>);
</code></pre>
<h2>Naming IIFEs (Immediate Invoked Function Expression)</h2>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">IIFE</span>(<span class="hljs-params">str</span>) { <span class="hljs-comment">// &lt;-- look, always name IIFEs!</span>
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(str); <span class="hljs-comment">// "Hello!"</span>
})(<span class="hljs-string">'Hello!'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>For functions assigned to a variable, naming the function, in this case, is not very common and may cause confusion, in this case, the arrow function may be a better choice.</p>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution29" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl solution-inner border md:px-10 md:py-10 px-2 py-10 shadow-md bg-white"><div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-between"><h1 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 29</h1><div class="tags-wrap h-max space-x-8"><div class="tags"><a class="rounded-2xl border bg-neutral-100 px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold whitespace-nowrap" href="/questions/tag/idioms">idioms</a></div></div></div><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>They are pretty similar with some small differences, first one is a variable which assigned to an anonymous function (Function Declaration) and second one is the normal way to create a function in JavaScript(Anonymous function Declaration), both has usage, cons and pros:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> functionOne = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Some code</span>
};
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Function Expression defines a function as a part of a larger
  expression syntax (typically a variable assignment ). Functions
  defined via Functions Expressions can be named or anonymous. Function
  Expressions must not start with function (hence the parentheses
  around the self invoking example below).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assign a variable to a function, means no Hoisting, as we know functions in JavaScript can Hoist, means they can be called before they get declared, while variables need to be declared before getting access to them, so means in this case we can not access the function before where it's declared, also it could be a way that you write your functions, for the functions which return another function, this kind of declaration could make sense, also in ECMA6 &amp; above you can assign this to an arrow function which can be used to call anonymous functions, also this way of declaring is a better way to create Constructor functions in JavaScript.</p>

<p><strong>2. Function Declaration</strong><br></p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">functionTwo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Some code</span>
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Function Declaration defines a named function variable without
  requiring variable assignment. Function Declarations occur as
  standalone constructs and cannot be nested within non-function blocks.
  Its helpful to think of them as siblings of Variable Declarations.
  Just as Variable Declarations must start with var, Function
  Declarations must begin with function.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the normal way of calling a function in JavaScript, this function can be called before you even declare it as in JavaScript all functions get Hoisted, but if you have 'use strict' this won't Hoist as expected, it's a good way to call all normal functions which are not big in lines and neither are a  constructor function.</p>

at run time. In the second, the function is assigned to that identifier, \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;foo\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, at parse time.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;More technical information\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;JavaScript has three ways of defining functions.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ol\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Your first snippet shows a \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;function expression\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;. This involves using the \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;\u0026quot;function\u0026quot; operator\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; to create a function - the result of that operator can be stored in any variable or object property. The function expression is powerful that way. The function expression is often called an \u0026quot;anonymous function\u0026quot;, because it does not have to have a name,\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Your second example is a \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;function declaration\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;. This uses the \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;\u0026quot;function\u0026quot; statement\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; to create a function. The function is made available at parse time and can be called anywhere in that scope. You can still store it in a variable or object property later.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;The third way of defining a function is the \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026quot;Function()\u0026quot; constructor\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;, which is not shown in your original post.

To prove this, let\u0026apos;s examine the efficiency of JSPerf at micro-benchmarks by comparing the speed of two blank code snippets. The \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://jsperf.com/microbenchmark-analysis/1\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;JSPerf tests are found here\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.

As you can see, there is a noticeable difference when there should be none. If you are really a performance freak like me, then it might be more worth your while trying to reduce the number of variables and functions in the scope and especially eliminating polymorphism (such as using the same variable to store two different types).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ol start=\u0026quot;4\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Variable Mutability\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ol\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When you use the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;var\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;

And what is listed as an advantage of named functions is a disadvantage for anonymous ones.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Historically, anonymous functions appeared from the inability of JavaScript as a language to list members with named functions:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-js s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-attr\u0026quot;\u0026gt;member\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;function\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-params\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;) { \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-comment\u0026quot;\u0026gt;/* How do I make \u0026quot;this.member\u0026quot; a named function? */\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n    }\n}\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In computer science terms, we talk about anonymous functions and named functions. I think the most important difference is that an anonymous function is not bound to a name, hence the name anonymous function. In JavaScript it is a first class object dynamically declared at runtime.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;For more information on anonymous functions and lambda calculus, Wikipedia is a good start: \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Anonymous Functions\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I use the variable approach in my code for a very specific reason, the theory of which has been covered in an abstract way above, but an example might help some people like me, with limited JavaScript expertise.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I have code that I need to run with 160 independently-designed brandings. Most of the code is in shared files, but branding-specific stuff is in a separate file, one for each branding.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Some brandings require specific functions, and some do not. Sometimes I have to add new functions to do new branding-specific things. I am happy to change the shared coded, but I don\u0026apos;t want to have to change all 160 sets of branding files.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;By using the variable syntax, I can declare the variable (a function pointer essentially) in the shared code and either assign a trivial stub function, or set to null.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The one or two brandings that need a specific implementation of the function can then define their version of the function and assign this to the variable if they want, and the rest do nothing. I can test for a null function before I execute it in the shared code.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;From people\u0026apos;s comments above, I gather it may be possible to redefine a static function too, but I think the variable solution is nice and clear.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/336868/2730064\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Greg\u0026apos;s Answer\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;
