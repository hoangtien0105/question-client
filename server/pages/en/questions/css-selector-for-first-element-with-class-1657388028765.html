Introduced in CSS2, the :first-child pseudo-class represents the very first child of its parent. That&apos;s it. There&apos;s a very common misconception that it picks up whichever child element is the first to match the conditions specified by the rest of the compound selector. Due to the way selectors work (see here for an explanation), that is simply not true.\nSelectors level 3 introduces a :first-of-type pseudo-class, which represents the first element among siblings of its element type. This answer explains, with illustrations, the difference between :first-child and :first-of-type. However, as with :first-child, it does not look at any other conditions or attributes. In HTML, the element type is represented by the tag name. In the question, that type is p.\nUnfortunately, there is no similar :first-of-class pseudo-class for matching the first child element of a given class. At the time this answer was first posted, the newly published FPWD of Selectors level 4 introduced an :nth-match() pseudo-class, designed around existing selector mechanics as I mentioned in the first paragraph by adding a selector-list argument, through which you can supply the rest of the compound selector to get the desired filtering behavior. In recent years this functionality was subsumed into :nth-child() itself, with the selector list appearing as an optional second argument, to simplify things as well as averting the false impression that :nth-match() matched across the entire document (see the final note below).\nWhile we await cross-browser support (seriously, it&apos;s been nearly 10 years, and there has only been a single implementation for the last 5 of those years), one workaround that Lea Verou and I developed independently (she did it first!) is to first apply your desired styles to all your elements with that class:\n/* \n * Select all .red children of .home, including the first one,\n * and give them a border.\n */\n.home &gt; .red {\n    border: 1px solid red;\n}\n\n... then &quot;undo&quot; the styles for elements with the class that come after the first one, using the general sibling combinator ~ in an overriding rule:\n/* \n * Select all but the first .red child of .home,\n * and remove the border from the previous rule.\n */\n.home &gt; .red ~ .red {\n    border: none;\n}\n\nNow only the first element with class=&quot;red&quot; will have a border.\nHere&apos;s an illustration of how the rules are applied:\n\n\n.home &gt; .red {\n    border: 1px solid red;\n}\n\n.home &gt; .red ~ .red {\n    border: none;\n}\n&lt;div class=&quot;home&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;span&gt;blah&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;!-- [1] --&gt;\n  &lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;first&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;!-- [2] --&gt;\n  &lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;second&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- [3] --&gt;\n  &lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;third&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;!-- [3] --&gt;\n  &lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;fourth&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- [3] --&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\nNo rules are applied; no border is rendered.\nThis element does not have the class red, so it&apos;s skipped.\n\nOnly the first rule is applied; a red border is rendered.\nThis element has the class red, but it&apos;s not preceded by any elements with the class red in its parent. Thus the second rule is not applied, only the first, and the element keeps its border.\n\nBoth rules are applied; no border is rendered.\nThis element has the class red. It is also preceded by at least one other element with the class red. Thus both rules are applied, and the second border declaration overrides the first, thereby &quot;undoing&quot; it, so to speak.\n\n\nAs a bonus, although it was introduced in Selectors 3, the general sibling combinator is actually pretty well-supported by IE7 and newer, unlike :first-of-type and :nth-of-type() which are only supported by IE9 onward. If you need good browser support, you&apos;re in luck.\nIn fact, the fact that the sibling combinator is the only important component in this technique, and it has such amazing browser support, makes this technique very versatile  you can adapt it for filtering elements by other things, besides class selectors:\n\nYou can use this to work around :first-of-type in IE7 and IE8, by simply supplying a type selector instead of a class selector (again, more on its incorrect usage in the question in a later section):\n  article &gt; p {\n     /* Apply styles to article &gt; p:first-of-type, which may or may not be :first-child */\n }\n\n article &gt; p ~ p {\n     /* Undo the above styles for every subsequent article &gt; p */\n }\n\n\nYou can filter by attribute selectors or any other simple selectors instead of classes.\n\nYou can also combine this overriding technique with pseudo-elements even though pseudo-elements technically aren&apos;t simple selectors.\n\n\nNote that in order for this to work, you will need to know in advance what the default styles will be for your other sibling elements so you can override the first rule. Additionally, since this involves overriding rules in CSS, you can&apos;t achieve the same thing with a single selector for use with the Selectors API, or Selenium&apos;s CSS locators.\nOn a final note, keep in mind that this answer assumes that the question is looking for any number of first child elements having a given class. There is neither a pseudo-class nor even a generic CSS solution for the nth match of a complex selector across the entire document  whether a solution exists depends heavily on the document structure. jQuery provides :eq(), :first, :last and more for this purpose, but note again that they function very differently from :nth-child() et al. Using the Selectors API, you can either use document.querySelector() to obtain the very first match:\nvar first = document.querySelector(&apos;.home &gt; .red&apos;);\n\nOr use document.querySelectorAll() with an indexer to pick any specific match:\nvar redElements = document.querySelectorAll(&apos;.home &gt; .red&apos;);\nvar first = redElements[0];\nvar second = redElements[1];\n// etc\n\n\nAlthough the .red:nth-of-type(1) solution in the original accepted answer by Philip Daubmeier works (which was originally written by Martyn but deleted since), it does not behave the way you&apos;d expect it to.\nFor example, if you only wanted to select the p here:\n&lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n... then you can&apos;t use .red:first-of-type (equivalent to .red:nth-of-type(1)), because each element is the first (and only) one of its type (p and div respectively), so both will be matched by the selector.\nWhen the first element of a certain class is also the first of its type, the pseudo-class will work, but this happens only by coincidence. This behavior is demonstrated in Philip&apos;s answer. The moment you stick in an element of the same type before this element, the selector will fail. Taking the markup from the question:\n&lt;div class=&quot;home&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;span&gt;blah&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;first&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;second&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;third&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;fourth&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nApplying a rule with .red:first-of-type will work, but once you add another p without the class:\n&lt;div class=&quot;home&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;span&gt;blah&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;dummy&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;first&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;second&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;third&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p class=&quot;red&quot;&gt;fourth&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n... the selector will immediately fail, because the first .red element is now the second p element.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"The :first-child selector is intended, like the name says, to select the first child of a parent tag.

<p>This is one of the most well-known examples of authors misunderstanding how <code>:first-child</code> works. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#first-child" rel="noreferrer">Introduced in CSS2</a>, the <code>:first-child</code> pseudo-class represents <strong>the very first child of its parent</strong>. That's it. There's a very common misconception that it picks up whichever child element is the first to match the conditions specified by the rest of the compound selector. Due to the way selectors work (see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5545649/can-i-combine-nth-child-or-nth-of-type-with-an-arbitrary-selector/5546296#5546296">here</a> for an explanation), that is simply not true.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#first-of-type-pseudo" rel="noreferrer">Selectors level 3 introduces a <code>:first-of-type</code> pseudo-class</a>, which represents the first element among siblings of its element type. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24657555/what-is-the-difference-between-first-child-and-first-of-type/24657721#24657721">This answer</a> explains, with illustrations, the difference between <code>:first-child</code> and <code>:first-of-type</code>. However, as with <code>:first-child</code>, it does not look at any other conditions or attributes. In HTML, the element type is represented by the tag name. In the question, that type is <code>p</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no similar <code>:first-of-class</code> pseudo-class for matching the first child element of a given class. At the time this answer was first posted, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-selectors4-20110929/#nth-match" rel="noreferrer">the newly published FPWD of Selectors level 4 introduced an <code>:nth-match()</code> pseudo-class</a>, designed around existing selector mechanics as I mentioned in the first paragraph by adding a selector-list argument, through which you can supply the rest of the compound selector to get the desired filtering behavior. In recent years this functionality was <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/#the-nth-child-pseudo" rel="noreferrer">subsumed into <code>:nth-child()</code> itself</a>, with the selector list appearing as an optional second argument, to simplify things as well as averting the false impression that <code>:nth-match()</code> matched across the entire document (see the final note below).</p>
<p>While we await <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-nth-child-of" rel="noreferrer">cross-browser support</a> (seriously, it's been nearly 10 years, and there has only been a single implementation for the last 5 of those years), one workaround that <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5287272/css-select-first-element-with-a-certain-class/5293095#5293095">Lea Verou</a> and I developed independently (she did it first!) is to first apply your desired styles to <em>all</em> your elements with that class:</p>

<span class="hljs-selector-class">.home</span> &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-class">.red</span> {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">border</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1px</span> solid red;
}
</code></pre>
<p>... then "undo" the styles for elements with the class that <em>come after the first one</em>, using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#general-sibling-combinators" rel="noreferrer">the general sibling combinator <code>~</code></a> in an overriding rule:</p>
<pre class="lang-css s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-comment">/* 
 * Select all but the first .red child of .home,
 * and remove the border from the previous rule.
 */</span>
<span class="hljs-selector-class">.home</span> &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-class">.red</span> ~ <span class="hljs-selector-class">.red</span> {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">border</span>: none;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now only the first element with <code>class="red"</code> will have a border.</p>
<p>Here's an illustration of how the rules are applied:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>No rules are applied; no border is rendered.</strong><br>
This element does not have the class <code>red</code>, so it's skipped.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Only the first rule is applied; a red border is rendered.</strong><br>
This element has the class <code>red</code>, but it's not preceded by any elements with the class <code>red</code> in its parent. Thus the second rule is not applied, only the first, and the element keeps its border.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Both rules are applied; no border is rendered.</strong><br>
This element has the class <code>red</code>. It is also preceded by at least one other element with the class <code>red</code>. Thus both rules are applied, and the second <code>border</code> declaration overrides the first, thereby "undoing" it, so to speak.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As a bonus, although it was introduced in Selectors 3, the general sibling combinator is actually pretty well-supported by IE7 and newer, unlike <code>:first-of-type</code> and <code>:nth-of-type()</code> which are only supported by IE9 onward. If you need good browser support, you're in luck.</p>
<p>In fact, the fact that the sibling combinator is the only important component in this technique, <em>and</em> it has such amazing browser support, makes this technique very versatile  you can adapt it for filtering elements by other things, besides class selectors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can use this to work around <code>:first-of-type</code> in IE7 and IE8, by simply supplying a type selector instead of a class selector (again, more on its incorrect usage in the question in a later section):</p>
 <pre class="lang-css s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"> <span class="hljs-selector-tag">article</span> &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag">p</span> {
     <span class="hljs-comment">/* Apply styles to article &gt; p:first-of-type, which may or may not be :first-child */</span>
 }

 <span class="hljs-selector-tag">article</span> &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag">p</span> ~ <span class="hljs-selector-tag">p</span> {
     <span class="hljs-comment">/* Undo the above styles for every subsequent article &gt; p */</span>
 }
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>You can filter by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7128406/css-select-the-first-child-from-elements-with-particular-attribute/7128429#7128429">attribute selectors</a> or any other simple selectors instead of classes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can also combine this overriding technique with <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8535686/first-child-not-working/8535800#8535800">pseudo-elements</a> even though pseudo-elements technically aren't simple selectors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in order for this to work, you will need to know in advance what the default styles will be for your other sibling elements so you can override the first rule. Additionally, since this involves overriding rules in CSS, you can't achieve the same thing with a single selector for use with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-api" rel="noreferrer">Selectors API</a>, or <a href="https://www.selenium.dev" rel="noreferrer">Selenium</a>'s CSS locators.</p>
<p>On a final note, keep in mind that this answer assumes that the question is looking for <em>any number of</em> first child elements having a given class. There is neither a pseudo-class nor even a generic CSS solution for the nth match of a complex selector <em>across the entire document</em>  whether a solution exists depends heavily on the document structure. jQuery provides <code>:eq()</code>, <code>:first</code>, <code>:last</code> and more for this purpose, but note again that <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9983297/difference-between-css-selector-and-jquery-filter/10835694#10835694">they function very differently from <code>:nth-child()</code> et al</a>. Using the Selectors API, you can either use <code>document.querySelector()</code> to obtain the very first match:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> first = <span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">querySelector</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'.home &gt; .red'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Or use <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code> with an indexer to pick any specific match:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> redElements = <span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">querySelectorAll</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'.home &gt; .red'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> first = redElements[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>];
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> second = redElements[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>];
<span class="hljs-comment">// etc</span>
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>Although the <code>.red:nth-of-type(1)</code> solution in the original accepted answer by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2717480/css-selector-for-first-element-with-class/2717515#2717515">Philip Daubmeier</a> works (which was originally written by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/264276/martyn">Martyn</a> but deleted since), it does not behave the way you'd expect it to.</p>
<p>For example, if you only wanted to select the <code>p</code> here:</p>
<pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">p</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"red"</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">p</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"red"</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>... then you can't use <code>.red:first-of-type</code> (equivalent to <code>.red:nth-of-type(1)</code>), because each element is the first (and only) one of its type (<code>p</code> and <code>div</code> respectively), so <em>both</em> will be matched by the selector.</p>
<p>When the first element of a certain class <em>is also the first of its type</em>, the pseudo-class will work, but <strong>this happens only by coincidence</strong>. This behavior is demonstrated in Philip's answer. The moment you stick in an element of the same type before this element, the selector will fail. Taking the markup from the question:</p>
<pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"home"</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">span</span>&gt;</span>blah<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">span</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">p</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"red"</span>&gt;</span>first<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">p</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">p</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"red"</span>&gt;</span>second<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">p</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">p</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"red"</span>&gt;</span>third<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">p</span>&gt;</span>

<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Applying a rule with <code>.red:first-of-type</code> will work, but once you add another <code>p</code> without the class:</p>
<pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"home"</span>&gt;</span>

<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>... the selector will immediately fail, because the first <code>.red</code> element is now the <em>second</em> <code>p</code> element.</p>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution2" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl solution-inner border md:px-10 md:py-10 px-2 py-10 shadow-md bg-white"><div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-between"><h4 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 2</h4><div class="tags-wrap h-max space-x-8"><div class="tags"></div></div></div><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>The <code>:first-child</code> selector is intended, like the name says, to select the first child of a parent tag. So this example will work (Just tried it <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_first-child1" rel="noreferrer">here</a>):</p>

<p>This won't work, though, if you've nested your tags under different parent tags, or if your tags of class <code>red</code> aren't the first tags under the parent.</p>
<p>Notice also that this doesn't only apply to the first such tag in the whole document, but every time a new parent is wrapped around it, like:</p>
<pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>

<p><code>first</code> and <code>third</code> will be red then.</p>

More infos for example <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/nthchild.html" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.

<p>Part I: If element is first to its parent and has class "red", it shall get border.<br>
Part II: If ".red" element is not first to its parent, but is immediately following an element without class ".red", it shall also deserve the honor of said border.</p>

<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Vq8PB/7/" rel="noreferrer">Fiddle or it didn't happen.</a></p>

<p>Philip Daubmeier's answer, while accepted, is not correct - see attached fiddle.<br>
BoltClock's answer would work, but unnecessarily defines and overwrites styles<br>
(particularly an issue where it otherwise would inherit a different border - you don't want to declare other to border:none)</p>

<p>EDIT:
In the event that you have "red" following non-red several times, each "first" red will get the border. To prevent that, one would need to use BoltClock's answer. See <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Vq8PB/8/" rel="noreferrer">fiddle</a></p>

<p>Since the other answers cover what's <em>wrong</em> with it, I'll try the other half, how to fix it.  Unfortunately, I don't know that you have a <strong>CSS only</strong> solution here, at least <em>not that I can think of</em>.  There are some other options though....</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Assign a <code>first</code> class to the element when you generate it, like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">p</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"red first"</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">p</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"red"</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>CSS:</p>

<pre class="lang-css s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.first</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.red</span> {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">border</span>:<span class="hljs-number">5px</span> solid red;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This CSS only matches elements with <strong>both</strong> <code>first</code> and <code>red</code> classes.  </p></li>
<li><p>Alternatively, do the same in JavaScript, for example here's what jQuery you would use to do this, using the same CSS as above:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$(<span class="hljs-string">".red:first"</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">addClass</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"first"</span>);
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>To match your selector, the element must have a class name of <code>red</code> and must be the first child of its parent.</p>

<p>This will select <strong>class home</strong>, then the element <strong>span</strong> and finally all <strong>.red elements</strong> that are placed immediately after span elements.  </p>

<p>I believe that using relative selector <code>+</code> for selecting elements placed immediately after, works here the best (as few suggested before).</p>

<p>It is also possible for this case to use this selector</p>

That\u0026apos;s it. There\u0026apos;s a very common misconception that it picks up whichever child element is the first to match the conditions specified by the rest of the compound selector. Due to the way selectors work (see \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5545649/can-i-combine-nth-child-or-nth-of-type-with-an-arbitrary-selector/5546296#5546296\u0026quot;\u0026gt;here\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; for an explanation), that is simply not true.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#first-of-type-pseudo\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Selectors level 3 introduces a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;:first-of-type\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; pseudo-class\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, which represents the first element among siblings of its element type. \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24657555/what-is-the-difference-between-first-child-and-first-of-type/24657721#24657721\u0026quot;\u0026gt;This answer\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; explains, with illustrations, the difference between \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;:first-child\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;:first-of-type\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. However, as with \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;:first-child\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, it does not look at any other conditions or attributes. In HTML, the element type is represented by the tag name. In the question, that type is \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;p\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Unfortunately, there is no similar \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;:first-of-class\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; pseudo-class for matching the first child element of a given class. At the time this answer was first posted, \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-selectors4-20110929/#nth-match\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;the newly published FPWD of Selectors level 4 introduced an \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;:nth-match()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; pseudo-class\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, designed around existing selector mechanics as I mentioned in the first paragraph by adding a selector-list argument, through which you can supply the rest of the compound selector to get the desired filtering behavior. In recent years this functionality was \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/#the-nth-child-pseudo\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;subsumed into \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;:nth-child()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; itself\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, with the selector list appearing as an optional second argument, to simplify things as well as averting the false impression that \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;:nth-match()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; matched across the entire document (see the final note below).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;While we await \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://caniuse.com/css-nth-child-of\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;cross-browser support\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; (seriously, it\u0026apos;s been nearly 10 years, and there has only been a single implementation for the last 5 of those years), one workaround that \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5287272/css-select-first-element-with-a-certain-class/5293095#5293095\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Lea Verou\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;
