Please consider switching to Android Gradle plugin 4.0, java.time.*, and its core library desugaring feature in the coming months.\nTo enable support for these language APIs on any version of the Android platform, update the Android plugin to 4.0.0 (or higher) and include the following in your modules build.gradle file:\nandroid {\n  defaultConfig {\n    // Required when setting minSdkVersion to 20 or lower\n    multiDexEnabled true\n  }\n\n  compileOptions {\n    // Flag to enable support for the new language APIs\n    coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true\n    // Sets Java compatibility to Java 8\n    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8\n    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8\n  }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n  coreLibraryDesugaring &apos;com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:1.0.5&apos;\n}\n\n\nOriginal Answer\nFirst Discovery: Why You Have To Use ThreeTenABP Instead of java.time, ThreeTen-Backport, or even Joda-Time\nThis is a really short version of the VERY LONG PROCESS of defining a new standard. All of these packages are pretty much the same thing: libraries that provide good, modern time handling functionality for Java. The differences are subtle but important.\nThe most obvious solution would be to use the built-in java.time package, since this is the new standard way to deal with time and dates in Java. It is an implementation of JSR 310, which was a new standard proposal for time handling based on the Joda-Time library.\nHowever, java.time was introduced in Java 8. Android up to Marshmallow runs on Java 7 (&quot;Android N&quot; is the first version to introduce Java 8 language features). Thus, unless you&apos;re only targeting Android N Nougat and above, you can&apos;t rely on Java 8 language features (I&apos;m not actually sure this is 100% true, but this is how I understand it). So java.time is out.\nThe next option might be Joda-Time, since JSR 310 was based on Joda-Time. However, as the ThreeTenABP readme indicates, for a number of reasons, Joda-Time is not the best option.\nNext is ThreeTen-Backport, which back-ports much (but not all) of the Java 8 java.time functionality to Java 7. This is fine for most use cases, but, as indicated in the ThreeTenABP readme, it has performance issues with Android.\nSo the last and seemingly correct option is ThreeTenABP.\nSecond Discovery: Build Tools and Dependency Management\nSince compiling a program -- especially one using a bunch of external libraries -- is complex, Java almost invariably uses a &quot;build tool&quot; to manage the process. Make, Apache Ant, Apache Maven, and Gradle are all build tools that are used with Java programs (see this post for comparisons). As noted further down, Gradle is the chosen build tool for Android projects.\nThese build tools include dependency management. Apache Maven appears to be the first to include a centralized package repository. Maven introduced the Maven Central Repository, which allows functionality equivalent to php&apos;s composer with Packagist and Ruby&apos;s gem with rubygems.org. In other words, the Maven Central Repository is to Maven (and Gradle) what Packagist is to composer -- a definitive and secure source for versioned packages.\nThird Discovery: Gradle Handles Dependencies in Android Projects\nHigh on my to-do list is to read the Gradle docs here, including their free eBooks. Had I read these weeks ago when I started learning Android, I would surely have known that Gradle can use the Maven Central Repository to manage dependencies in Android Projects. Furthermore, as detailed in this StackOverflow answer, as of Android Studio 0.8.9, Gradle uses Maven Central Repository implicitly through Bintray&apos;s JCenter, which means you don&apos;t have to do any extra config to set up the repo -- you just list the dependencies.\nFourth Discovery: Project Dependencies Are Listed in [project dir]/app/build.gradle\nAgain, obvious to those who have any experience using Gradle in Java, but it took me a while to figure this out. If you see people saying &quot;Oh, just add compile &apos;this-or-that.jar&apos;&quot; or something similar, know that compile is a directive in that build.gradle file that indicates compile-time dependencies. Here&apos;s the official Gradle page on dependency management.\nFifth Discovery: ThreeTenABP Is Managed by Jake Wharton, not by ThreeTen\nYet another issue I spent too much time figuring out. If you look for ThreeTen in Maven Central, you&apos;ll only see packages for threetenbp, not threetenabp. If you go to the github repo for ThreeTenABP, you&apos;ll see that infamous compile &apos;this-or-that&apos; line under the Download section of the Readme.\nWhen I first hit this github repo, I didn&apos;t know what that compile line meant, and I tried to run it in my terminal (with an obvious and predictable failure). Frustrated, I didn&apos;t return to it until long after I figured the rest out, and finally realized that it&apos;s a Maven Repo line pointing to the com.jakewharton.threetenabp repo, as opposed to the org.threeten repo. That&apos;s why I thought the ThreeTenABP package wasn&apos;t in the Maven repo.\nSummary: Making it work\nNow it all seems pretty easy. You can get modern time handling functions in an Android project by making sure your [project folder]/app/build.gradle file has the implementation &apos;com.jakewharton.threetenabp:threetenabp:1.2.1&apos; line in its dependencies section:\napply plugin: &apos;com.android.application&apos;\n\nandroid {\n    compileSdkVersion 23\n    buildToolsVersion &quot;23.0.3&quot;\n\n    defaultConfig {\n        applicationId &quot;me.ahuman.myapp&quot;\n        minSdkVersion 11\n        targetSdkVersion 23\n        versionCode 1\n        versionName &quot;1.0&quot;\n    }\n    buildTypes {\n        release {\n            minifyEnabled false\n            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile(&apos;proguard-android.txt&apos;), &apos;proguard-rules.pro&apos;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation fileTree(dir: &apos;libs&apos;, include: [&apos;*.jar&apos;])\n    testImplementation &apos;junit:junit:4.12&apos;\n    implementation &apos;com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.4.0&apos;\n    implementation &apos;com.android.support:design:23.4.0&apos;\n    implementation &apos;com.jakewharton.threetenabp:threetenabp:1.2.1&apos;\n}\n\nAlso add this to Application class:\npublic class App extends Application {    \n    @Override\n    public void onCreate() {\n        super.onCreate();\n        AndroidThreeTen.init(this);\n        //...\n    }\n}\n\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/how-to-use-threetenabp-in-android-project-1657384345704#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"The accepted Answer by kael is correct. In addition, I will mention a couple things, and provide a diagram about obtaining java.time functionality.\njava.time built into Android 26+\nIf targeting Android 26 or later, you will find an implementation of JSR 310 (java.time classes) bundled with Android. No need to add ThreeTenABP.\nAPIs nearly identical\nJust to clarify, ThreeTenABP for Android is an adaptation of the ThreeTen-Backport library that brings most of the java.time functionality to Java 6 and Java 7. This back-port shares nearly an identical API with java.time.\nSuppose you are now targeting Android earlier than 26, so you use ThreeTenABP. Later, your may eventually drop support for these earlier versions of Android, to use the java.time classes bundled with Android. When that happens, you need make few changes to your codebase other than (a) switching import statements, and (b) changing any calls you made to org.threeten.bp.DateTimeUtils to use the new conversion methods that were added to the old legacy date-time classes (Date, GregorianCalendar).\nThe transition process from ThreeTenABP to java.time should be smooth and nearly painless.\nWhen to use which framework\nHere is a chart showing the three frameworks, and indicating when to use which one in which scenarios.\n Update: Android Gradle Plugin 4.0.0+ brings a new 4th option, API desugaring to make available a subset of java.time functionality not originally built into earlier Android. See the top of the main Answer by kael.\n\n\nAbout java.time\nThe java.time framework is built into Java 8 and later. These classes supplant the troublesome old legacy date-time classes such as java.util.Date, Calendar, &amp; SimpleDateFormat.\nTo learn more, see the Oracle Tutorial. And search Stack Overflow for many examples and explanations. Specification is JSR 310.\nThe Joda-Time project, now in maintenance mode, advises migration to the java.time classes.\nYou may exchange java.time objects directly with your database. Use a JDBC driver compliant with JDBC 4.2 or later. No need for strings, no need for java.sql.* classes. Hibernate 5 &amp; JPA 2.2 support java.time.\nWhere to obtain the java.time classes?\n\nJava SE 8, Java SE 9, Java SE 10, Java SE 11, and later  - Part of the standard Java API with a bundled implementation.\n\nJava 9 brought some minor features and fixes.\n\n\nJava SE 6 and Java SE 7\n\nMost of the java.time functionality is back-ported to Java 6 &amp; 7 in ThreeTen-Backport.\n\n\nAndroid\n\nLater versions of Android (26+) bundle implementations of the java.time classes.\nFor earlier Android (&lt;26), the process of API desugaring brings a subset of the java.time functionality not originally built into Android.\n\nIf the desugaring does not offer what you need, the ThreeTenABP project adapts ThreeTen-Backport (mentioned above) to Android.

<h1>Original Answer</h1>
<h2>First Discovery: Why You Have To Use <em>ThreeTenABP</em> Instead of <em>java.time</em>, <em>ThreeTen-Backport</em>, or even <em>Joda-Time</em></h2>
<p>This is a really short version of the VERY LONG PROCESS of defining a new standard. All of these packages are pretty much the same thing: libraries that provide good, modern time handling functionality for Java. The differences are subtle but important.</p>
<p>The most obvious solution would be to use the built-in <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>java.time</code></a> package, since this is the new standard way to deal with time and dates in Java. It is an implementation of <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310" rel="noreferrer">JSR 310</a>, which was a new standard proposal for time handling based on the <a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/" rel="noreferrer">Joda-Time</a> library.</p>
<p>However, <code>java.time</code> was introduced in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_8" rel="noreferrer">Java 8</a>. Android up to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Marshmallow" rel="noreferrer">Marshmallow</a> runs on Java 7 ("Android N" is the first version to introduce Java 8 language features). Thus, unless you're only targeting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Nougat" rel="noreferrer">Android N <em>Nougat</em></a> and above, you can't rely on Java 8 language features (I'm not actually sure this is 100% true, but this is how I understand it). So <code>java.time</code> is out.</p>
<p>The next option might be <a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/" rel="noreferrer"><em>Joda-Time</em></a>, since <a href="https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310" rel="noreferrer">JSR 310</a> was based on Joda-Time. However, as the <a href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP#why-not-use-threetenbp" rel="noreferrer">ThreeTenABP readme</a> indicates, for a number of reasons, Joda-Time is not the best option.</p>
<p>Next is <a href="http://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/" rel="noreferrer"><em>ThreeTen-Backport</em></a>, which back-ports much (but not all) of the Java 8 <code>java.time</code> functionality to Java 7. This is fine for most use cases, but, as indicated in the <a href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP#why-not-use-threetenbp" rel="noreferrer">ThreeTenABP readme</a>, it has performance issues with Android.</p>
<p>So the last and seemingly correct option is <a href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP" rel="noreferrer"><em>ThreeTenABP</em></a>.</p>
<h2>Second Discovery: Build Tools and Dependency Management</h2>
<p>Since compiling a program -- especially one using a bunch of external libraries -- is complex, Java almost invariably uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation" rel="noreferrer">"build tool"</a> to manage the process. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)" rel="noreferrer"><em>Make</em></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Ant" rel="noreferrer"><em>Apache Ant</em></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven" rel="noreferrer"><em>Apache Maven</em></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradle" rel="noreferrer"><em>Gradle</em></a> are all build tools that are used with Java programs (see <a href="https://technologyconversations.com/2014/06/18/build-tools/" rel="noreferrer">this post</a> for comparisons). As noted further down, Gradle is the chosen build tool for Android projects.</p>
<p>These build tools include dependency management. Apache Maven appears to be the first to include a centralized package repository. Maven introduced the <a href="https://search.maven.org/" rel="noreferrer">Maven Central Repository</a>, which allows functionality equivalent to php's <code>composer</code> with Packagist and Ruby's <code>gem</code> with rubygems.org. In other words, the Maven Central Repository is to Maven (and Gradle) what Packagist is to composer -- a definitive and secure source for versioned packages.</p>
<h2>Third Discovery: Gradle Handles Dependencies in Android Projects</h2>
<p>High on my to-do list is to read the Gradle docs <a href="https://gradle.org/getting-started-gradle/" rel="noreferrer">here</a>, including their free eBooks. Had I read these weeks ago when I started learning Android, I would surely have known that Gradle can use the Maven Central Repository to manage dependencies in Android Projects. Furthermore, as detailed in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/26630422/2065427">this</a> StackOverflow answer, as of Android Studio 0.8.9, Gradle uses Maven Central Repository implicitly through Bintray's JCenter, which means you don't have to do any extra config to set up the repo -- you just list the dependencies.</p>
<h2>Fourth Discovery: Project Dependencies Are Listed in [project dir]/app/build.gradle</h2>
<p>Again, obvious to those who have any experience using Gradle in Java, but it took me a while to figure this out. If you see people saying "Oh, just add <code>compile 'this-or-that.jar'</code>" or something similar, know that <code>compile</code> is a directive in that build.gradle file that indicates compile-time dependencies. <a href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/artifact_dependencies_tutorial.html" rel="noreferrer">Here's</a> the official Gradle page on dependency management.</p>
<h2>Fifth Discovery: ThreeTenABP Is Managed by Jake Wharton, not by ThreeTen</h2>
<p>Yet another issue I spent too much time figuring out. If you look for ThreeTen in Maven Central, you'll only see packages for <code>threetenbp</code>, not <code>threetenabp</code>. If you go to the <a href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP" rel="noreferrer">github repo for ThreeTenABP</a>, you'll see that infamous <code>compile 'this-or-that'</code> line under the Download section of the Readme.</p>
<p>When I first hit this github repo, I didn't know what that compile line meant, and I tried to run it in my terminal (with an obvious and predictable failure). Frustrated, I didn't return to it until long after I figured the rest out, and finally realized that it's a Maven Repo line pointing to the <code>com.jakewharton.threetenabp</code> repo, as opposed to the <code>org.threeten</code> repo. That's why I thought the ThreeTenABP package wasn't in the Maven repo.</p>
<h2>Summary: Making it work</h2>
<p>Now it all seems pretty easy. You can get modern time handling functions in an Android project by making sure your <code>[project folder]/app/build.gradle</code> file has the <code>implementation 'com.jakewharton.threetenabp:threetenabp:1.2.1'</code> line in its <code>dependencies</code> section:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">apply plugin: <span class="hljs-string">'com.android.application'</span>

        }
    }
}

<p>The accepted <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/38922755/642706">Answer by kael</a> is correct. In addition, I will mention a couple things, and provide a diagram about obtaining <em>java.time</em> functionality.</p>
<h1><em>java.time</em> built into Android 26+</h1>
<p>If targeting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history#Android_8.0_Oreo_(API_26)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Android 26</a> or later, you will find an implementation of <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JSR 310</a> (<em>java.time</em> classes) bundled with Android. No need to add <em>ThreeTenABP</em>.</p>
<h1>APIs nearly identical</h1>
<p>Just to clarify, <a href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>ThreeTenABP</em></a> for Android is an adaptation of the <a href="https://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>ThreeTen-Backport</em></a> library that brings most of the <em>java.time</em> functionality to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_6" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Java 6</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_7" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Java 7</a>. This back-port shares nearly an identical API with <em>java.time</em>.</p>
<p>Suppose you are now targeting Android earlier than 26, so you use <em>ThreeTenABP</em>. Later, your may eventually drop support for these earlier versions of Android, to use the <em>java.time</em> classes bundled with Android. When that happens, you need make few changes to your codebase other than (a) switching <code>import</code> statements, and (b) changing any calls you made to <a href="https://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/apidocs/org/threeten/bp/DateTimeUtils.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>org.threeten.bp.DateTimeUtils</code></a> to use the new conversion methods that were added to the old legacy date-time classes (<code>Date</code>, <code>GregorianCalendar</code>).</p>
<p>The transition process from <em>ThreeTenABP</em> to <em>java.time</em> should be smooth and nearly painless.</p>
<h1>When to use which framework</h1>
<p>Here is a chart showing the three frameworks, and indicating when to use which one in which scenarios.</p>
<p><strong> Update:</strong> Android Gradle Plugin 4.0.0+ brings a new 4th option, <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring" rel="nofollow noreferrer">API desugaring</a> to make available a <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support-table" rel="nofollow noreferrer">subset of <em>java.time</em> functionality</a> not originally built into earlier Android. See the top of the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/38922755/642706">main Answer</a> by kael.</p>

<h1>About <em>java.time</em></h1>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/package-summary.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>java.time</em></a> framework is built into Java 8 and later. These classes supplant the troublesome old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system" rel="nofollow noreferrer">legacy</a> date-time classes such as <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Date.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>java.util.Date</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Calendar.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Calendar</code></a>, &amp; <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>SimpleDateFormat</code></a>.</p>
<p>To learn more, see the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/TOC.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>Oracle Tutorial</em></a>. And search Stack Overflow for many examples and explanations. Specification is <a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JSR 310</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.joda.org/joda-time/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>Joda-Time</em></a> project, now in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance_mode" rel="nofollow noreferrer">maintenance mode</a>, advises migration to the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/package-summary.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">java.time</a> classes.</p>
<p>You may exchange <em>java.time</em> objects directly with your database. Use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDBC_driver" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JDBC driver</a> compliant with <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/170" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JDBC 4.2</a> or later. No need for strings, no need for <code>java.sql.*</code> classes. Hibernate 5 &amp; JPA 2.2 support <em>java.time</em>.</p>

All of these packages are pretty much the same thing: libraries that provide good, modern time handling functionality for Java. The differences are subtle but important.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The most obvious solution would be to use the built-in \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;java.time\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; package, since this is the new standard way to deal with time and dates in Java. It is an implementation of \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;JSR 310\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, which was a new standard proposal for time handling based on the \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://www.joda.org/joda-time/\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Joda-Time\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; library.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;However, \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;java.time\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; was introduced in \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history#Java_SE_8\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Java 8\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;. Android up to \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Marshmallow\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Marshmallow\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; runs on Java 7 (\u0026quot;Android N\u0026quot; is the first version to introduce Java 8 language features). Thus, unless you\u0026apos;re only targeting \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Nougat\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Android N \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;Nougat\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; and above, you can\u0026apos;t rely on Java 8 language features (I\u0026apos;m not actually sure this is 100% true, but this is how I understand it). So \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;java.time\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is out.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The next option might be \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://www.joda.org/joda-time/\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;Joda-Time\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, since \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=310\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;JSR 310\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; was based on Joda-Time. However, as the \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP#why-not-use-threetenbp\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;ThreeTenABP readme\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; indicates, for a number of reasons, Joda-Time is not the best option.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Next is \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;ThreeTen-Backport\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, which back-ports much (but not all) of the Java 8 \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;java.time\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; functionality to Java 7. This is fine for most use cases, but, as indicated in the \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP#why-not-use-threetenbp\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;ThreeTenABP readme\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, it has performance issues with Android.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So the last and seemingly correct option is \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;ThreeTenABP\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Second Discovery: Build Tools and Dependency Management\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Since compiling a program -- especially one using a bunch of external libraries -- is complex, Java almost invariably uses a \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_automation\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;build tool\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; to manage the process. \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;Make\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Ant\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;Apache Ant\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Maven\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;Apache Maven\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, and \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradle\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;Gradle\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; are all build tools that are used with Java programs (see \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://technologyconversations.com/2014/06/18/build-tools/\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;this post\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; for comparisons). As noted further down, Gradle is the chosen build tool for Android projects.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;These build tools include dependency management. Apache Maven appears to be the first to include a centralized package repository. Maven introduced the \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://search.maven.org/\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Maven Central Repository\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, which allows functionality equivalent to php\u0026apos;s \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;composer\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; with Packagist and Ruby\u0026apos;s \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;gem\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; with rubygems.org. In other words, the Maven Central Repository is to Maven (and Gradle) what Packagist is to composer -- a definitive and secure source for versioned packages.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Third Discovery: Gradle Handles Dependencies in Android Projects\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;High on my to-do list is to read the Gradle docs \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://gradle.org/getting-started-gradle/\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;here\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, including their free eBooks. Had I read these weeks ago when I started learning Android, I would surely have known that Gradle can use the Maven Central Repository to manage dependencies in Android Projects. Furthermore, as detailed in \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/26630422/2065427\u0026quot;\u0026gt;this\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; StackOverflow answer, as of Android Studio 0.8.9, Gradle uses Maven Central Repository implicitly through Bintray\u0026apos;s JCenter, which means you don\u0026apos;t have to do any extra config to set up the repo -- you just list the dependencies.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Fourth Discovery: Project Dependencies Are Listed in [project dir]/app/build.gradle\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Again, obvious to those who have any experience using Gradle in Java, but it took me a while to figure this out. If you see people saying \u0026quot;Oh, just add \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;compile \u0026apos;this-or-that.jar\u0026apos;\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026quot; or something similar, know that \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;compile\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is a directive in that build.gradle file that indicates compile-time dependencies. \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/artifact_dependencies_tutorial.html\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Here\u0026apos;s\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; the official Gradle page on dependency management.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Fifth Discovery: ThreeTenABP Is Managed by Jake Wharton, not by ThreeTen\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Yet another issue I spent too much time figuring out. If you look for ThreeTen in Maven Central, you\u0026apos;ll only see packages for \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;threetenbp\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, not \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;threetenabp\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. If you go to the \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;github repo for ThreeTenABP\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, you\u0026apos;ll see that infamous \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;compile \u0026apos;this-or-that\u0026apos;\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; line under the Download section of the Readme.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When I first hit this github repo, I didn\u0026apos;t know what that compile line meant, and I tried to run it in my terminal (with an obvious and predictable failure).
