I expect it to output 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. However, it actually outputs five 10s.

It seems that it is due to all actions referring to one captured variable. As a result, when they get invoked, they all have same output.

Is there a way to work round this limit to have each action instance have its own captured variable?

Passing variables to these methods involve some dilemmas (pass by value? pass by reference? C# goes with by reference - but this opens another problem where the reference can outlive the actual variable). What C# does to resolve all these dilemmas is to create a new helper class (&quot;closure&quot;) with fields corresponding to the local variables used in the lambda expressions, and methods corresponding to the actual lambda methods. Any changes to variable in your code is actually translated to change in that ClosureClass.variable\n\nSo your while loop keeps updating the ClosureClass.variable until it reaches 10, then you for loops executes the actions, which all operate on the same ClosureClass.variable.\n\nTo get your expected result, you need to create a separation between the loop variable, and the variable that is being closured. You can do this by introducing another variable, i.e.:\n\nList&lt;Func&lt;int&gt;&gt; actions = new List&lt;Func&lt;int&gt;&gt;();\nint variable = 0;\nwhile (variable &lt; 5)\n{\n    var t = variable; // now t will be closured (i.e. replaced by a field in the new class)\n    actions.Add(() =&gt; t * 2);\n    ++variable; // changing variable won&apos;t affect the closured variable t\n}\nforeach (var act in actions)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(act.Invoke());\n}\n\n\nYou could also move the closure to another method to create this separation:\n\nList&lt;Func&lt;int&gt;&gt; actions = new List&lt;Func&lt;int&gt;&gt;();\n\nint variable = 0;\nwhile (variable &lt; 5)\n{\n    actions.Add(Mult(variable));\n    ++variable;\n}\n\nforeach (var act in actions)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(act.Invoke());\n}\n\n\nYou can implement Mult as a lambda expression (implicit closure) \n\nstatic Func&lt;int&gt; Mult(int i)\n{\n    return () =&gt; i * 2;\n}\n\n\nor with an actual helper class:\n\npublic class Helper\n{\n    public int _i;\n    public Helper(int i)\n    {\n        _i = i;\n    }\n    public int Method()\n    {\n        return _i * 2;\n    }\n}\n\nstatic Func&lt;int&gt; Mult(int i)\n{\n    Helper help = new Helper(i);\n    return help.Method;\n}\n\n\nIn any case, &quot;Closures&quot; are NOT a concept related to loops, but rather to anonymous methods / lambda expressions use of local scoped variables - although some incautious use of loops demonstrate closures traps.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Yes you need to scope variable within the loop and pass it to the lambda that way:\n\nList&lt;Func&lt;int&gt;&gt; actions = new List&lt;Func&lt;int&gt;&gt;();\n\nint variable = 0;\nwhile (variable &lt; 5)\n{\n    int variable1 = variable;\n    actions.Add(() =&gt; variable1 * 2);\n    ++variable;\n}\n\nforeach (var act in actions)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(act.Invoke());\n}\n\nConsole.ReadLine();\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution6","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"The same situation is happening in multi-threading (C#, .NET 4.0].\n\nSee the following code:\n\nPurpose is to print 1,2,3,4,5 in order.\n\nfor (int counter = 1; counter &lt;= 5; counter++)\n{\n    new Thread (() =&gt; Console.Write (counter)).Start();\n}\n\n\nThe output is interesting!

However, when an anonymous function captures a local variable, the effects of instantiation become apparent.\n  \n  [Example: The example \n\n\nusing System;\n\ndelegate void D();\n\nclass Test{\n  static D[] F() {\n    D[] result = new D[3];\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n      int x = i * 2 + 1;\n      result[i] = () =&gt; { Console.WriteLine(x); };\n    }\n  return result;\n  }\n  static void Main() {\n    foreach (D d in F()) d();\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n  produces the output:\n\n\n1\n3\n5\n\n\n\n  However, when the declaration of x is moved outside the loop:\n\n\nstatic D[] F() {\n  D[] result = new D[3];\n  int x;\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n    x = i * 2 + 1;\n    result[i] = () =&gt; { Console.WriteLine(x); };\n  }\n  return result;\n}\n\n\n\n  the output is:\n\n\n5\n5\n5\n\n\n\n  Note that the compiler is permitted (but not required) to optimize the three instantiations into a single delegate instance (§11.7.2).\n  \n  If a for-loop declares an iteration variable, that variable itself is considered to be declared outside of the loop. \n  [Example: Thus, if the example is changed to capture the iteration variable itself:\n\n\nstatic D[] F() {\n  D[] result = new D[3];\n  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n    result[i] = () =&gt; { Console.WriteLine(i); };\n  }\n  return result;\n}\n\n\n\n  only one instance of the iteration variable is captured, which produces the output:\n\n\n3\n3\n3\n\n\n\n  end example]\n\n\nOh yea, I guess it should be mentioned that in C++ this problem doesn&apos;t occur because you can choose if the variable

<p>Yes - take a copy of the variable inside the loop:</p>

<p>You can think of it as if the C# compiler creates a "new" local variable every time it hits the variable declaration. In fact it'll create appropriate new closure objects, and it gets complicated (in terms of implementation) if you refer to variables in multiple scopes, but it works :)</p>

<p>Note that a more common occurrence of this problem is using <code>for</code> or <code>foreach</code>:</p>

<p>Note that as of the C# 5 compiler and beyond (even when specifying an earlier version of C#), the behavior of <code>foreach</code> changed so you no longer need to make local copy. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8898925/is-there-a-reason-for-cs-reuse-of-the-variable-in-a-foreach/8899347#8899347">this answer</a> for more details.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, the compiler is generating a class that represents the closure for your method call. It uses that single instance of the closure class for each iteration of the loop. The code looks something like this, which makes it easier to see why the bug happens:</p>

<h1>This has nothing to do with loops. </h1>

<p>This behavior is triggered because you use a lambda expression <code>() =&gt; variable * 2</code> where the outer scoped <code>variable</code> not actually defined in the lambda's inner scope. </p>

<p>Lambda expressions (in C#3+, as well as anonymous methods in C#2) still create actual methods. Passing variables to these methods involve some dilemmas (pass by value? pass by reference? C# goes with by reference - but this opens another problem where the reference can outlive the actual variable). What C# does to resolve all these dilemmas is to create a new helper class ("closure") with fields corresponding to the local variables used in the lambda expressions, and methods corresponding to the actual lambda methods. Any changes to <code>variable</code> in your code is actually translated to change in that <code>ClosureClass.variable</code></p>

<p>So your while loop keeps updating the <code>ClosureClass.variable</code> until it reaches 10, then you for loops executes the actions, which all operate on the same <code>ClosureClass.variable</code>.</p>

<p>To get your expected result, you need to create a separation between the loop variable, and the variable that is being closured. You can do this by introducing another variable, i.e.:</p>

<pre class="lang-cs s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp">List&lt;Func&lt;<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>&gt;&gt; actions = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> List&lt;Func&lt;<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>&gt;&gt;();
<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> variable = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> (variable &lt; <span class="hljs-number">5</span>)
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> t = variable; <span class="hljs-comment">// now t will be closured (i.e. replaced by a field in the new class)</span>
    actions.Add(() =&gt; t * <span class="hljs-number">2</span>);
    ++variable; <span class="hljs-comment">// changing variable won't affect the closured variable t</span>
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">foreach</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> act <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> actions)
{
    Console.WriteLine(act.Invoke());
}
</code></pre>

<p>You could also move the closure to another method to create this separation:</p>

<pre class="lang-cs s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp">List&lt;Func&lt;<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>&gt;&gt; actions = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> List&lt;Func&lt;<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>&gt;&gt;();

<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> variable = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> (variable &lt; <span class="hljs-number">5</span>)
{
    actions.Add(Mult(variable));
    ++variable;
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">foreach</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> act <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> actions)
{
    Console.WriteLine(act.Invoke());
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can implement Mult as a lambda expression (implicit closure) </p>

<pre class="lang-cs s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> Func&lt;<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>&gt; <span class="hljs-title">Mult</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> i</span>)</span>
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> () =&gt; i * <span class="hljs-number">2</span>;
}
</code></pre>

<p>or with an actual helper class:</p>

<pre class="lang-cs s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Helper</span>
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> _i;
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-title">Helper</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> i</span>)</span>
    {
        _i = i;
    }
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> <span class="hljs-title">Method</span>()</span>
    {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> _i * <span class="hljs-number">2</span>;
    }
}

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> Func&lt;<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>&gt; <span class="hljs-title">Mult</span>(<span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> i</span>)</span>
{
    Helper help = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Helper(i);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> help.Method;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In any case, <strong>"Closures" are NOT a concept related to loops</strong>, but rather to anonymous methods / lambda expressions use of local scoped variables - although some incautious use of loops demonstrate closures traps.</p>

  <p>[Example: For example, when the following method is invoked, the local variable <code>x</code> is instantiated and initialized three timesonce for each iteration of the loop.</p>

  <p>end example]</p>
  
  <p>When not captured, there is no way to observe exactly how often a local variable is instantiatedbecause the lifetimes of the instantiations are disjoint, it is possible for each instantation to simply use the same storage location. However, when an anonymous function captures a local variable, the effects of instantiation become apparent.</p>

<p>Oh yea, I guess it should be mentioned that in C++ this problem doesn't occur because you can choose if the variable is captured by value or by reference (see: <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lambda#Lambda_capture" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Lambda capture</a>).</p>

Passing variables to these methods involve some dilemmas (pass by value? pass by reference? C# goes with by reference - but this opens another problem where the reference can outlive the actual variable). What C# does to resolve all these dilemmas is to create a new helper class (\u0026quot;closure\u0026quot;) with fields corresponding to the local variables used in the lambda expressions, and methods corresponding to the actual lambda methods. Any changes to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;variable\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; in your code is actually translated to change in that \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ClosureClass.variable\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So your while loop keeps updating the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ClosureClass.variable\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; until it reaches 10, then you for loops executes the actions, which all operate on the same \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ClosureClass.variable\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;To get your expected result, you need to create a separation between the loop variable, and the variable that is being closured.
