That means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. In your example, $.ajax returns immediately and the next statement, return result;, is executed before the function you passed as success callback was even called.\nHere is an analogy which hopefully makes the difference between synchronous and asynchronous flow clearer:\nSynchronous\nImagine you make a phone call to a friend and ask him to look something up for you. Although it might take a while, you wait on the phone and stare into space, until your friend gives you the answer that you needed.\nThe same is happening when you make a function call containing &quot;normal&quot; code:\nfunction findItem() {\n    var item;\n    while(item_not_found) {\n        // search\n    }\n    return item;\n}\n\nvar item = findItem();\n\n// Do something with item\ndoSomethingElse();\n\nEven though findItem might take a long time to execute, any code coming after var item = findItem(); has to wait until the function returns the result.\nAsynchronous\nYou call your friend again for the same reason. But this time you tell him that you are in a hurry and he should call you back on your mobile phone. You hang up, leave the house, and do whatever you planned to do. Once your friend calls you back, you are dealing with the information he gave to you.\nThat&apos;s exactly what&apos;s happening when you do an Ajax request.\nfindItem(function(item) {\n    // Do something with the item\n});\ndoSomethingElse();\n\nInstead of waiting for the response, the execution continues immediately and the statement after the Ajax call is executed. To get the response eventually, you provide a function to be called once the response was received, a callback (notice something? call back ?). Any statement coming after that call is executed before the callback is called.\n\nSolution(s)\nEmbrace the asynchronous nature of JavaScript! While certain asynchronous operations provide synchronous counterparts (so does &quot;Ajax&quot;), it&apos;s generally discouraged to use them, especially in a browser context.\nWhy is it bad do you ask?\nJavaScript runs in the UI thread of the browser and any long-running process will lock the UI, making it unresponsive. Additionally, there is an upper limit on the execution time for JavaScript and the browser will ask the user whether to continue the execution or not.\nAll of this results in a really bad user experience. The user won&apos;t be able to tell whether everything is working fine or not. Furthermore, the effect will be worse for users with a slow connection.\nIn the following we will look at three different solutions that are all building on top of each other:\n\nPromises with async/await (ES2017+, available in older browsers if you use a transpiler or regenerator)\nCallbacks (popular in node)\nPromises with then() (ES2015+, available in older browsers if you use one of the many promise libraries)\n\nAll three are available in current browsers, and node 7+.\n\nES2017+: Promises with async/await\nThe ECMAScript version released in 2017 introduced syntax-level support for asynchronous functions. With the help of async and await, you can write asynchronous in a &quot;synchronous style&quot;. The code is still asynchronous, but it&apos;s easier to read/understand.\nasync/await builds on top of promises: an async function always returns a promise. await &quot;unwraps&quot; a promise and either result in the value the promise was resolved with or throws an error if the promise was rejected.\nImportant: You can only use await inside an async function or in a JavaScript module. Top-level await is not supported outside of modules, so you might have to make an async IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to start an async context if not using a module.\nYou can read more about async and await on MDN.\nHere is an example that elaborates the delay function findItem() above:\n// Using &apos;superagent&apos; which will return a promise.\nvar superagent = require(&apos;superagent&apos;)\n\n// This is isn&apos;t declared as `async` because it already returns a promise\nfunction delay() {\n  // `delay` returns a promise\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // Only `delay` is able to resolve or reject the promise\n    setTimeout(function() {\n      resolve(42); // After 3 seconds, resolve the promise with value 42\n    }, 3000);\n  });\n}\n\nasync function getAllBooks() {\n  try {\n    // GET a list of book IDs of the current user\n    var bookIDs = await superagent.get(&apos;/user/books&apos;);\n    // wait for 3 seconds (just for the sake of this example)\n    await delay();\n    // GET information about each book\n    return superagent.get(&apos;/books/ids=&apos;+JSON.stringify(bookIDs));\n  } catch(error) {\n    // If any of the awaited promises was rejected, this catch block\n    // would catch the rejection reason\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n\n// Start an IIFE to use `await` at the top level\n(async function(){\n  let books = await getAllBooks();\n  console.log(books);\n})();\n\nCurrent browser and node versions support async/await. You can also support older environments by transforming your code to ES5 with the help of regenerator (or tools that use regenerator, such as Babel).\n\nLet functions accept callbacks\nA callback is when function 1 is passed to function 2. Function 2 can call function 1 whenever it is ready. In the context of an asynchronous process, the callback will be called whenever the asynchronous process is done. Usually, the result is passed to the callback.\nIn the example of the question, you can make foo accept a callback and use it as success callback. So this\nvar result = foo();\n// Code that depends on &apos;result&apos;\n\nbecomes\nfoo(function(result) {\n    // Code that depends on &apos;result&apos;\n});\n\nHere we defined the function &quot;inline&quot; but you can pass any function reference:\nfunction myCallback(result) {\n    // Code that depends on &apos;result&apos;\n}\n\nfoo(myCallback);\n\nfoo itself is defined as follows:\nfunction foo(callback) {\n    $.ajax({\n        // ...\n        success: callback\n    });\n}\n\ncallback will refer to the function we pass to foo when we call it and we pass it on to success. I.e. once the Ajax request is successful, $.ajax will call callback and pass the response to the callback (which can be referred to with result, since this is how we defined the callback).\nYou can also process the response before passing it to the callback:\nfunction foo(callback) {\n    $.ajax({\n        // ...\n        success: function(response) {\n            // For example, filter the response\n            callback(filtered_response);\n        }\n    });\n}\n\nIt&apos;s easier to write code using callbacks than it may seem. After all, JavaScript in the browser is heavily event-driven (DOM events). Receiving the Ajax response is nothing else but an event.\nDifficulties could arise when you have to work with third-party code, but most problems can be solved by just thinking through the application flow.\n\nES2015+: Promises with then()\nThe Promise API is a new feature of ECMAScript 6 (ES2015), but it has good browser support already. There are also many libraries which implement the standard Promises API and provide additional methods to ease the use and composition of asynchronous functions (e.g., bluebird).\nPromises are containers for future values. When the promise receives the value (it is resolved) or when it is canceled (rejected), it notifies all of its &quot;listeners&quot; who want to access this value.\nThe advantage over plain callbacks is that they allow you to decouple your code and they are easier to compose.\nHere is an example of using a promise:\n\n\nfunction delay() {\n  // `delay` returns a promise\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // Only `delay` is able to resolve or reject the promise\n    setTimeout(function() {\n      resolve(42); // After 3 seconds, resolve the promise with value 42\n    }, 3000);\n  });\n}\n\ndelay()\n  .then(function(v) { // `delay` returns a promise\n    console.log(v); // Log the value once it is resolved\n  })\n  .catch(function(v) {\n    // Or do something else if it is rejected\n    // (it would not happen in this example, since `reject` is not called).\n  });\n.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\nApplied to our Ajax call we could use promises like this:\n\n\nfunction ajax(url) {\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    xhr.onload = function() {\n      resolve(this.responseText);\n    };\n    xhr.onerror = reject;\n    xhr.open(&apos;GET&apos;, url);\n    xhr.send();\n  });\n}\n\najax(&quot;https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1&quot;)\n  .then(function(result) {\n    console.log(result); // Code depending on result\n  })\n  .catch(function() {\n    // An error occurred\n  });\n.as-console-wrapper { max-height: 100% !important; top: 0; }\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\nDescribing all the advantages that promise offer is beyond the scope of this answer, but if you write new code, you should seriously consider them. They provide a great abstraction and separation of your code.\nMore information about promises: HTML5 rocks - JavaScript Promises.\nSide note: jQuery&apos;s deferred objects\nDeferred objects are jQuery&apos;s custom implementation of promises (before the Promise API was standardized). They behave almost like promises but expose a slightly different API.\nEvery Ajax method of jQuery already returns a &quot;deferred object&quot; (actually a promise of a deferred object) which you can just return from your function:\nfunction ajax() {\n    return $.ajax(...);\n}\n\najax().done(function(result) {\n    // Code depending on result\n}).fail(function() {\n    // An error occurred\n});\n\nSide note: Promise gotchas\nKeep in mind that promises and deferred objects are just containers for a future value, they are not the value itself. For example, suppose you had the following:\nfunction checkPassword() {\n    return $.ajax({\n        url: &apos;/password&apos;,\n        data: {\n            username: $(&apos;#username&apos;).val(),\n            password: $(&apos;#password&apos;).val()\n        },\n        type: &apos;POST&apos;,\n        dataType: &apos;json&apos;\n    });\n}\n\nif (checkPassword()) {\n    // Tell the user they&apos;re logged in\n}\n\nThis code misunderstands the above asynchronous issues. Specifically, $.ajax() doesn&apos;t freeze the code while it checks the &apos;/password&apos; page on your server - it sends a request to the server and while it waits, it immediately returns a jQuery Ajax Deferred object, not the response from the server. That means the if statement is going to always get this Deferred object, treat it as true, and proceed as though the user is logged in. Not good.\nBut the fix is easy:\ncheckPassword()\n.done(function(r) {\n    if (r) {\n        // Tell the user they&apos;re logged in\n    } else {\n        // Tell the user their password was bad\n    }\n})\n.fail(function(x) {\n    // Tell the user something bad happened\n});\n\n\nNot recommended: Synchronous &quot;Ajax&quot; calls\nAs I mentioned, some(!) asynchronous operations have synchronous counterparts. I don&apos;t advocate their use, but for completeness&apos; sake, here is how you would perform a synchronous call:\nWithout jQuery\nIf you directly use a XMLHttpRequest object, pass false as third argument to .open.\njQuery\nIf you use jQuery, you can set the async option to false. Note that this option is deprecated since jQuery 1.8.\nYou can then either still use a success callback or access the responseText property of the jqXHR object:\nfunction foo() {\n    var jqXHR = $.ajax({\n        //...\n        async: false\n    });\n    return jqXHR.responseText;\n}\n\nIf you use any other jQuery Ajax method, such as $.get, $.getJSON, etc., you have to change it to $.ajax (since you can only pass configuration parameters to $.ajax).\nHeads up! It is not possible to make a synchronous JSONP request. JSONP by its very nature is always asynchronous (one more reason to not even consider this option).\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"If you&apos;re not using jQuery in your code, this answer is for you\nYour code should be something along the lines of this:\nfunction foo() {\n    var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    httpRequest.open(&apos;GET&apos;, &quot;/echo/json&quot;);\n    httpRequest.send();\n    return httpRequest.responseText;\n}\n\nvar result = foo(); // Always ends up being &apos;undefined&apos;\n\nFelix Kling did a fine job writing an answer for people using jQuery for AJAX, but I&apos;ve decided to provide an alternative for people who aren&apos;t.\n(Note, for those using the new fetch API, Angular or promises I&apos;ve added another answer below)\n\nWhat you&apos;re facing\nThis is a short summary of &quot;Explanation of the problem&quot; from the other answer, if you&apos;re not sure after reading this, read that.\nThe A in AJAX stands for asynchronous. That means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. In your example, .send returns immediately and the next statement, return result;, is executed before the function you passed as success callback was even called.\nThis means when you&apos;re returning, the listener you&apos;ve defined did not execute yet, which means the value you&apos;re returning has not been defined.\nHere is a simple analogy:\nfunction getFive(){\n    var a;\n    setTimeout(function(){\n         a=5;\n    },10);\n    return a;\n}\n\n(Fiddle)\nThe value of a returned is undefined since the a=5 part has not executed yet. AJAX acts like this, you&apos;re returning the value before the server got the chance to tell your browser what that value is.\nOne possible solution to this problem is to code re-actively , telling your program what to do when the calculation completed.\nfunction onComplete(a){ // When the code completes, do this\n    alert(a);\n}\n\nfunction getFive(whenDone){\n    var a;\n    setTimeout(function(){\n         a=5;\n         whenDone(a);\n    },10);\n}\n\nThis is called CPS. Basically, we&apos;re passing getFive an action to perform when it completes, we&apos;re telling our code how to react when an event completes (like our AJAX call, or in this case the timeout).\nUsage would be:\ngetFive(onComplete);\n\nWhich should alert &quot;5&quot; to the screen. (Fiddle).\nPossible solutions\nThere are basically two ways how to solve this:\n\nMake the AJAX call synchronous (lets call it SJAX).\nRestructure your code to work properly with callbacks.\n\n1. Synchronous AJAX - Don&apos;t do it!!\nAs for synchronous AJAX, don&apos;t do it! Felix&apos;s answer raises some compelling arguments about why it&apos;s a bad idea. To sum it up, it&apos;ll freeze the user&apos;s browser until the server returns the response and create a very bad user experience. Here is another short summary taken from MDN on why:\n\nXMLHttpRequest supports both synchronous and asynchronous communications. In general, however, asynchronous requests should be preferred to synchronous requests for performance reasons.\nIn short, synchronous requests block the execution of code... ...this can cause serious issues...\n\nIf you have to do it, you can pass a flag. Here is how:\nvar request = new XMLHttpRequest();\nrequest.open(&apos;GET&apos;, &apos;yourURL&apos;, false);  // `false` makes the request synchronous\nrequest.send(null);\n\nif (request.status === 200) {// That&apos;s HTTP for &apos;ok&apos;\n  console.log(request.responseText);\n}\n\n2. Restructure code\nLet your function accept a callback. In the example code foo can be made to accept a callback. We&apos;ll be telling our code how to react when foo completes.\nSo:\nvar result = foo();\n// Code that depends on `result` goes here\n\nBecomes:\nfoo(function(result) {\n    // Code that depends on `result`\n});\n\nHere we passed an anonymous function, but we could just as easily pass a reference to an existing function, making it look like:\nfunction myHandler(result) {\n    // Code that depends on `result`\n}\nfoo(myHandler);\n\nFor more details on how this sort of callback design is done, check Felix&apos;s answer.\nNow, let&apos;s define foo itself to act accordingly\nfunction foo(callback) {\n    var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    httpRequest.onload = function(){ // When the request is loaded\n       callback(httpRequest.responseText);// We&apos;re calling our method\n    };\n    httpRequest.open(&apos;GET&apos;, &quot;/echo/json&quot;);\n    httpRequest.send();\n}\n\n(fiddle)\nWe have now made our foo function accept an action to run when the AJAX completes successfully. We can extend this further by checking if the response status is not 200 and acting accordingly (create a fail handler and such). Effectively it is solving our issue.\nIf you&apos;re still having a hard time understanding this, read the AJAX getting started guide at MDN.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"XMLHttpRequest 2 (first of all, read the answers from Benjamin Gruenbaum and Felix Kling)\nIf you don&apos;t use jQuery and want a nice short XMLHttpRequest 2 which works in the modern browsers and also in the mobile browsers, I suggest to use it this way:\nfunction ajax(a, b, c){ // URL, callback, just a placeholder\n  c = new XMLHttpRequest;\n  c.open(&apos;GET&apos;, a);\n  c.onload = b;\n  c.send()\n}\n\nAs you can see:\n\nIt&apos;s shorter than all other functions Listed.\nThe callback is set directly (so no extra unnecessary closures).\nIt uses the new onload (so you don&apos;t have to check for readystate &amp;&amp; status)\nThere are some other situations, which I don&apos;t remember, that make the XMLHttpRequest 1 annoying.\n\nThere are two ways to get the response of this Ajax call (three using the XMLHttpRequest var name):\nThe simplest:\nthis.response\n\nOr if for some reason you bind() the callback to a class:\ne.target.response\n\nExample:\nfunction callback(e){\n  console.log(this.response);\n}\najax(&apos;URL&apos;, callback);\n\nOr (the above one is better anonymous functions are always a problem):\najax(&apos;URL&apos;, function(e){console.log(this.response)});\n\nNothing easier.\nNow some people will probably say that it&apos;s better to use onreadystatechange or the even the XMLHttpRequest variable name. That&apos;s wrong.\nCheck out XMLHttpRequest advanced features.\nIt supported all *modern browsers. And I can confirm as I have been using this approach since XMLHttpRequest 2 was created. I never had any type of problem in any browsers I used.\nonreadystatechange is only useful if you want to get the headers on state 2.\nUsing the XMLHttpRequest variable name is another big error as you need to execute the callback inside the onload/oreadystatechange closures, or else you lost it.\n\nNow if you want something more complex using POST and FormData you can easily extend this function:\nfunction x(a, b, e, d, c){ // URL, callback, method, formdata or {key:val},placeholder\n  c = new XMLHttpRequest;\n  c.open(e||&apos;get&apos;, a);\n  c.onload = b;\n  c.send(d||null)\n}\n\nAgain ... it&apos;s a very short function, but it does GET and POST.\nExamples of usage:\nx(url, callback); // By default it&apos;s GET so no need to set\nx(url, callback, &apos;post&apos;, {&apos;key&apos;: &apos;val&apos;}); // No need to set POST data\n\nOr pass a full form element (document.getElementsByTagName(&apos;form&apos;)[0]):\nvar fd = new FormData(form);\nx(url, callback, &apos;post&apos;, fd);\n\nOr set some custom values:\nvar fd = new FormData();\nfd.append(&apos;key&apos;, &apos;val&apos;)\nx(url, callback, &apos;post&apos;, fd);\n\nAs you can see, I didn&apos;t implement sync... it&apos;s a bad thing.\nHaving said that ... why don&apos;t we do it the easy way?\n\nAs mentioned in the comment, the use of error &amp;&amp; synchronous does completely break the point of the answer. Which is a nice short way to use Ajax in the proper way?\nError handler\nfunction x(a, b, e, d, c){ // URL, callback, method, formdata or {key:val}, placeholder\n  c = new XMLHttpRequest;\n  c.open(e||&apos;get&apos;, a);\n  c.onload = b;\n  c.onerror = error;\n  c.send(d||null)\n}\n\nfunction error(e){\n  console.log(&apos;--Error--&apos;, this.type);\n  console.log(&apos;this: &apos;, this);\n  console.log(&apos;Event: &apos;, e)\n}\nfunction displayAjax(e){\n  console.log(e, this);\n}\nx(&apos;WRONGURL&apos;, displayAjax);\n\nIn the above script, you have an error handler which is statically defined, so it does not compromise the function. The error handler can be used for other functions too.\nBut to really get out an error, the only way is to write a wrong URL in which case every browser throws an error.\nError handlers are maybe useful if you set custom headers, set the responseType to blob array buffer, or whatever...\nEven if you pass &apos;POSTAPAPAP&apos; as the method it won&apos;t throw an error.\nEven if you pass &apos;fdggdgilfdghfldj&apos; as formdata it won&apos;t throw an error.\nIn the first case the error is inside the displayAjax() under this.statusText as Method not Allowed.\nIn the second case, it simply works. You have to check at the server side if you passed the right post data.\nCross-domain not allowed throws an error automatically.\nIn the error response, there aren&apos;t any error codes.\nThere is only the this.type which is set to error.\nWhy add an error handler if you totally don&apos;t have any control over errors?\nMost of the errors are returned inside this in the callback function displayAjax().\nSo: There isn&apos;t any need for error checks if you&apos;re able to copy and paste the URL properly. ;)\nPS: As the first test I wrote x(&apos;x&apos;, displayAjax)..., and it totally got a response...??? So I checked the folder where the HTML is located, and there was a file called &apos;x.xml&apos;. So even if you forget the extension of your file XMLHttpRequest 2 WILL FIND IT. I LOL&apos;d\n\nRead a file synchronous\nDon&apos;t do that.\nIf you want to block the browser for a while load a nice big .txt file synchronous.\nfunction omg(a, c){ // URL\n  c = new XMLHttpRequest;\n  c.open(&apos;GET&apos;, a, true);\n  c.send();\n  return c; // Or c.response\n}\n\nNow you can do\n var res = omg(&apos;thisIsGonnaBlockThePage.txt&apos;);\n\nThere is no other way to do this in a non-asynchronous way. (Yeah, with setTimeout loop... but seriously?)\nAnother point is... if you work with APIs or just your own list&apos;s files or whatever you always use different functions for each request...\nOnly if you have a page where you load always the same XML/JSON or whatever you need only one function. In that case, modify a little the Ajax function and replace b with your special function.\n\nThe functions above are for basic use.\nIf you want to extend the function...\nYes, you can.\nI&apos;m using a lot of APIs and one of the first functions I integrate into every HTML page is the first Ajax function in this answer, with GET only...\nBut you can do a lot of stuff with XMLHttpRequest 2:\nI made a download manager (using ranges on both sides with resume, filereader, and filesystem), various image resizers converters using canvas, populate web SQL databases with base64images and much more...\nBut in these cases you should create a function only for that purpose... sometimes you need a blob, array buffers, you can set headers, override mimetype and there is a lot more...\nBut the question here is how to return an Ajax response... (I added an easy way.)\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"If you&apos;re using promises, this answer is for you.\nThis means AngularJS, jQuery (with deferred), native XHR&apos;s replacement (fetch), Ember.js, Backbone.js&apos;s save or any Node.js library that returns promises.\nYour code should be something along the lines of this:\nfunction foo() {\n    var data;\n    // Or $.get(...).then, or request(...).then, or query(...).then\n    fetch(&quot;/echo/json&quot;).then(function(response){\n        data = response.json();\n    });\n    return data;\n}\n\nvar result = foo(); // &apos;result&apos; is always undefined no matter what.\n\nFelix Kling did a fine job writing an answer for people using jQuery with callbacks for Ajax. I have an answer for native XHR. This answer is for generic usage of promises either on the frontend or backend.\n\nThe core issue\nThe JavaScript concurrency model in the browser and on the server with Node.js/io.js is asynchronous and reactive.\nWhenever you call a method that returns a promise, the then handlers are always executed asynchronously - that is, after the code below them that is not in a .then handler.\nThis means when you&apos;re returning data the then handler you&apos;ve defined did not execute yet. This in turn means that the value you&apos;re returning has not been set to the correct value in time.\nHere is a simple analogy for the issue:\n\n\n    function getFive(){\n        var data;\n        setTimeout(function(){ // Set a timer for one second in the future\n           data = 5; // After a second, do this\n        }, 1000);\n        return data;\n    }\n    document.body.innerHTML = getFive(); // `undefined` here and not 5\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\nThe value of data is undefined since the data = 5 part has not executed yet. It will likely execute in a second, but by that time it is irrelevant to the returned value.\nSince the operation did not happen yet (Ajax, server call, I/O, and timer) you&apos;re returning the value before the request got the chance to tell your code what that value is.\nOne possible solution to this problem is to code re-actively, telling your program what to do when the calculation completed. Promises actively enable this by being temporal (time-sensitive) in nature.\nQuick recap on promises\nA Promise is a value over time. Promises have state. They start as pending with no value and can settle to:\n\nfulfilled meaning that the computation completed successfully.\nrejected meaning that the computation failed.\n\nA promise can only change states once after which it will always stay at the same state forever. You can attach then handlers to promises to extract their value and handle errors. then handlers allow chaining of calls. Promises are created by using APIs that return them. For example, the more modern Ajax replacement fetch or jQuery&apos;s $.get return promises.\nWhen we call .then on a promise and return something from it - we get a promise for the processed value. If we return another promise we&apos;ll get amazing things, but let&apos;s hold our horses.\nWith promises\nLet&apos;s see how we can solve the above issue with promises. First, let&apos;s demonstrate our understanding of promise states from above by using the Promise constructor for creating a delay function:\nfunction delay(ms){ // Takes amount of milliseconds\n    // Returns a new promise\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n        setTimeout(function(){ // When the time is up,\n            resolve(); // change the promise to the fulfilled state\n        }, ms);\n    });\n}\n\nNow, after we converted setTimeout to use promises, we can use then to make it count:\n\n\nfunction delay(ms){ // Takes amount of milliseconds\n  // Returns a new promise\n  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    setTimeout(function(){ // When the time is up,\n      resolve(); // change the promise to the fulfilled state\n    }, ms);\n  });\n}\n\nfunction getFive(){\n  // We&apos;re RETURNING the promise. Remember, a promise is a wrapper over our value\n  return delay(100).then(function(){ // When the promise is ready,\n      return 5; // return the value 5. Promises are all about return values\n  })\n}\n// We _have_ to wrap it like this in the call site, and we can&apos;t access the plain value\ngetFive().then(function(five){\n   document.body.innerHTML = five;\n});\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\nBasically, instead of returning a value which we can&apos;t do because of the concurrency model - we&apos;re returning a wrapper for a value that we can unwrap with then. It&apos;s like a box you can open with then.\nApplying this\nThis stands the same for your original API call, you can:\nfunction foo() {\n    // RETURN the promise\n    return fetch(&quot;/echo/json&quot;).then(function(response){\n        return response.json(); // Process it inside the `then`\n    });\n}\n\nfoo().then(function(response){\n    // Access the value inside the `then`\n})\n\nSo this works just as well. We&apos;ve learned we can&apos;t return values from already asynchronous calls, but we can use promises and chain them to perform processing. We now know how to return the response from an asynchronous call.\nES2015 (ES6)\nES6 introduces generators which are functions that can return in the middle and then resume the point they were at. This is typically useful for sequences, for example:\nfunction* foo(){ // Notice the star. This is ES6, so new browsers, Nodes.js, and io.js only\n    yield 1;\n    yield 2;\n    while(true) yield 3;\n}\n\nIs a function that returns an iterator over the sequence 1,2,3,3,3,3,.... which can be iterated. While this is interesting on its own and opens room for a lot of possibility, there is one particular interesting case.\nIf the sequence we&apos;re producing is a sequence of actions rather than numbers - we can pause the function whenever an action is yielded and wait for it before we resume the function. So instead of a sequence of numbers, we need a sequence of future values - that is: promises.\nThis somewhat a tricky, but very powerful trick lets us write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner. There are several &quot;runners&quot; that do this for you. Writing one is a short few lines of code, but it is beyond the scope of this answer. I&apos;ll be using Bluebird&apos;s Promise.coroutine here, but there are other wrappers like co or Q.async.\nvar foo = coroutine(function*(){\n    var data = yield fetch(&quot;/echo/json&quot;); // Notice the yield\n    // The code here only executes _after_ the request is done\n    return data.json(); // &apos;data&apos; is defined\n});\n\nThis method returns a promise itself, which we can consume from other coroutines. For example:\nvar main = coroutine(function*(){\n   var bar = yield foo(); // Wait our earlier coroutine. It returns a promise\n   // The server call is done here, and the code below executes when done\n   var baz = yield fetch(&quot;/api/users/&quot; + bar.userid); // Depends on foo&apos;s result\n   console.log(baz); // Runs after both requests are done\n});\nmain();\n\nES2016 (ES7)\nIn ES7, this is further standardized. There are several proposals right now, but in all of them you can await promise. This is just &quot;sugar&quot; (nicer syntax) for the ES6 proposal above by adding the async and await keywords. Making the above example:\nasync function foo(){\n    var data = await fetch(&quot;/echo/json&quot;); // Notice the await\n    // code here only executes _after_ the request is done\n    return data.json(); // &apos;data&apos; is defined\n}\n\nIt still returns a promise just the same :)\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You are using Ajax incorrectly.

As the other answers have pointed out, you can&apos;t; you have to have your function accept and call a callback (or return a Promise).

If you want to run them one after another, you need to wait for each operation to complete before you start the next.

For example, in promises we have some function like success() or then() which will be executed when your data is ready for you. The same with callback or the subscribe function on an observable.\nFor example, in your case which you are using jQuery, you can do something like this:\n$(document).ready(function(){\n    function foo() {\n        $.ajax({url: &quot;api/data&quot;, success: function(data){\n            fooDone(data); // After we have data, we pass it to fooDone\n        }});\n    };\n\n    function fooDone(data) {\n        console.log(data); // fooDone has the data and console.log it\n    };\n\n    foo(); // The call happens here\n});\n\nFor more information, study promises and observables which are newer ways to do this async stuff.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution11","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"It&apos;s a very common issue we face while struggling with the &apos;mysteries&apos; of JavaScript. Let me try demystifying this mystery today.\nLet&apos;s start with a simple JavaScript function:\nfunction foo(){\n    // Do something\n    return &apos;wohoo&apos;;\n}\n\nlet bar = foo(); // &apos;bar&apos; is &apos;wohoo&apos; here\n\nThat&apos;s a simple synchronous function call (where each line of code is &apos;finished with its job&apos; before the next one in sequence), and the result is same as expected.\nNow let&apos;s add a bit of twist, by introducing a little delay in our function, so that all lines of code are not &apos;finished&apos; in sequence. Thus, it will emulate the asynchronous behavior of the function:\nfunction foo(){\n    setTimeout( ()=&gt; {\n        return &apos;wohoo&apos;;\n   }, 1000)\n}\n\nlet bar = foo() // &apos;bar&apos; is undefined here\n\nSo there you go; that delay just broke the functionality we expected! But what exactly happened? Well, it&apos;s actually pretty logical if you look at the code.\nThe function foo(), upon execution, returns nothing (thus returned value is undefined), but it does start a timer, which executes a function after 1 second to return &apos;wohoo&apos;. But as you can see, the value that&apos;s assigned to bar is the immediately returned stuff from foo(), which is nothing, i.e., just undefined.\nSo, how do we tackle this issue?\nLet&apos;s ask our function for a promise.\nPromise is really about what it means: it means that the function guarantees you to provide with any output it gets in future. So let&apos;s see it in action for our little problem above:\nfunction foo(){\n   return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; { // I want foo() to PROMISE me something\n    setTimeout ( function(){\n      // Promise is RESOLVED, when the execution reaches this line of code\n       resolve(&apos;wohoo&apos;) // After 1 second, RESOLVE the promise with value &apos;wohoo&apos;\n    }, 1000 )\n  })\n}\n\nlet bar;\nfoo().then( res =&gt; {\n    bar = res;\n    console.log(bar) // Will print &apos;wohoo&apos;\n});\n\nThus, the summary is - to tackle the asynchronous functions like Ajax-based calls, etc., you can use a promise to resolve the value (which you intend to return). Thus, in short you resolve value instead of returning, in asynchronous functions.\nUPDATE (Promises with async/await)\nApart from using then/catch to work with promises, there exists one more approach. The idea is to recognize an asynchronous function and then wait for the promises to resolve, before moving to the next line of code. It&apos;s still just the promises under the hood, but with a different syntactical approach. To make things clearer, you can find a comparison below:\nthen/catch version:\nfunction saveUsers(){\n     getUsers()\n      .then(users =&gt; {\n         saveSomewhere(users);\n      })\n      .catch(err =&gt; {\n          console.error(err);\n       })\n }\n\nasync/await version:\n  async function saveUsers(){\n     try{\n        let users = await getUsers()\n        saveSomewhere(users);\n     }\n     catch(err){\n        console.error(err);\n     }\n  }\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution12","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Another approach to return a value from an asynchronous function, is to pass in an object that will store the result from the asynchronous function.\n\nHere is an example of the same:\n\nvar async = require(&quot;async&quot;);\n\n// This wires up result back to the caller\nvar result = {};\nvar asyncTasks = [];\nasyncTasks.push(function(_callback){\n    // some asynchronous operation\n    $.ajax({\n        url: &apos;...&apos;,\n        success: function(response) {\n            result.response = response;\n            _callback();\n        }\n    });\n});\n\nasync.parallel(asyncTasks, function(){\n    // result is available after performing asynchronous operation\n    console.log(result)\n    console.log(&apos;Done&apos;);\n});\n\n\nI am using the result object to store the value during the asynchronous operation.

The event queue is where all your functions are pushed on some event (example: click).\nThis is one by one carried out of queue and put into the event loop which executes this function and prepares itself for the next one after the first one is executed. This means execution of one function doesn&apos;t start until the function before it in the queue is executed in the event loop.\nNow let us think we pushed two functions in a queue. One is for getting a data from the server and another utilises that data. We pushed the serverRequest() function in the queue first and then the utiliseData() function. The serverRequest function goes in the event loop and makes a call to server as we never know how much time it will take to get data from server, so this process is expected to take time and so we busy our event loop thus hanging our page.\nThat&apos;s where Web API come into the role. It takes this function from the event loop and deals with the server making the event loop free, so that we can execute the next function from the queue.\nThe next function in the queue is utiliseData() which goes in the loop, but because of no data available, it goes to waste and execution of the next function continues until the end of the queue. (This is called Async calling, i.e., we can do something else until we get data.)\nLet us suppose our serverRequest() function had a return statement in code. When we get back data from the server Web API, it will push it in the queue at the end of queue.\nAs it gets pushed at the end of the queue, we cannot utilise its data as there isn&apos;t any function left in our queue to utilise this data. Thus it is not possible to return something from the async call.\nThus the solution to this is callback or promise.\n\nAn image from one of the answers here correctly explains callback use...*\n\nWe give our function (function utilising data returned from the server) to a function calling the server.\n\nfunction doAjax(callbackFunc, method, url) {\n    var xmlHttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();\n    xmlHttpReq.open(method, url);\n    xmlHttpReq.onreadystatechange = function() {\n\n        if (xmlHttpReq.readyState == 4 &amp;&amp; xmlHttpReq.status == 200) {\n            callbackFunc(xmlHttpReq.responseText);\n        }\n    }\n    xmlHttpReq.send(null);\n}\n\nIn my code it is called as:\nfunction loadMyJson(categoryValue){\n    if(categoryValue === &quot;veg&quot;)\n        doAjax(print, &quot;GET&quot;, &quot;http://localhost:3004/vegetables&quot;);\n    else if(categoryValue === &quot;fruits&quot;)\n        doAjax(print, &quot;GET&quot;, &quot;http://localhost:3004/fruits&quot;);\n    else\n      console.log(&quot;Data not found&quot;);\n}\n\nJavaScript.info callback\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution17","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"2017 answer: you can now do exactly what you want in every current browser and Node.js\nThis is quite simple:\n\nReturn a Promise\nUse the &apos;await&apos;, which will tell JavaScript to await the promise to be resolved into a value (like the HTTP response)\nAdd the &apos;async&apos; keyword to the parent function\n\nHere&apos;s a working version of your code:\n(async function(){\n\n    var response = await superagent.get(&apos;...&apos;)\n    console.log(response)\n\n})()\n\nawait is supported in all current browsers and Node.js 8\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution18","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You can use this custom library (written using Promise) to make a remote call.\n\nfunction $http(apiConfig) {\n    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\n        var client = new XMLHttpRequest();\n        client.open(apiConfig.method, apiConfig.url);\n        client.send();\n        client.onload = function () {\n            if (this.status &gt;= 200 &amp;&amp; this.status &lt; 300) {\n                // Performs the function &quot;resolve&quot; when this.status is equal to 2xx.\n                // Your logic here.\n                resolve(this.response);\n            }\n            else {\n                // Performs the function &quot;reject&quot; when this.status is different than 2xx.\n                reject(this.statusText);\n            }\n        };\n        client.onerror = function () {\n            reject(this.statusText);\n        };\n    });\n}\n\n\nSimple usage example:\n\n$http({\n    method: &apos;get&apos;,\n    url: &apos;google.com&apos;\n}).then(function(response) {\n    console.log(response);\n}, function(error) {\n    console.log(error)\n});\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution19","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Another solution is to execute code via the sequential executor nsynjs.\nIf the underlying function is promisified\nnsynjs will evaluate all promises sequentially, and put the promise result into the data property:\n\n\nfunction synchronousCode() {\n\n    var getURL = function(url) {\n        return window.fetch(url).data.text().data;\n    };\n    \n    var url = &apos;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js&apos;;\n    console.log(&apos;received bytes:&apos;,getURL(url).length);\n    \n};\n\nnsynjs.run(synchronousCode,{},function(){\n    console.log(&apos;synchronousCode done&apos;);\n});\n&lt;script src=&quot;https://rawgit.com/amaksr/nsynjs/master/nsynjs.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\nIf the underlying function is not promisified\nStep 1.

We don&apos;t really understand what time is, but we have developed abstractions and vocabulary that let us reason and talk about it: &quot;past&quot;, &quot;present&quot;, &quot;future&quot;, &quot;before&quot;, &quot;after&quot;.\nThe computer systems we build--more and more--have time as an important dimension. Certain things are set up to happen in the future. Then other things need to happen after those first things eventually occur. This is the basic notion called &quot;asynchronicity&quot;. In our increasingly networked world, the most common case of asynchronicity is waiting for some remote system to respond to some request.\nConsider an example. You call the milkman and order some milk. When it comes, you want to put it in your coffee. You can&apos;t put the milk in your coffee right now, because it is not here yet. You have to wait for it to come before putting it in your coffee. In other words, the following won&apos;t work:\nvar milk = order_milk();\nput_in_coffee(milk);\n\nBecause JavaScript has no way to know that it needs to wait for order_milk to finish before it executes put_in_coffee. In other words, it does not know that order_milk is asynchronous--is something that is not going to result in milk until some future time. JavaScript, and other declarative languages execute one statement after another without waiting.\nThe classic JavaScript approach to this problem, taking advantage of the fact that JavaScript supports functions as first-class objects which can be passed around, is to pass a function as a parameter to the asynchronous request, which it will then invoke when it has completed its task sometime in the future. That is the &quot;callback&quot; approach. It looks like this:\norder_milk(put_in_coffee);\n\norder_milk kicks off, orders the milk, then, when and only when it arrives, it invokes put_in_coffee.\nThe problem with this callback approach is that it pollutes the normal semantics of a function reporting its result with return; instead, functions must not reports their results by calling a callback given as a parameter. Also, this approach can rapidly become unwieldy when dealing with longer sequences of events. For example, let&apos;s say that I want to wait for the milk to be put in the coffee, and then and only then perform a third step, namely drinking the coffee. I end up needing to write something like this:\norder_milk(function(milk) { put_in_coffee(milk, drink_coffee); }\n\nwhere I am passing to put_in_coffee both the milk to put in it, and also the action (drink_coffee) to execute once the milk has been put in. Such code becomes hard to write, and read, and debug.\nIn this case, we could rewrite the code in the question as:\nvar answer;\n$.ajax(&apos;/foo.json&apos;) . done(function(response) {\n  callback(response.data);\n});\n\nfunction callback(data) {\n  console.log(data);\n}\n\nEnter promises\nThis was the motivation for the notion of a &quot;promise&quot;, which is a particular type of value which represents a future or asynchronous outcome of some sort. It can represent something that already happened, or that is going to happen in the future, or might never happen at all. Promises have a single method, named then, to which you pass an action to be executed when the outcome the promise represents has been realized.\nIn the case of our milk and coffee, we design order_milk to return a promise for the milk arriving, then specify put_in_coffee as a then action, as follows:\norder_milk() . then(put_in_coffee)\n\nOne advantage of this is that we can string these together to create sequences of future occurrences (&quot;chaining&quot;):\norder_milk() . then(put_in_coffee) . then(drink_coffee)\n\nLet&apos;s apply promises to your particular problem. We will wrap our request logic inside a function, which returns a promise:\nfunction get_data() {\n  return $.ajax(&apos;/foo.json&apos;);\n}\n\nActually, all we&apos;ve done is added a return to the call to $.ajax. This works because jQuery&apos;s $.ajax already returns a kind of promise-like thing. (In practice, without getting into details, we would prefer to wrap this call so as for return a real promise, or use some alternative to $.ajax that does so.) Now, if we want to load the file and wait for it to finish and then do something, we can simply say\nget_data() . then(do_something)\n\nfor instance,\nget_data() .\n  then(function(data) { console.log(data); });\n\nWhen using promises, we end up passing lots of functions into then, so it&apos;s often helpful to use the more compact ES6-style arrow functions:\nget_data() .\n  then(data =&gt; console.log(data));\n\nThe async keyword\nBut there&apos;s still something vaguely dissatisfying about having to write code one way if synchronous and a quite different way if asynchronous. For synchronous, we write\na();\nb();\n\nbut if a is asynchronous, with promises we have to write\na() . then(b);\n\nAbove, we said, &quot;JavaScript has no way to know that it needs to wait for the first call to finish before it executes the second&quot;. Wouldn&apos;t it be nice if there was some way to tell JavaScript that? It turns out that there is--the await keyword, used inside a special type of function called an &quot;async&quot; function. This feature is part of the upcoming version of ECMAScript (ES), but it is already available in transpilers such as Babel given the right presets. This allows us to simply write\nasync function morning_routine() {\n  var milk   = await order_milk();\n  var coffee = await put_in_coffee(milk);\n  await drink(coffee);\n}\n\nIn your case, you would be able to write something like\nasync function foo() {\n  data = await get_data();\n  console.log(data);\n}\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution22","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Short answer: Your foo() method returns immediately, while the $ajax() call executes asynchronously after the function returns.

The queue is the list of things that are waiting to execute (like your AJAX request). imagine it like this:\n\ncall foo.com/api/bar using foobarFunc\nGo perform an infinite loop\n... and so on\n\nWhen one of these messages is going to execute it pops the message from the queue and creates a stack, the stack is everything JavaScript needs to execute to perform the instruction in the message. So in our example it&apos;s being told to call foobarFunc\nfunction foobarFunc (var) {\n  console.log(anotherFunction(var));\n}\n\nSo anything that foobarFunc needs to execute (in our case anotherFunction) will get pushed onto the stack. executed, and then forgotten about - the event loop will then move onto the next thing in the queue (or listen for messages)\nThe key thing here is the order of execution. That is\nWHEN is something going to run\nWhen you make a call using AJAX to an external party or run any asynchronous code (a setTimeout for example), JavaScript is dependant upon a response before it can proceed.\nThe big question is when will it get the response? The answer is we don&apos;t know - so the event loop is waiting for that message to say &quot;hey run me&quot;. If JavaScript just waited around for that message synchronously your app would freeze and it will suck. So JavaScript carries on executing the next item in the queue whilst waiting for the message to get added back to the queue.\nThat&apos;s why with asynchronous functionality we use things called callbacks. - A function or handler that, when passed into another function, will be executed at a later date. A promise uses callbacks (functions passed to .then() for example) as a way to reason about this asynchronous behaviour in a more linear way. The promise is a way of saying &quot;I promise to return something at some point&quot; and the callback is how we handle that value that is eventually returned. jQuery uses specific callbacks called deffered.done deffered.fail and deffered.always (amongst others). You can see them all here\nSo what you need to do is pass a function that is promised to execute at some point with data that is passed to it.\nBecause a callback is not executed immediately but at a later time it&apos;s important to pass the reference to the function not it executed. so\nfunction foo(bla) {\n  console.log(bla)\n}\n\nso most of the time (but not always) you&apos;ll pass foo not foo()\nHopefully that will make some sense. When you encounter things like this that seem confusing - i highly recommend reading the documentation fully to at least get an understanding of it. It will make you a much better developer.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution30","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0}],"@type":"Question"}}</script><meta name="next-head-count" content="16"/><link

<p>How do I return the response/result from a function <code>foo</code> that makes an asynchronous request?</p>
<p>I am trying to return the value from the callback, as well as assigning the result to a local variable inside the function and returning that one, but none of those ways actually return the response — they all return <code>undefined</code> or whatever the initial value of the variable <code>result</code> is.</p>
<p><strong>Example of an asynchronous function that accepts a callback</strong> (using jQuery's <code>ajax</code> function):</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> result;

    $.<span class="hljs-title function_">ajax</span>({
        <span class="hljs-attr">url</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'...'</span>,
        <span class="hljs-attr">success</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">response</span>) {
            result = response;
            <span class="hljs-comment">// return response; // &lt;- I tried that one as well</span>
        }
    });

    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> result; <span class="hljs-comment">// It always returns `undefined`</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example using Node.js:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {

    });

    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> result; <span class="hljs-comment">// It always returns `undefined`</span>

<p><em> For a more general explanation of asynchronous behaviour with different examples, see</em> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/23667086/218196">Why is my variable unaltered after I modify it inside of a function? - Asynchronous code reference</a></p>
<p><em> If you already understand the problem, skip to the possible solutions below.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h1>The problem</h1>
<p>The <strong>A</strong> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)" rel="noreferrer">Ajax</a> stands for <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/asynchronous" rel="noreferrer"><strong>asynchronous</strong></a>. That means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. In your example, <code>$.ajax</code> returns immediately and the next statement, <code>return result;</code>, is executed before the function you passed as <code>success</code> callback was even called.</p>
<p>Here is an analogy which hopefully makes the difference between synchronous and asynchronous flow clearer:</p>
<h2>Synchronous</h2>
<p>Imagine you make a phone call to a friend and ask him to look something up for you. Although it might take a while, you wait on the phone and stare into space, until your friend gives you the answer that you needed.</p>
<p>The same is happening when you make a function call containing "normal" code:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">findItem</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> item;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span>(item_not_found) {
        <span class="hljs-comment">// search</span>
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> item;
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> item = <span class="hljs-title function_">findItem</span>();

<span class="hljs-comment">// Do something with item</span>
<span class="hljs-title function_">doSomethingElse</span>();
</code></pre>
<p>Even though <code>findItem</code> might take a long time to execute, any code coming after <code>var item = findItem();</code> has to <em>wait</em> until the function returns the result.</p>
<h2>Asynchronous</h2>
<p>You call your friend again for the same reason. But this time you tell him that you are in a hurry and he should <em>call you back</em> on your mobile phone. You hang up, leave the house, and do whatever you planned to do. Once your friend calls you back, you are dealing with the information he gave to you.</p>
<p>That's exactly what's happening when you do an Ajax request.</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">findItem</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">item</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Do something with the item</span>
});
<span class="hljs-title function_">doSomethingElse</span>();
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of waiting for the response, the execution continues immediately and the statement after the Ajax call is executed. To get the response eventually, you provide a function to be called once the response was received, a <em>callback</em> (notice something? <em>call back</em> ?). Any statement coming after that call is executed before the callback is called.</p>
<hr>
<h1>Solution(s)</h1>
<p><strong>Embrace the asynchronous nature of JavaScript!</strong> While certain asynchronous operations provide synchronous counterparts (so does "Ajax"), it's generally discouraged to use them, especially in a browser context.</p>
<p>Why is it bad do you ask?</p>
<p>JavaScript runs in the UI thread of the browser and any long-running process will lock the UI, making it unresponsive. Additionally, there is an upper limit on the execution time for JavaScript and the browser will ask the user whether to continue the execution or not.</p>
<p>All of this results in a really bad user experience. The user won't be able to tell whether everything is working fine or not. Furthermore, the effect will be worse for users with a slow connection.</p>
<p>In the following we will look at three different solutions that are all building on top of each other:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Promises with <code>async/await</code></strong> (ES2017+, available in older browsers if you use a transpiler or regenerator)</li>
<li><strong>Callbacks</strong> (popular in node)</li>
<li><strong>Promises with <code>then()</code></strong> (ES2015+, available in older browsers if you use one of the many promise libraries)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All three are available in current browsers, and node 7+.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>ES2017+: Promises with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function" rel="noreferrer"><code>async/await</code></a></h2>
<p>The ECMAScript version released in 2017 introduced <em>syntax-level support</em> for asynchronous functions. With the help of <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>, you can write asynchronous in a "synchronous style". The code is still asynchronous, but it's easier to read/understand.</p>
<p><code>async/await</code> builds on top of promises: an <code>async</code> function always returns a promise. <code>await</code> "unwraps" a promise and either result in the value the promise was resolved with or throws an error if the promise was rejected.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> You can only use <code>await</code> inside an <code>async</code> function or in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules" rel="noreferrer">JavaScript module</a>. Top-level <code>await</code> is not supported outside of modules, so you might have to make an async IIFE (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately_invoked_function_expression" rel="noreferrer">Immediately Invoked Function Expression</a>) to start an <code>async</code> context if not using a module.</p>
<p>You can read more about <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function" rel="noreferrer"><code>async</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await" rel="noreferrer"><code>await</code></a> on MDN.</p>

<h2>Let functions accept <em>callbacks</em></h2>
<p>A callback is when function 1 is passed to function 2. Function 2 can call function 1 whenever it is ready. In the context of an asynchronous process, the callback will be called whenever the asynchronous process is done. Usually, the result is passed to the callback.</p>
<p>In the example of the question, you can make <code>foo</code> accept a callback and use it as <code>success</code> callback. So this</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> result = <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>();
<span class="hljs-comment">// Code that depends on 'result'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>becomes</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">result</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Code that depends on 'result'</span>
});
</code></pre>
<p>Here we defined the function "inline" but you can pass any function reference:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">myCallback</span>(<span class="hljs-params">result</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Code that depends on 'result'</span>
}

<span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(myCallback);
</code></pre>
<p><code>foo</code> itself is defined as follows:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params">callback</span>) {
    $.<span class="hljs-title function_">ajax</span>({
        <span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
        <span class="hljs-attr">success</span>: callback
    });
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>callback</code> will refer to the function we pass to <code>foo</code> when we call it and we pass it on to <code>success</code>. I.e. once the Ajax request is successful, <code>$.ajax</code> will call <code>callback</code> and pass the response to the callback (which can be referred to with <code>result</code>, since this is how we defined the callback).</p>
<p>You can also process the response before passing it to the callback:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params">callback</span>) {
    $.<span class="hljs-title function_">ajax</span>({
        <span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
        <span class="hljs-attr">success</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">response</span>) {
            <span class="hljs-comment">// For example, filter the response</span>
            <span class="hljs-title function_">callback</span>(filtered_response);
        }
    });
}
</code></pre>
<p>It's easier to write code using callbacks than it may seem. After all, JavaScript in the browser is heavily event-driven (DOM events). Receiving the Ajax response is nothing else but an event.
Difficulties could arise when you have to work with third-party code, but most problems can be solved by just thinking through the application flow.</p>

<h2>ES2015+: Promises with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise" rel="noreferrer">then()</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise" rel="noreferrer">Promise API</a> is a new feature of ECMAScript 6 (ES2015), but it has good <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=promises" rel="noreferrer" title="caniuse">browser support</a> already. There are also many libraries which implement the standard Promises API and provide additional methods to ease the use and composition of asynchronous functions (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird" rel="noreferrer">bluebird</a>).</p>
<p>Promises are containers for <em>future</em> values. When the promise receives the value (it is <em>resolved</em>) or when it is canceled (<em>rejected</em>), it notifies all of its "listeners" who want to access this value.</p>
<p>The advantage over plain callbacks is that they allow you to decouple your code and they are easier to compose.</p>
<p>Here is an example of using a promise:</p>
<p></p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">

<p>Describing all the advantages that promise offer is beyond the scope of this answer, but if you write new code, you should seriously consider them. They provide a great abstraction and separation of your code.</p>

<h3>Side note: jQuery's deferred objects</h3>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4866721/what-are-deferred-objects">Deferred objects</a> are jQuery's custom implementation of promises (before the Promise API was standardized). They behave almost like promises but expose a slightly different API.</p>
<p>Every Ajax method of jQuery already returns a "deferred object" (actually a promise of a deferred object) which you can just return from your function:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">ajax</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> $.<span class="hljs-title function_">ajax</span>(...);
}

<span class="hljs-title function_">ajax</span>().<span class="hljs-title function_">done</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">result</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Code depending on result</span>
}).<span class="hljs-title function_">fail</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// An error occurred</span>
});
</code></pre>
<h3>Side note: Promise gotchas</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that promises and deferred objects are just <em>containers</em> for a future value, they are not the value itself. For example, suppose you had the following:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">checkPassword</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> $.<span class="hljs-title function_">ajax</span>({
        <span class="hljs-attr">url</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'/password'</span>,
        <span class="hljs-attr">data</span>: {
            <span class="hljs-attr">username</span>: $(<span class="hljs-string">'#username'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">val</span>(),
            <span class="hljs-attr">password</span>: $(<span class="hljs-string">'#password'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">val</span>()
        },
        <span class="hljs-attr">type</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'POST'</span>,
        <span class="hljs-attr">dataType</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'json'</span>
    });
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-title function_">checkPassword</span>()) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Tell the user they're logged in</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>This code misunderstands the above asynchronous issues. Specifically, <code>$.ajax()</code> doesn't freeze the code while it checks the '/password' page on your server - it sends a request to the server and while it waits, it immediately returns a jQuery Ajax Deferred object, not the response from the server. That means the <code>if</code> statement is going to always get this Deferred object, treat it as <code>true</code>, and proceed as though the user is logged in. Not good.</p>
<p>But the fix is easy:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">checkPassword</span>()
.<span class="hljs-title function_">done</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">r</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (r) {
        <span class="hljs-comment">// Tell the user they're logged in</span>
    } <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
        <span class="hljs-comment">// Tell the user their password was bad</span>
    }
})
.<span class="hljs-title function_">fail</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">x</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Tell the user something bad happened</span>
});
</code></pre>

<h2>Not recommended: Synchronous "Ajax" calls</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, some(!) asynchronous operations have synchronous counterparts. I don't advocate their use, but for completeness' sake, here is how you would perform a synchronous call:</p>
<h3>Without jQuery</h3>
<p>If you directly use a <a href="https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/" rel="noreferrer"><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></a> object, pass <code>false</code> as third argument to <a href="https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#the-open()-method" rel="noreferrer"><code>.open</code></a>.</p>
<h3>jQuery</h3>
<p>If you use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/" rel="noreferrer">jQuery</a>, you can set the <code>async</code> option to <code>false</code>. Note that this option is <em>deprecated</em> since jQuery 1.8.
You can then either still use a <code>success</code> callback or access the <code>responseText</code> property of the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR" rel="noreferrer">jqXHR object</a>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> jqXHR = $.<span class="hljs-title function_">ajax</span>({
        <span class="hljs-comment">//...</span>
        <span class="hljs-attr">async</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>
    });
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> jqXHR.<span class="hljs-property">responseText</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you use any other jQuery Ajax method, such as <code>$.get</code>, <code>$.getJSON</code>, etc., you have to change it to <code>$.ajax</code> (since you can only pass configuration parameters to <code>$.ajax</code>).</p>
<p><strong>Heads up!</strong> It is not possible to make a synchronous <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2067472/please-explain-jsonp">JSONP</a> request. JSONP by its very nature is always asynchronous (one more reason to not even consider this option).</p>

<p>(<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/30180679/1348195">Note, for those using the new <code>fetch</code> API, Angular or promises I've added another answer below</a>)</p>
<hr>
<h1>What you're facing</h1>
<p>This is a short summary of "Explanation of the problem" from the other answer, if you're not sure after reading this, read that.</p>
<p>The <strong>A</strong> in AJAX stands for <strong>asynchronous</strong>. That means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. In your example, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#send%28%29" rel="noreferrer"><code>.send</code></a> returns immediately and the next statement, <code>return result;</code>, is executed before the function you passed as <code>success</code> callback was even called.</p>
<p>This means when you're returning, the listener you've defined did not execute yet, which means the value you're returning has not been defined.</p>
<p>Here is a simple analogy:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">getFive</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a;
    <span class="hljs-built_in">setTimeout</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
         a=<span class="hljs-number">5</span>;
    },<span class="hljs-number">10</span>);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> a;
}
</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/7RK3k/" rel="noreferrer">(Fiddle)</a></p>
<p>The value of <code>a</code> returned is <code>undefined</code> since the <code>a=5</code> part has not executed yet. AJAX acts like this, you're returning the value before the server got the chance to tell your browser what that value is.</p>
<p>One possible solution to this problem is to code <em>re-actively</em> , telling your program what to do when the calculation completed.</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">onComplete</span>(<span class="hljs-params">a</span>){ <span class="hljs-comment">// When the code completes, do this</span>
    <span class="hljs-title function_">alert</span>(a);
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">getFive</span>(<span class="hljs-params">whenDone</span>){
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a;
    <span class="hljs-built_in">setTimeout</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
         a=<span class="hljs-number">5</span>;
         <span class="hljs-title function_">whenDone</span>(a);
    },<span class="hljs-number">10</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style" rel="noreferrer">CPS</a>. Basically, we're passing <code>getFive</code> an action to perform when it completes, we're telling our code how to react when an event completes (like our AJAX call, or in this case the timeout).</p>
<p>Usage would be:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">getFive</span>(onComplete);
</code></pre>
<p>Which should alert "5" to the screen. <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/PAjZR/" rel="noreferrer">(Fiddle)</a>.</p>
<h1>Possible solutions</h1>
<p>There are basically two ways how to solve this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make the AJAX call synchronous (lets call it SJAX).</li>
<li>Restructure your code to work properly with callbacks.</li>
</ol>
<h2>1. Synchronous AJAX - Don't do it!!</h2>
<p>As for synchronous AJAX, <strong>don't do it!</strong> Felix's answer raises some compelling arguments about why it's a bad idea. To sum it up, it'll freeze the user's browser until the server returns the response and create a very bad user experience. Here is another short summary taken from MDN on why:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>XMLHttpRequest supports both synchronous and asynchronous communications. In general, however, asynchronous requests should be preferred to synchronous requests for performance reasons.</p>
<p>In short, synchronous requests block the execution of code... ...this can cause serious issues...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you <em>have</em> to do it, you can pass a flag. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Synchronous_and_Asynchronous_Requests#Synchronous_request" rel="noreferrer">Here is how</a>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> request = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">XMLHttpRequest</span>();
request.<span class="hljs-title function_">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'GET'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'yourURL'</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>);  <span class="hljs-comment">// `false` makes the request synchronous</span>
request.<span class="hljs-title function_">send</span>(<span class="hljs-literal">null</span>);

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (request.<span class="hljs-property">status</span> === <span class="hljs-number">200</span>) {<span class="hljs-comment">// That's HTTP for 'ok'</span>
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(request.<span class="hljs-property">responseText</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<h2>2. Restructure code</h2>
<p>Let your function accept a callback. In the example code <code>foo</code> can be made to accept a callback. We'll be telling our code how to <em>react</em> when <code>foo</code> completes.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> result = <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>();
<span class="hljs-comment">// Code that depends on `result` goes here</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Becomes:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">result</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Code that depends on `result`</span>
});
</code></pre>
<p>Here we passed an anonymous function, but we could just as easily pass a reference to an existing function, making it look like:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">myHandler</span>(<span class="hljs-params">result</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Code that depends on `result`</span>
}
<span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(myHandler);
</code></pre>
<p>For more details on how this sort of callback design is done, check Felix's answer.</p>
<p>Now, let's define foo itself to act accordingly</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params">callback</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> httpRequest = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">XMLHttpRequest</span>();
    httpRequest.<span class="hljs-property">onload</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){ <span class="hljs-comment">// When the request is loaded</span>
       <span class="hljs-title function_">callback</span>(httpRequest.<span class="hljs-property">responseText</span>);<span class="hljs-comment">// We're calling our method</span>
    };
    httpRequest.<span class="hljs-title function_">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'GET'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"/echo/json"</span>);
    httpRequest.<span class="hljs-title function_">send</span>();
}
</code></pre>
<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/DAcWT/" rel="noreferrer">(fiddle)</a></p>
<p>We have now made our <em>foo</em> function accept an action to run when the AJAX completes successfully. We can extend this further by checking if the response status is not 200 and acting accordingly (create a fail handler and such). Effectively it is solving our issue.</p>
<p>If you're still having a hard time understanding this, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started" rel="noreferrer">read the AJAX getting started guide</a> at MDN.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest" rel="noreferrer">XMLHttpRequest</a> 2</strong> (first of all, read the answers from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/16825593/19068">Benjamin Gruenbaum</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/14220323/19068">Felix Kling</a>)</p>
<p>If you don't use jQuery and want a nice short XMLHttpRequest 2 which works in the modern browsers and also in the mobile browsers, I suggest to use it this way:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">ajax</span>(<span class="hljs-params">a, b, c</span>){ <span class="hljs-comment">// URL, callback, just a placeholder</span>
  c = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">XMLHttpRequest</span>;
  c.<span class="hljs-title function_">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'GET'</span>, a);
  c.<span class="hljs-property">onload</span> = b;
  c.<span class="hljs-title function_">send</span>()
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's shorter than all other functions Listed.</li>
<li>The callback is set directly (so no extra unnecessary closures).</li>
<li>It uses the new onload (so you don't have to check for readystate &amp;&amp; status)</li>
<li>There are some other situations, which I don't remember, that make the XMLHttpRequest 1 annoying.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two ways to get the response of this Ajax call (three using the XMLHttpRequest var name):</p>
<p>The simplest:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">response</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Or if for some reason you <code>bind()</code> the callback to a class:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">e.<span class="hljs-property">target</span>.<span class="hljs-property">response</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">callback</span>(<span class="hljs-params">e</span>){
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">response</span>);
}
<span class="hljs-title function_">ajax</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'URL'</span>, callback);
</code></pre>
<p>Or (the above one is better anonymous functions are always a problem):</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">ajax</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'URL'</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">e</span>){<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">response</span>)});
</code></pre>
<p>Nothing easier.</p>
<p>Now some people will probably say that it's better to use onreadystatechange or the even the XMLHttpRequest variable name. That's wrong.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="http://caniuse.com/xhr2" rel="noreferrer">XMLHttpRequest advanced features</a>.</p>
<p>It supported all *modern browsers. And I can confirm as I have been using this approach since XMLHttpRequest 2 was created. I never had any type of problem in any browsers I used.</p>
<p>onreadystatechange is only useful if you want to get the headers on state 2.</p>
<p>Using the <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> variable name is another big error as you need to execute the callback inside the onload/oreadystatechange closures, or else you lost it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now if you want something more complex using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_%28HTTP%29" rel="noreferrer">POST</a> and FormData you can easily extend this function:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">x</span>(<span class="hljs-params">a, b, e, d, c</span>){ <span class="hljs-comment">// URL, callback, method, formdata or {key:val},placeholder</span>
  c = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">XMLHttpRequest</span>;
  c.<span class="hljs-title function_">open</span>(e||<span class="hljs-string">'get'</span>, a);
  c.<span class="hljs-property">onload</span> = b;
  c.<span class="hljs-title function_">send</span>(d||<span class="hljs-literal">null</span>)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Again ... it's a very short function, but it does <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods" rel="noreferrer">GET</a> and POST.</p>
<p>Examples of usage:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">x</span>(url, callback); <span class="hljs-comment">// By default it's GET so no need to set</span>
<span class="hljs-title function_">x</span>(url, callback, <span class="hljs-string">'post'</span>, {<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'val'</span>}); <span class="hljs-comment">// No need to set POST data</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Or pass a full form element (<code>document.getElementsByTagName('form')[0]</code>):</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> fd = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">FormData</span>(form);
<span class="hljs-title function_">x</span>(url, callback, <span class="hljs-string">'post'</span>, fd);
</code></pre>
<p>Or set some custom values:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> fd = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">FormData</span>();
fd.<span class="hljs-title function_">append</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'val'</span>)
<span class="hljs-title function_">x</span>(url, callback, <span class="hljs-string">'post'</span>, fd);
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, I didn't implement sync... it's a bad thing.</p>
<p>Having said that ... why don't we do it the easy way?</p>
<hr>
<p>As mentioned in the comment, the use of error &amp;&amp; synchronous does completely break the point of the answer. Which is a nice short way to use Ajax in the proper way?</p>
<p><em>Error handler</em></p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">x</span>(<span class="hljs-params">a, b, e, d, c</span>){ <span class="hljs-comment">// URL, callback, method, formdata or {key:val}, placeholder</span>
  c = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">XMLHttpRequest</span>;
  c.<span class="hljs-title function_">open</span>(e||<span class="hljs-string">'get'</span>, a);
  c.<span class="hljs-property">onload</span> = b;
  c.<span class="hljs-property">onerror</span> = error;
  c.<span class="hljs-title function_">send</span>(d||<span class="hljs-literal">null</span>)
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">error</span>(<span class="hljs-params">e</span>){
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'--Error--'</span>, <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">type</span>);
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'this: '</span>, <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>);
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Event: '</span>, e)
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">displayAjax</span>(<span class="hljs-params">e</span>){
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(e, <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>);
}
<span class="hljs-title function_">x</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'WRONGURL'</span>, displayAjax);
</code></pre>
<p>In the above script, you have an error handler which is statically defined, so it does not compromise the function. The error handler can be used for other functions too.</p>
<p>But to really get out an error, the <strong>only</strong> way is to write a wrong URL in which case every browser throws an error.</p>
<p>Error handlers are maybe useful if you set custom headers, set the responseType to blob array buffer, or whatever...</p>
<p>Even if you pass 'POSTAPAPAP' as the method it won't throw an error.</p>
<p>Even if you pass 'fdggdgilfdghfldj' as formdata it won't throw an error.</p>
<p>In the first case the error is inside the <code>displayAjax()</code> under <code>this.statusText</code> as <code>Method not Allowed</code>.</p>
<p>In the second case, it simply works. You have to check at the server side if you passed the right post data.</p>
<p>Cross-domain not allowed throws an error automatically.</p>
<p>In the error response, there aren't any error codes.</p>
<p>There is only the <code>this.type</code> which is set to <em>error</em>.</p>
<p>Why add an error handler if you totally don't have any control over errors?
Most of the errors are returned inside this in the callback function <code>displayAjax()</code>.</p>
<p>So: There isn't any need for error checks if you're able to copy and paste the URL properly. ;)</p>
<p><em>PS: As the first test I wrote x('x', displayAjax)..., and it totally got a response...??? So I checked the folder where the HTML is located, and there was a file called 'x.xml'. So even if you forget the extension of your file XMLHttpRequest 2 WILL FIND IT</em>. I LOL'd</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Read a file synchronous</em></p>
<p><strong>Don't do that.</strong></p>
<p>If you want to block the browser for a while load a nice big <code>.txt</code> file synchronous.</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">omg</span>(<span class="hljs-params">a, c</span>){ <span class="hljs-comment">// URL</span>
  c = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">XMLHttpRequest</span>;
  c.<span class="hljs-title function_">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'GET'</span>, a, <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>);
  c.<span class="hljs-title function_">send</span>();
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> c; <span class="hljs-comment">// Or c.response</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can do</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"> <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> res = <span class="hljs-title function_">omg</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'thisIsGonnaBlockThePage.txt'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>There is no other way to do this in a non-asynchronous way. (Yeah, with setTimeout loop... but seriously?)</p>
<p>Another point is... if you work with APIs or just your own list's files or whatever you always use different functions for each request...</p>
<p>Only if you have a page where you load always the same XML/JSON or whatever you need only one function. In that case, modify a little the Ajax function and replace b with your special function.</p>
<hr>
<p>The functions above are for basic use.</p>
<p>If you want to <em>extend</em> the function...</p>
<p>Yes, you can.</p>
<p>I'm using a lot of APIs and one of the first functions I integrate into every HTML page is the first Ajax function in this answer, with GET only...</p>
<p>But you can do a lot of stuff with XMLHttpRequest 2:</p>
<p>I made a download manager (using ranges on both sides with resume, filereader, and filesystem), various image resizers converters using canvas, populate web SQL databases with base64images and much more...</p>
<p>But in these cases you should create a function only for that purpose... sometimes you need a blob, array buffers, you can set headers, override mimetype and there is a lot more...</p>
<p>But the question here is how to return an Ajax response... (I added an easy way.)</p>

I have an answer for native XHR. This answer is for generic usage of promises either on the frontend or backend.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The core issue</h2>
<p>The JavaScript concurrency model in the browser and on the server with Node.js/io.js is <em>asynchronous</em> and <em>reactive</em>.</p>
<p>Whenever you call a method that returns a promise, the <code>then</code> handlers are <em>always</em> executed asynchronously - that is, <strong>after</strong> the code below them that is not in a <code>.then</code> handler.</p>
<p>This means when you're returning <code>data</code> the <code>then</code> handler you've defined did not execute yet. This in turn means that the value you're returning has not been set to the correct value in time.</p>
<p>Here is a simple analogy for the issue:</p>
<p></p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="false" data-babel="false">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">    <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">getFive</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> data;
        <span class="hljs-built_in">setTimeout</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){ <span class="hljs-comment">// Set a timer for one second in the future</span>
           data = <span class="hljs-number">5</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// After a second, do this</span>
        }, <span class="hljs-number">1000</span>);
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> data;
    }
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-property">body</span>.<span class="hljs-property">innerHTML</span> = <span class="hljs-title function_">getFive</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// `undefined` here and not 5</span></code></pre>
<div class="snippet-result"><div class="snippet-ctas"><button type="button" class="s-btn s-btn__primary"><span class="icon-play-white _hover"></span><span> Run code snippet</span></button><input class="copySnippet s-btn s-btn__filled" type="button" value="Copy snippet to answer" style="display: none;"><button type="button" class="s-btn hideResults" style="display: none;">Hide results</button><div class="popout-code"><a class="snippet-expand-link">Expand snippet</a></div></div><div class="snippet-result-code" style="display: none;"><iframe name="sif3" sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-scripts" class="snippet-box-edit snippet-box-result" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></div></div>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>The value of <code>data</code> is <code>undefined</code> since the <code>data = 5</code> part has not executed yet. It will likely execute in a second, but by that time it is irrelevant to the returned value.</p>
<p>Since the operation did not happen yet (Ajax, server call, I/O, and timer) you're returning the value before the request got the chance to tell your code what that value is.</p>
<p>One possible solution to this problem is to code <em>re-actively</em>, telling your program what to do when the calculation completed. Promises actively enable this by being temporal (time-sensitive) in nature.</p>
<h3>Quick recap on promises</h3>
<p>A Promise is a <em>value over time</em>. Promises have state. They start as pending with no value and can settle to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>fulfilled</strong> meaning that the computation completed successfully.</li>
<li><strong>rejected</strong> meaning that the computation failed.</li>
</ul>
<p>A promise can only change states <em>once</em> after which it will always stay at the same state forever. You can attach <code>then</code> handlers to promises to extract their value and handle errors. <code>then</code> handlers allow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22539815/arent-promises-just-callbacks">chaining</a> of calls. Promises are created by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22519784/how-do-i-convert-an-existing-callback-api-to-promises">using APIs that return them</a>. For example, the more modern Ajax replacement <code>fetch</code> or jQuery's <code>$.get</code> return promises.</p>
<p>When we call <code>.then</code> on a promise and <em>return</em> something from it - we get a promise for <em>the processed value</em>. If we return another promise we'll get amazing things, but let's hold our horses.</p>
<h3>With promises</h3>
<p>Let's see how we can solve the above issue with promises. First, let's demonstrate our understanding of promise states from above by using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/JavaScript_code_modules/Promise.jsm/Promise" rel="noreferrer">Promise constructor</a> for creating a delay function:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">delay</span>(<span class="hljs-params">ms</span>){ <span class="hljs-comment">// Takes amount of milliseconds</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Returns a new promise</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Promise</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">resolve, reject</span>){
        <span class="hljs-built_in">setTimeout</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){ <span class="hljs-comment">// When the time is up,</span>
            <span class="hljs-title function_">resolve</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// change the promise to the fulfilled state</span>
        }, ms);
    });
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, after we <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22519784/how-do-i-convert-an-existing-callback-api-to-promises">converted setTimeout</a> to use promises, we can use <code>then</code> to make it count:</p>

<p>Basically, instead of returning a <em>value</em> which we can't do because of the concurrency model - we're returning a <em>wrapper</em> for a value that we can <em>unwrap</em> with <code>then</code>. It's like a box you can open with <code>then</code>.</p>
<h3>Applying this</h3>
<p>This stands the same for your original API call, you can:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// RETURN the promise</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">fetch</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"/echo/json"</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">then</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">response</span>){
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> response.<span class="hljs-title function_">json</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// Process it inside the `then`</span>
    });
}

<span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>().<span class="hljs-title function_">then</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">response</span>){
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Access the value inside the `then`</span>
})
</code></pre>
<p>So this works just as well. We've learned we can't return values from already asynchronous calls, but we can use promises and chain them to perform processing. We now know how to return the response from an asynchronous call.</p>
<h2>ES2015 (ES6)</h2>
<p>ES6 introduces <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*" rel="noreferrer">generators</a> which are functions that can return in the middle and then resume the point they were at. This is typically useful for sequences, for example:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>* <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){ <span class="hljs-comment">// Notice the star. This is ES6, so new browsers, Nodes.js, and io.js only</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">yield</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">yield</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span>(<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">yield</span> <span class="hljs-number">3</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Is a function that returns an <em>iterator</em> over the sequence <code>1,2,3,3,3,3,....</code> which can be iterated. While this is interesting on its own and opens room for a lot of possibility, there is one particular interesting case.</p>
<p>If the sequence we're producing is a sequence of actions rather than numbers - we can pause the function whenever an action is yielded and wait for it before we resume the function. So instead of a sequence of numbers, we need a sequence of <em>future</em> values - that is: promises.</p>
<p>This somewhat a tricky, but very powerful trick lets us write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner. There are several "runners" that do this for you. Writing one is a short few lines of code, but it is beyond the scope of this answer. I'll be using Bluebird's <code>Promise.coroutine</code> here, but there are other wrappers like <code>co</code> or <code>Q.async</code>.</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> foo = <span class="hljs-title function_">coroutine</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>*(){
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> data = <span class="hljs-keyword">yield</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">fetch</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"/echo/json"</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// Notice the yield</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// The code here only executes _after_ the request is done</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> data.<span class="hljs-title function_">json</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// 'data' is defined</span>
});
</code></pre>
<p>This method returns a promise itself, which we can consume from other coroutines. For example:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> main = <span class="hljs-title function_">coroutine</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>*(){
   <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> bar = <span class="hljs-keyword">yield</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// Wait our earlier coroutine. It returns a promise</span>
   <span class="hljs-comment">// The server call is done here, and the code below executes when done</span>
   <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> baz = <span class="hljs-keyword">yield</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">fetch</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"/api/users/"</span> + bar.<span class="hljs-property">userid</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// Depends on foo's result</span>
   <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(baz); <span class="hljs-comment">// Runs after both requests are done</span>
});
<span class="hljs-title function_">main</span>();
</code></pre>
<h2>ES2016 (ES7)</h2>
<p>In ES7, this is further standardized. There are several proposals right now, but in all of them you can <code>await</code> promise. This is just "sugar" (nicer syntax) for the ES6 proposal above by adding the <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords. Making the above example:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> data = <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">fetch</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"/echo/json"</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// Notice the await</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// code here only executes _after_ the request is done</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> data.<span class="hljs-title function_">json</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// 'data' is defined</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>It still returns a promise just the same :)</p>

<p>The reason that doesn't work is that the callbacks from <code>doSomethingAsync</code> haven't run yet by the time you're trying to use the results.</p>
<p>So, if you have an array (or list of some kind) and want to do async operations for each entry, you have two options: Do the operations in parallel (overlapping), or in series (one after another in sequence).</p>
<h3>Parallel</h3>
<p>You can start all of them and keep track of how many callbacks you're expecting, and then use the results when you've gotten that many callbacks:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> results = [];
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> expecting = theArray.<span class="hljs-property">length</span>;

<p><em>(We could do away with <code>expecting</code> and just use <code>results.length === theArray.length</code>, but that leaves us open to the possibility that <code>theArray</code> is changed while the calls are outstanding...)</em></p>
<p>Notice how we use the <code>index</code> from <code>forEach</code> to save the result in <code>results</code> in the same position as the entry it relates to, even if the results arrive out of order (since async calls don't necessarily complete in the order in which they were started).</p>
<p>But what if you need to <em>return</em> those results from a function? As the other answers have pointed out, you can't; you have to have your function accept and call a callback (or return a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise" rel="noreferrer">Promise</a>).

<p>This is one of the places which <strong>two-way data binding</strong> or <strong>store concept</strong> that's used in many new JavaScript frameworks will work great for you...</p>
<p>So if you are using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(web_framework)" rel="noreferrer">Angular</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(web_framework)" rel="noreferrer">React</a>, or any other frameworks which do two-way data binding or store concept, this issue is simply fixed for you, so in easy words, your result is <code>undefined</code> at the first stage, so you have got <code>result = undefined</code> before you receive the data, then as soon as you get the result, it will be updated and get assigned to the new value which response of your Ajax call...</p>
<p>But how you can do it in pure JavaScript or jQuery for example as you asked in this question?</p>
<p>You can use a callback, promise and recently observable to handle it for you. For example, in promises we have some function like <code>success()</code> or <code>then()</code> which will be executed when your data is ready for you. The same with callback or the <em>subscribe</em> function on an observable.</p>
<p>For example, in your case which you are using jQuery, you can do something like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$(<span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">ready</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){

    <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// The call happens here</span>

<p>It's a very common issue we face while struggling with the 'mysteries' of JavaScript. Let me try demystifying this mystery today.</p>
<p>Let's start with a simple JavaScript function:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Do something</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-string">'wohoo'</span>;
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> bar = <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// 'bar' is 'wohoo' here</span>
</code></pre>
<p>That's a simple synchronous function call (where each line of code is 'finished with its job' before the next one in sequence), and the result is same as expected.</p>
<p>Now let's add a bit of twist, by introducing a little delay in our function, so that all lines of code are not 'finished' in sequence. Thus, it will emulate the asynchronous behavior of the function:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
    <span class="hljs-built_in">setTimeout</span>( <span class="hljs-function">()=&gt;</span> {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-string">'wohoo'</span>;
   }, <span class="hljs-number">1000</span>)
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> bar = <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>() <span class="hljs-comment">// 'bar' is undefined here</span>
</code></pre>
<p>So there you go; that delay just broke the functionality we expected! But what exactly happened? Well, it's actually pretty logical if you look at the code.</p>
<p>The function <code>foo()</code>, upon execution, returns nothing (thus returned value is <code>undefined</code>), but it does start a timer, which executes a function after 1 second to return 'wohoo'. But as you can see, the value that's assigned to bar is the immediately returned stuff from foo(), which is nothing, i.e., just <code>undefined</code>.</p>
<p><strong>So, how do we tackle this issue?</strong></p>
<p>Let's ask our function for a <em>promise</em>.
Promise is really about what it means: it means that the function guarantees you to provide with any output it gets in future. So let's see it in action for our little problem above:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
   <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Promise</span>(<span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">resolve, reject</span>) =&gt;</span> { <span class="hljs-comment">// I want foo() to PROMISE me something</span>
    <span class="hljs-built_in">setTimeout</span> ( <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
      <span class="hljs-comment">// Promise is RESOLVED, when the execution reaches this line of code</span>
       <span class="hljs-title function_">resolve</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'wohoo'</span>) <span class="hljs-comment">// After 1 second, RESOLVE the promise with value 'wohoo'</span>
    }, <span class="hljs-number">1000</span> )
  })
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> bar;
<span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>().<span class="hljs-title function_">then</span>( <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">res</span> =&gt;</span> {
    bar = res;
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(bar) <span class="hljs-comment">// Will print 'wohoo'</span>
});
</code></pre>
<p>Thus, the summary is - to tackle the asynchronous functions like Ajax-based calls, etc., you can use a promise to <code>resolve</code> the value (which you intend to return). Thus, in short you <strong>resolve</strong> value instead of <strong>returning</strong>, in asynchronous functions.</p>
<h2>UPDATE (Promises with async/await)</h2>
<p>Apart from using <code>then/catch</code> to work with promises, there exists one more approach. The idea is to <em>recognize an asynchronous function</em> and then <em>wait for the promises</em> to resolve, before moving to the next line of code. It's still just the <code>promises</code> under the hood, but with a different syntactical approach. To make things clearer, you can find a comparison below:</p>
<h3>then/catch version:</h3>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">saveUsers</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
     <span class="hljs-title function_">getUsers</span>()
      .<span class="hljs-title function_">then</span>(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">users</span> =&gt;</span> {
         <span class="hljs-title function_">saveSomewhere</span>(users);
      })
      .<span class="hljs-title function_">catch</span>(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">err</span> =&gt;</span> {
          <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">error</span>(err);
       })
 }
</code></pre>
<h3>async/await version:</h3>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">  <span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">saveUsers</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){

        <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> users = <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">getUsers</span>()
        <span class="hljs-title function_">saveSomewhere</span>(users);
     }
     <span class="hljs-keyword">catch</span>(err){
        <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">error</span>(err);
     }

<p>Another approach to return a value from an asynchronous function, is to pass in an object that will store the result from the asynchronous function.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the same:</p>

    <span class="hljs-comment">// some asynchronous operation</span>
    $.<span class="hljs-title function_">ajax</span>({

            result.<span class="hljs-property">response</span> = response;

        }
    });
});

<span class="hljs-keyword">async</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">parallel</span>(asyncTasks, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){

    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Done'</span>);
});
</code></pre>

<p>I am using the <code>result</code> object to store the value during the asynchronous operation. This allows the result be available even after the asynchronous job.</p>

<p>I use this approach a lot. I would be interested to know how well this approach works where wiring the result back through consecutive modules is involved.</p>

<p>The following example I have written shows how to</p>

<ul>
<li>Handle asynchronous HTTP calls;</li>
<li>Wait for response from each API call;</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises" rel="noreferrer">Promise</a> pattern;</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all" rel="noreferrer">Promise.all</a> pattern to join multiple HTTP calls;</li>
</ul>

<p>This working example is self-contained. It will define a simple request object that uses the window <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> object to make calls. It will define a simple function to wait for a bunch of promises to be completed.</p>

<p>Context. The example is querying the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/" rel="noreferrer">Spotify Web API</a> endpoint in order to search for <code>playlist</code> objects for a given set of query strings:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">[
 <span class="hljs-string">"search?type=playlist&amp;q=%22doom%20metal%22"</span>,
 <span class="hljs-string">"search?type=playlist&amp;q=Adele"</span>
]
</code></pre>

<p>For each item, a new Promise will fire a block - <code>ExecutionBlock</code>, parse the result, schedule a new set of promises based on the result array, that is a list of Spotify <code>user</code> objects and execute the new HTTP call within the <code>ExecutionProfileBlock</code> asynchronously.</p>

<p>You can then see a nested Promise structure, that lets you spawn multiple and completely asynchronous nested HTTP calls, and join the results from each subset of calls through <code>Promise.all</code>.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>
Recent Spotify <code>search</code> APIs will require an access token to be specified in the request headers:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">-H <span class="hljs-string">"Authorization: Bearer {your access token}"</span> 
</code></pre>

<p>So, you to run the following example you need to put your access token in the request headers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>JavaScript is single threaded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The browser can be divided into three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Event Loop</p>
</li>
<li><p>Web API</p>
</li>
<li><p>Event Queue</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The event loop runs for forever, i.e., kind of an infinite loop. The event queue is where all your functions are pushed on some event (example: click).</p>
<p>This is one by one carried out of queue and put into the event loop which executes this function and prepares itself for the next one after the first one is executed. This means execution of one function doesn't start until the function before it in the queue is executed in the event loop.</p>
<p>Now let us think we pushed two functions in a queue. One is for getting a data from the server and another utilises that data. We pushed the serverRequest() function in the queue first and then the utiliseData() function. The serverRequest function goes in the event loop and makes a call to server as we never know how much time it will take to get data from server, so this process is expected to take time and so we busy our event loop thus hanging our page.</p>
<p>That's where Web API come into the role. It takes this function from the event loop and deals with the server making the event loop free, so that we can execute the next function from the queue.</p>
<p>The next function in the queue is utiliseData() which goes in the loop, but because of no data available, it goes to waste and execution of the next function continues until the end of the queue. (This is called Async calling, i.e., we can do something else until we get data.)</p>
<p>Let us suppose our serverRequest() function had a return statement in code. When we get back data from the server Web API, it will push it in the queue at the end of queue.</p>
<p>As it gets pushed at the end of the queue, we cannot utilise its data as there isn't any function left in our queue to utilise this data. <strong>Thus it is not possible to return something from the async call.</strong></p>
<p>Thus the <em>solution</em> to this is <em>callback</em> or <em>promise</em>.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>We give our function (function utilising data returned from the server) to a function calling the server.</p>

<h2>If the underlying function is not promisified</h2>
<p>Step 1. Wrap the function with a callback into the nsynjs-aware wrapper (if it has a promisified version, you can skip this step):</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> ajaxGet = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">ctx,url</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> res = {};
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> ex;
    $.<span class="hljs-title function_">ajax</span>(url)
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">done</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">data</span>) {
        res.<span class="hljs-property">data</span> = data;
    })
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">fail</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">e</span>) {
        ex = e;
    })
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">always</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
        ctx.<span class="hljs-title function_">resume</span>(ex);
    });
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> res;
};
ajaxGet.<span class="hljs-property">nsynjsHasCallback</span> = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>Step 2. Put synchronous logic into function:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">process</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'got data:'</span>, <span class="hljs-title function_">ajaxGet</span>(nsynjsCtx, <span class="hljs-string">"data/file1.json"</span>).<span class="hljs-property">data</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Step 3. Run function in synchronous manner via nsynjs:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">nsynjs.<span class="hljs-title function_">run</span>(process,<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>,<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"synchronous function finished"</span>);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Nsynjs will evaluate all operators and expressions step-by-step, pausing execution in case if the result of some slow function is not ready.</p>

<p>We find ourselves in a universe which appears to progress along a dimension we call "time". We don't really understand what time is, but we have developed abstractions and vocabulary that let us reason and talk about it: "past", "present", "future", "before", "after".</p>
<p>The computer systems we build--more and more--have time as an important dimension. Certain things are set up to happen in the future. Then other things need to happen after those first things eventually occur. This is the basic notion called "asynchronicity". In our increasingly networked world, the most common case of asynchronicity is waiting for some remote system to respond to some request.</p>
<p>Consider an example. You call the milkman and order some milk. When it comes, you want to put it in your coffee. You can't put the milk in your coffee right now, because it is not here yet. You have to wait for it to come before putting it in your coffee. In other words, the following won't work:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> milk = <span class="hljs-title function_">order_milk</span>();
<span class="hljs-title function_">put_in_coffee</span>(milk);
</code></pre>
<p>Because JavaScript has no way to know that it needs to <strong>wait</strong> for <code>order_milk</code> to finish before it executes <code>put_in_coffee</code>. In other words, it does not know that <code>order_milk</code> is <strong>asynchronous</strong>--is something that is not going to result in milk until some future time. JavaScript, and other declarative languages execute one statement after another without waiting.</p>
<p>The classic JavaScript approach to this problem, taking advantage of the fact that JavaScript supports functions as first-class objects which can be passed around, is to pass a function as a parameter to the asynchronous request, which it will then invoke when it has completed its task sometime in the future. That is the "callback" approach. It looks like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">order_milk</span>(put_in_coffee);
</code></pre>
<p><code>order_milk</code> kicks off, orders the milk, then, when and only when it arrives, it invokes <code>put_in_coffee</code>.</p>
<p>The problem with this callback approach is that it pollutes the normal semantics of a function reporting its result with <code>return</code>; instead, functions must not reports their results by calling a callback given as a parameter. Also, this approach can rapidly become unwieldy when dealing with longer sequences of events. For example, let's say that I want to wait for the milk to be put in the coffee, and then and only then perform a third step, namely drinking the coffee. I end up needing to write something like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">order_milk</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">milk</span>) { <span class="hljs-title function_">put_in_coffee</span>(milk, drink_coffee); }
</code></pre>
<p>where I am passing to <code>put_in_coffee</code> both the milk to put in it, and also the action (<code>drink_coffee</code>) to execute once the milk has been put in. Such code becomes hard to write, and read, and debug.</p>
<p>In this case, we could rewrite the code in the question as:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> answer;
$.<span class="hljs-title function_">ajax</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'/foo.json'</span>) . <span class="hljs-title function_">done</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">response</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-title function_">callback</span>(response.<span class="hljs-property">data</span>);
});

<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">callback</span>(<span class="hljs-params">data</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(data);
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Enter promises</h3>
<p>This was the motivation for the notion of a "promise", which is a particular type of value which represents a <strong>future</strong> or <strong>asynchronous</strong> outcome of some sort. It can represent something that already happened, or that is going to happen in the future, or might never happen at all. Promises have a single method, named <code>then</code>, to which you pass an action to be executed when the outcome the promise represents has been realized.</p>
<p>In the case of our milk and coffee, we design <code>order_milk</code> to return a promise for the milk arriving, then specify <code>put_in_coffee</code> as a <code>then</code> action, as follows:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">order_milk</span>() . <span class="hljs-title function_">then</span>(put_in_coffee)
</code></pre>
<p>One advantage of this is that we can string these together to create sequences of future occurrences ("chaining"):</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">order_milk</span>() . <span class="hljs-title function_">then</span>(put_in_coffee) . <span class="hljs-title function_">then</span>(drink_coffee)
</code></pre>
<p>Let's apply promises to your particular problem. We will wrap our request logic inside a function, which returns a promise:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">get_data</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> $.<span class="hljs-title function_">ajax</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'/foo.json'</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Actually, all we've done is added a <code>return</code> to the call to <code>$.ajax</code>. This works because jQuery's <code>$.ajax</code> already returns a kind of promise-like thing. (In practice, without getting into details, we would prefer to wrap this call so as for return a real promise, or use some alternative to <code>$.ajax</code> that does so.) Now, if we want to load the file and wait for it to finish and then do something, we can simply say</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">get_data</span>() . <span class="hljs-title function_">then</span>(do_something)
</code></pre>
<p>for instance,</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">get_data</span>() .
  <span class="hljs-title function_">then</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">data</span>) { <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(data); });
</code></pre>
<p>When using promises, we end up passing lots of functions into <code>then</code>, so it's often helpful to use the more compact ES6-style arrow functions:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">get_data</span>() .
  <span class="hljs-title function_">then</span>(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">data</span> =&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(data));
</code></pre>
<h3>The <code>async</code> keyword</h3>
<p>But there's still something vaguely dissatisfying about having to write code one way if synchronous and a quite different way if asynchronous. For synchronous, we write</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">a</span>();
<span class="hljs-title function_">b</span>();
</code></pre>
<p>but if <code>a</code> is asynchronous, with promises we have to write</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">a</span>() . <span class="hljs-title function_">then</span>(b);
</code></pre>
<p>Above, we said, "JavaScript has no way to know that it needs to <strong>wait</strong> for the first call to finish before it executes the second". Wouldn't it be nice if there <strong>was</strong> some way to tell JavaScript that? It turns out that there is--the <code>await</code> keyword, used inside a special type of function called an "async" function. This feature is part of the upcoming version of ECMAScript (ES), but it is already available in transpilers such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babel_(transcompiler)" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Babel</a> given the right presets. This allows us to simply write</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">morning_routine</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> milk   = <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">order_milk</span>();
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> coffee = <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">put_in_coffee</span>(milk);
  <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">drink</span>(coffee);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In your case, you would be able to write something like</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
  data = <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">get_data</span>();
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(data);
}

<p><strong>Short answer</strong>: Your <code>foo()</code> method returns immediately, while the <code>$ajax()</code> call executes asynchronously <em>after the function returns</em>. The problem is then how or where to store the results retrieved by the async call once it returns.</p>

<p>Several solutions have been given in this thread. Perhaps the easiest way is to pass an object to the <code>foo()</code> method, and to store the results in a member of that object after the async call completes.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params">result</span>) {

<p>Note that the call to <code>foo()</code> will still return nothing useful. However, the result of the async call will now be stored in <code>result.response</code>.</p>

<p><em>Whoops!</em> The output of the line
<code>console.log('Finally, the result: ' + result);</code>
which I thought would be printed <em>last</em>, is actually printed <em>before</em> the
other output!  And it doesn't contain the result: it just prints <code>undefined</code>.
<sup>1</sup>
How come?</p>
<p><strong>A helpful insight</strong></p>
<p>I distinctly remember my first <em>aha!</em> moment on how to understand asynchronous
calls.<br>
It was <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/44298196#comment75602602_44298196">this comment</a> saying:<br>
<em>you actually don't want to get the data <strong>out</strong> of a callback;<br>
you want to get your data-needing action <strong>into</strong> the callback!</em>
<sup>2</sup><br>
This is obvious in the example above.<br>
But is it still possible to write code <em>after</em> the asynchronous call that
deals with the response once it has completed?</p>
<h3>2. Plain JavaScript and a callback function</h3>
<p>The answer is <em>yes!</em>  It is possible.<br>
One alternative is the use of a <em>callback</em> function in a continuation-passing
style:

<p>Note how the function <code>asynchronousCall</code> is <code>void</code>. It returns nothing.
Instead, by calling <code>asynchronousCall</code> with an anonymous callback function
(<code>asynchronousCall(function (result) {...</code>), this function executes the
desired actions on the result, but only <em>after</em> the request has completed 
when the <code>responseText</code> is available.</p>
<p>Running the above snippet shows how I will probably not want to write any code
<em>after</em> the asyncronous call (such as the line
<code>LAST in the code, but executed FIRST!</code>).<br>
<em>Why?</em>  Because such code will
happen <em>before</em> the asyncronous call delivers any response data.<br>
Doing so is bound to cause confusion when comparing the <em>code</em> with the <em>output</em>.</p>
<h3>3. Promise with <code>.then()</code>  or <code>async</code>/<code>await</code></h3>
<p>The <code>.then()</code> construct was introduced in the <em>ECMA-262 6th Edition in June
2015</em>, and the <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> construct was introduced in the <em>ECMA-262
8th Edition in June 2017</em>.<br>
The code below is still plain JavaScript, replacing the old-school
<em>XMLHttpRequest</em> with <em>Fetch</em>.

<p>A word of warning is warranted if you decide to go with the <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>
construct. Note in the above snippet how <code>await</code> is needed in <em>two</em> places.
If forgotten in the first place, there will be no output. If forgotten in the
second place, the only output will be the empty object, <code>{}</code>
(or <code>[object Object]</code> or <code>[object Promise]</code>).<br>
Forgetting the <code>async</code> prefix of the function is maybe the worst of all  the
output will be <code>"SyntaxError: missing ) in parenthetical"</code>  no mentioning of
the <em>missing</em> <code>async</code> keyword.</p>
<h3>4. Promise.all  array of URLs <sup>5</sup></h3>
<p>Suppose we need to request a whole bunch of URLs.
I could send one request, wait till it responds, then send the next request,
wait till <em>it</em> responds, and so on ...<br>
Aargh!  That could take a loong time. Wouldn't it be better if I could send
them <em>all</em> at once, and then wait no longer than it takes for the slowest
response to arrive?</p>
<p>As a simplified example, I will use:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">urls = [<span class="hljs-string">'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/2'</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/3'</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>The JSONs of the two URLs:</p>
<pre class="lang-json s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-json"><span class="hljs-punctuation">{</span><span class="hljs-attr">"userId"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span><span class="hljs-attr">"id"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span><span class="hljs-number">2</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span><span class="hljs-attr">"title"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span><span class="hljs-string">"quis ut nam facilis et officia qui"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span>
 <span class="hljs-attr">"completed"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span><span class="hljs-keyword">false</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">}</span>
<span class="hljs-punctuation">{</span><span class="hljs-attr">"userId"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span><span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span><span class="hljs-attr">"id"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span><span class="hljs-number">3</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span><span class="hljs-attr">"title"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span><span class="hljs-string">"fugiat veniam minus"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">,</span><span class="hljs-attr">"completed"</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">:</span><span class="hljs-keyword">false</span><span class="hljs-punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The goal is to get an array of objects, where each object contains the <code>title</code>
value from the corresponding URL.</p>
<p>To make it a little more interesting, I will assume that there is already an
array of <em>names</em> that I want the array of URL results (the <em>titles</em>) to be
merged with:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">namesonly = [<span class="hljs-string">'two'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'three'</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>The desired output is a mashup combining <code>namesonly</code> and <code>urls</code> into an
<em>array of objects</em>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">[{<span class="hljs-string">"name"</span>:<span class="hljs-string">"two"</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"loremipsum"</span>:<span class="hljs-string">"quis ut nam facilis et officia qui"</span>},
{<span class="hljs-string">"name"</span>:<span class="hljs-string">"three"</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"loremipsum"</span>:<span class="hljs-string">"fugiat veniam minus"</span>}]
</code></pre>
<p>where I have changed the name of <code>title</code> to <code>loremipsum</code>.</p>

<p>All the above examples are short and succinctly convey how asynchronous calls
may be used on toyish APIs.
Using small APIs works well to explain concepts and working code, but the
examples might be a bit of dry runs.</p>

combined to create a more interesting output.</p>

<p><strong>The code to create and visualize the mashup</strong></p>
<p>The overall task is to use Postman to visualize all the album titles and front
covers of a music band.
How to write code to achieve this has already been described in quite some
detail in  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/67824483">an answer</a> to the question
<em>How can I visualize an API mashup in Postman?</em>  Therefore I will avoid
lengthy discussions here and just present the code and a screenshot of the
result:</p>

<p><br><strong>How to download and run the Postman Collection</strong></p>
<p>Running the Postman Collection should be straightforward.<br>
Assuming you are using <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/" rel="noreferrer">the desktop version of Postman</a>, do as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Download and save<br>
<a href="http://henke.atwebpages.com/postman/mbid/MusicBands.pm_coll.json" rel="noreferrer">http://henke.atwebpages.com/postman/mbid/MusicBands.pm_coll.json</a><br>
in a suitable place on your hard drive.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In Postman, <em><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd> &gt; Upload Files &gt;
<code>MusicBands.pm_coll.json</code> &gt; Import</em>.<br>
You should now see <code>MusicBands</code> among your collections in Postman.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em>Collections &gt; <code>MusicBands</code> &gt; <code>DummyRequest</code> &gt; <strong>Send</strong></em>.
<sup>8</sup></p>
</li>
<li><p>In the Postman Response Body, click <em>Visualize</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You should now be able to scroll 15 albums as indicated by the
screenshot above.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> Expressed by the original poster as: <em>they all return
<code>undefined</code></em>.<br>
<sup>2</sup> If you think asynchronous calls are confusing, consider having a
look at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/67662000">some questions and answers about asynchronous calls</a> to see if that helps.<br>
<sup>3</sup> The name <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> is as misleading as the <em>X</em> in
<em>AJAX</em>  these days the data format of Web APIs is ubiquitously JSON, not XML.<br>
<sup>4</sup> <a href="https://github.github.io/fetch/" rel="noreferrer">Fetch</a>
returns a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise" rel="noreferrer">Promise</a>.
I was surprised to learn that neither <em>XMLHttpRequest</em> nor <em>Fetch</em> are part of
the <em>ECMAScript</em> standard.
The reason JavaScript can access them here is because the web browser provides
them.
<a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/" rel="noreferrer">The Fetch Standard</a> and
<a href="https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/" rel="noreferrer">the XMLHttpRequest Standard</a> are both upheld by
<a href="https://whatwg.org/news/start" rel="noreferrer">the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)</a> that was formed in June 2004.<br>

<h1>But wait...!</h1>
<p>There is a problem with using promises!</p>
<h2>Why should we use our own custom Promise?</h2>
<p>I was using this solution for a while until I figured out there is an error in old browsers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Uncaught ReferenceError: Promise is not defined</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I decided to implement my own Promise class for <strong>ES3 to below</strong> JavaScript compilers if it's not defined. Just add this code before your main code and then safely use Promise!</p>

<p>Of course there are many approaches like synchronous request, promise, but from my experience I think you should use the callback approach. It's natural to asynchronous behavior of JavaScript.</p>
<p>So, your code snippet can be rewritten to be a little different:</p>

<p>The question was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do I return the response from an asynchronous call?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which <em>can</em> be interpreted as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How to make <strong>asynchronous</strong> code look <strong>synchronous</strong>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The solution will be to avoid callbacks, and use a combination of <strong>Promises</strong> and <strong>async/await</strong>.</p>
<p>I would like to give an example for an Ajax request.</p>
<p>(Although it can be written in JavaScript, I prefer to write it in Python, and compile it to JavaScript using <a href="https://github.com/QQuick/Transcrypt" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Transcrypt</a>. It will be clear enough.)</p>
<p>Lets first enable jQuery usage, to have <code>$</code> available as <code>S</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">__pragma__ (<span class="hljs-string">'alias'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'S'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'$'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Define a function which returns a <strong>Promise</strong>, in this case an Ajax call:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">def <span class="hljs-title function_">read</span>(<span class="hljs-attr">url</span>: str):
    deferred = S.<span class="hljs-title class_">Deferred</span>()
    S.<span class="hljs-title function_">ajax</span>({<span class="hljs-string">'type'</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"POST"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'url'</span>: url, <span class="hljs-string">'data'</span>: { },
        <span class="hljs-string">'success'</span>: lambda <span class="hljs-attr">d</span>: deferred.<span class="hljs-title function_">resolve</span>(d),
        <span class="hljs-string">'error'</span>: lambda <span class="hljs-attr">e</span>: deferred.<span class="hljs-title function_">reject</span>(e)
    })
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> deferred.<span class="hljs-title function_">promise</span>()
</code></pre>
<p>Use the <strong>asynchronous</strong> code as if it were <strong>synchronous</strong>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> def <span class="hljs-title function_">readALot</span>():
    <span class="hljs-attr">try</span>:
        result1 = <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">read</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"url_1"</span>)
        result2 = <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">read</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"url_2"</span>)
    except <span class="hljs-title class_">Exception</span>:

<p>Rather than throwing code at you, there are two concepts that are key to understanding how JavaScript handles callbacks and asynchronicity (is that even a word?)</p>
<h2><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop" rel="nofollow noreferrer">The Event Loop and Concurrency Model</a></strong></h2>
<p>There are three things you need to be aware of; <strong>The queue; <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop#Event_loop" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the event loop</a> and the stack</strong></p>
<p>In broad, simplistic terms, the event loop is like the project manager, it is constantly listening for any functions that want to run and communicates between the queue and the stack.</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> (queue.<span class="hljs-title function_">waitForMessage</span>()) {
  queue.<span class="hljs-title function_">processNextMessage</span>();
}
</code></pre>
<p>Once it receives a message to run something it adds it to the queue. The queue is the list of things that are waiting to execute (like your AJAX request). imagine it like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>call foo.com/api/bar using foobarFunc</li>
<li>Go perform an infinite loop
... and so on</li>
</ol>
<p>When one of these messages is going to execute it pops the message from the queue and creates a stack, the stack is everything JavaScript needs to execute to perform the instruction in the message. So in our example it's being told to call <code>foobarFunc</code></p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foobarFunc</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-title function_">anotherFunction</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span>));
}
</code></pre>
<p>So anything that foobarFunc needs to execute (in our case <code>anotherFunction</code>) will get pushed onto the stack. executed, and then forgotten about - the event loop will then move onto the next thing in the queue (or listen for messages)</p>
<p><strong>The key thing here is the order of execution. That is</strong></p>
<h2><strong>WHEN is something going to run</strong></h2>
<p>When you make a call using AJAX to an external party or run any asynchronous code (a setTimeout for example), JavaScript is dependant upon a response before it can proceed.</p>
<p>The big question is when will it get the response? The answer is we don't know - so the event loop is waiting for that message to say "hey run me". If JavaScript just waited around for that message synchronously your app would freeze and it will suck. So JavaScript carries on executing the next item in the queue whilst waiting for the message to get added back to the queue.</p>
<p>That's why with asynchronous functionality we use things called <strong>callbacks</strong>. - A function or handler that, when passed into another function, will be executed at a later date. A <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise" rel="nofollow noreferrer">promise</a> uses callbacks (functions passed to <code>.then()</code> for example) as a way to reason about this asynchronous behaviour in a more linear way. The promise is a way of saying "I <em>promise to return something at some point</em>" and the callback is how we handle that value that is eventually returned. jQuery uses specific callbacks called <code>deffered.done</code> <code>deffered.fail</code> and <code>deffered.always</code> (amongst others). You can see them all <a href="https://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a></p>
<p>So what you need to do is pass a function that is promised to execute at some point with data that is passed to it.</p>
<p>Because a callback is not executed immediately but at a later time it's important to pass the reference to the function not it executed. so</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params">bla</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(bla)
}
</code></pre>
<p>so most of the time (but not always) you'll pass <code>foo</code> not <code>foo()</code></p>
<p>Hopefully that will make some sense. When you encounter things like this that seem confusing - i highly recommend reading the documentation fully to at least get an understanding of it. It will make you a much better developer.</p>

You can attach \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;then\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; handlers to promises to extract their value and handle errors. \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;then\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; handlers allow \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22539815/arent-promises-just-callbacks\u0026quot;\u0026gt;chaining\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; of calls.

While this is interesting on its own and opens room for a lot of possibility, there is one particular interesting case.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If the sequence we\u0026apos;re producing is a sequence of actions rather than numbers - we can pause the function whenever an action is yielded and wait for it before we resume the function. So instead of a sequence of numbers, we need a sequence of \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;future\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; values - that is: promises.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This somewhat a tricky, but very powerful trick lets us write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner.

The event queue is where all your functions are pushed on some event (example: click).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This is one by one carried out of queue and put into the event loop which executes this function and prepares itself for the next one after the first one is executed. This means execution of one function doesn\u0026apos;t start until the function before it in the queue is executed in the event loop.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now let us think we pushed two functions in a queue. One is for getting a data from the server and another utilises that data. We pushed the serverRequest() function in the queue first and then the utiliseData() function. The serverRequest function goes in the event loop and makes a call to server as we never know how much time it will take to get data from server, so this process is expected to take time and so we busy our event loop thus hanging our page.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;That\u0026apos;s where Web API come into the role. It takes this function from the event loop and deals with the server making the event loop free, so that we can execute the next function from the queue.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The next function in the queue is utiliseData() which goes in the loop, but because of no data available, it goes to waste and execution of the next function continues until the end of the queue. (This is called Async calling, i.e., we can do something else until we get data.)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Let us suppose our serverRequest() function had a return statement in code. When we get back data from the server Web API, it will push it in the queue at the end of queue.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;As it gets pushed at the end of the queue, we cannot utilise its data as there isn\u0026apos;t any function left in our queue to utilise this data. \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Thus it is not possible to return something from the async call.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Thus the \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;solution\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;

We don\u0026apos;t really understand what time is, but we have developed abstractions and vocabulary that let us reason and talk about it: \u0026quot;past\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;present\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;future\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;before\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;after\u0026quot;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The computer systems we build--more and more--have time as an important dimension.

In our increasingly networked world, the most common case of asynchronicity is waiting for some remote system to respond to some request.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Consider an example. You call the milkman and order some milk. When it comes, you want to put it in your coffee. You can\u0026apos;t put the milk in your coffee right now, because it is not here yet. You have to wait for it to come before putting it in your coffee.

In other words, it does not know that \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;order_milk\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;asynchronous\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;--is something that is not going to result in milk until some future time. JavaScript, and other declarative languages execute one statement after another without waiting.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The classic JavaScript approach to this problem, taking advantage of the fact that JavaScript supports functions as first-class objects which can be passed around, is to pass a function as a parameter to the asynchronous request, which it will then invoke when it has completed its task sometime in the future. That is the \u0026quot;callback\u0026quot; approach. It looks like this:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-js s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;order_milk\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(put_in_coffee);\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;order_milk\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; kicks off, orders the milk, then, when and only when it arrives, it invokes \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;put_in_coffee\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The problem with this callback approach is that it pollutes the normal semantics of a function reporting its result with \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;return\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;; instead, functions must not reports their results by calling a callback given as a parameter. Also, this approach can rapidly become unwieldy when dealing with longer sequences of events. For example, let\u0026apos;s say that I want to wait for the milk to be put in the coffee, and then and only then perform a third step, namely drinking the coffee. I end up needing to write something like this:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-js s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;order_milk\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;function\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-params\u0026quot;\u0026gt;milk\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;) { \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;put_in_coffee\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(milk, drink_coffee); }\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;where I am passing to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;put_in_coffee\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; both the milk to put in it, and also the action (\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;drink_coffee\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;) to execute once the milk has been put in.

The queue is the list of things that are waiting to execute (like your AJAX request). imagine it like this:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ol\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;call foo.com/api/bar using foobarFunc\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Go perform an infinite loop\n... and so on\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ol\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When one of these messages is going to execute it pops the message from the queue and creates a stack, the stack is everything JavaScript needs to execute to perform the instruction in the message. So in our example it\u0026apos;s being told to call \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;foobarFunc\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-js s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;function\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;foobarFunc\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; (\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;var\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;) {\n  \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-variable language_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;console\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;log\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;anotherFunction\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;var\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;));\n}\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So anything that foobarFunc needs to execute (in our case \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;anotherFunction\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;) will get pushed onto the stack. executed, and then forgotten about - the event loop will then move onto the next thing in the queue (or listen for messages)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;The key thing here is the order of execution. That is\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;WHEN is something going to run\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When you make a call using AJAX to an external party or run any asynchronous code (a setTimeout for example), JavaScript is dependant upon a response before it can proceed.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The big question is when will it get the response? The answer is we don\u0026apos;t know - so the event loop is waiting for that message to say \u0026quot;hey run me\u0026quot;. If JavaScript just waited around for that message synchronously your app would freeze and it will suck. So JavaScript carries on executing the next item in the queue whilst waiting for the message to get added back to the queue.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;That\u0026apos;s why with asynchronous functionality we use things called \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;callbacks\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;. - A function or handler that, when passed into another function, will be executed at a later date. A \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;nofollow noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;promise\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; uses callbacks (functions passed to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;.then()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; for example) as a way to reason about this asynchronous behaviour in a more linear way. The promise is a way of saying \u0026quot;I \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;promise to return something at some point\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026quot; and the callback is how we handle that value that is eventually returned. jQuery uses specific callbacks called \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;deffered.done\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;deffered.fail\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;deffered.always\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; (amongst others).
