Periods, colons and &apos;#&apos; have special meaning in CSS selectors, so you will have to escape those characters using a backslash in CSS or a double backslash in a selector string passed to jQuery. Think about how often you will have to escape a character in your stylesheets or code before you go crazy with periods and colons in ids.\n\nFor example, the HTML declaration &lt;div id=&quot;first.name&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; is valid. You can select that element in CSS as #first\\.name and in jQuery like so: $(&apos;#first\\\\.name&apos;). But if you forget the backslash, $(&apos;#first.name&apos;), you will have a perfectly valid selector looking for an element with id first and also having class name. This is a bug that is easy to overlook. You might be happier in the long run choosing the id first-name (a hyphen rather than a period), instead.\n\nYou can simplify your development tasks by strictly sticking to a naming convention. For example, if you limit yourself entirely to lower-case characters and always separate words with either hyphens or underscores (but not both, pick one and never use the other), then you have an easy-to-remember pattern. You will never wonder &quot;was it firstName or FirstName?&quot; because you will always know that you should type first_name. Prefer camel case? Then limit yourself to that, no hyphens or underscores, and always, consistently use either upper-case or lower-case for the first character, don&apos;t mix them.\n\n\n\nA now very obscure problem was that at least one browser, Netscape 6, incorrectly treated id attribute values as case-sensitive. That meant that if you had typed id=&quot;firstName&quot; in your HTML (lower-case &apos;f&apos;) and #FirstName { color: red } in your CSS (upper-case &apos;F&apos;), that buggy browser would have failed to set the element&apos;s color to red. At the time of this edit, April 2015, I hope you aren&apos;t being asked to support Netscape 6. Consider this a historical footnote.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"From the HTML 4 specification:\n\n\n  ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens (&quot;-&quot;), underscores (&quot;_&quot;), colons (&quot;:&quot;), and periods (&quot;.&quot;).\n\n\nA common mistake is to use an ID that starts with a digit.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You can technically use colons and periods in id/name attributes, but I would strongly suggest avoiding both.\n\nIn CSS (and several JavaScript libraries like jQuery), both the period and the colon have special meaning and you will run into problems if you&apos;re not careful. Periods are class selectors and colons are pseudo-selectors (eg., &quot;:hover&quot; for an element when the mouse is over it).\n\nIf you give an element the id &quot;my.cool:thing&quot;, your CSS selector will look like this:\n\n#my.cool:thing { ... /* some rules */ ... }\n\n\nWhich is really saying, &quot;the element with an id of &apos;my&apos;, a class of &apos;cool&apos; and the &apos;thing&apos; pseudo-selector&quot; in CSS-speak.\n\nStick to A-Z of any case, numbers, underscores and hyphens. And as said above, make sure your ids are unique.\n\nThat should be your first concern.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"jQuery does handle any valid ID name. You just need to escape metacharacters (i.e., dots, semicolons, square brackets...). It&apos;s like saying that JavaScript has a problem with quotes only because you can&apos;t write\n\nvar name = &apos;O&apos;Hara&apos;;\n\n\nSelectors in jQuery API (see bottom note)\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"HTML5: Permitted Values for ID &amp; Class Attributes\n\nAs of HTML5, the only restrictions on the value of an ID are:\n\n\nmust be unique in the document\nmust not contain any space characters\nmust contain at least one character\n\n\nSimilar rules apply to classes (except for the uniqueness, of course).\n\nSo the value can be all digits, just one digit, just punctuation characters, include special characters, whatever. Just no whitespace. This is very different from HTML4.\n\nIn HTML 4, ID values must begin with a letter, which can then be followed only by letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, colons and periods.\n\nIn HTML5 these are valid:\n\n&lt;div id=&quot;999&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;#%LV-||&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;____V&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;{}&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;©&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;¤~¥&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nJust bear in mind that using numbers, punctuation or special characters in the value of an ID may cause trouble in other contexts (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, regex).\n\nFor example, the following ID is valid in HTML5:\n\n&lt;div id=&quot;9lions&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nHowever, it is invalid in CSS:\n\nFrom the CSS2.1 spec:\n\n\n  4.1.3 Characters and case\n  \n  In CSS, identifiers (including element names, classes, and IDs in\n  selectors) can contain only the characters [a-zA-Z0-9] and ISO 10646\n  characters U+00A0 and higher, plus the hyphen (-) and the underscore\n  (_); they cannot start with a digit, two hyphens, or a hyphen\n  followed by a digit.\n\n\nIn most cases you may be able to escape characters in contexts where they have restrictions or special meaning.\n\n\n\nW3C References\n\nHTML5\n\n\n  3.2.5.1 The id\n  attribute\n  \n  The id attribute specifies its element&apos;s unique identifier (ID). \n  \n  The value must be unique amongst all the IDs in the element&apos;s home\n  subtree and must contain at least one character.

<p>For <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/types.html#type-id" rel="noreferrer">HTML 4</a>, the answer is technically:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods (".").</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#the-id-attribute" rel="noreferrer">HTML 5</a> is even more permissive, saying only that an id must contain at least one character and may not contain any space characters.</p>

<p>The id attribute is case sensitive in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/diffs.html#h-4.2" rel="noreferrer">XHTML</a>.</p>

<p>As a purely practical matter, you may want to avoid certain characters. Periods, colons and '#' have special meaning in CSS selectors, so you will have to escape those characters using a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/syndata.html#value-def-identifier" rel="noreferrer">backslash in CSS</a> or a double backslash in a <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/faq/how-do-i-select-an-element-by-an-id-that-has-characters-used-in-css-notation/" rel="noreferrer">selector string passed to jQuery</a>. Think about how often you will have to escape a character in your stylesheets or code before you go crazy with periods and colons in ids.</p>

<p>For example, the HTML declaration <code>&lt;div id="first.name"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> is valid. You can select that element in CSS as <code>#first\.name</code> and in jQuery like so: <code>$('#first\\.name').</code> But if you forget the backslash, <code>$('#first.name')</code>, you will have a perfectly valid selector looking for an element with id <code>first</code> and also having class <code>name</code>. This is a bug that is easy to overlook. You might be happier in the long run choosing the id <code>first-name</code> (a hyphen rather than a period), instead.</p>

<p>You can simplify your development tasks by strictly sticking to a naming convention. For example, if you limit yourself entirely to lower-case characters and always separate words with either hyphens or underscores (but not both, pick one and never use the other), then you have an easy-to-remember pattern. You will never wonder "was it <code>firstName</code> or <code>FirstName</code>?" because you will always know that you should type <code>first_name</code>. Prefer camel case? Then limit yourself to that, no hyphens or underscores, and always, consistently use either upper-case or lower-case for the first character, don't mix them.</p>

<hr>

<p>A now very obscure problem was that at least one browser, Netscape 6, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Case_Sensitivity_in_class_and_id_Names" rel="noreferrer">incorrectly treated id attribute values as case-sensitive</a>. That meant that if you had typed <code>id="firstName"</code> in your HTML (lower-case 'f') and <code>#FirstName { color: red }</code> in your CSS (upper-case 'F'), that buggy browser would have failed to set the element's color to red. At the time of this edit, April 2015, I hope you aren't being asked to support Netscape 6. Consider this a historical footnote.</p>

<p>You can technically use colons and periods in id/name attributes, but I would strongly suggest avoiding both.</p>

<p>In CSS (and several JavaScript libraries like jQuery), both the period and the colon have special meaning and you will run into problems if you're not careful. Periods are class selectors and colons are pseudo-selectors (eg., ":hover" for an element when the mouse is over it).</p>

<p>If you give an element the id "my.cool:thing", your CSS selector will look like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml">#my.cool:thing { ... /* some rules */ ... }
</code></pre>

<p>Which is really saying, "the element with an id of 'my', a class of 'cool' and the 'thing' pseudo-selector" in CSS-speak.</p>

<p>Stick to A-Z of any case, numbers, underscores and hyphens. And as said above, make sure your ids are unique.</p>

<p>That should be your first concern.</p>

<h2>HTML5: Permitted Values for ID &amp; Class Attributes</h2>

<p>As of HTML5, the only restrictions on the value of an ID are:</p>

<ol>
<li>must be unique in the document</li>
<li>must not contain any space characters</li>
<li>must contain at least one character</li>
</ol>

<p>Similar rules apply to classes (except for the uniqueness, of course).</p>

<p>So the value can be all digits, just one digit, just punctuation characters, include special characters, whatever. Just no whitespace. This is very different from HTML4.</p>

<p>In HTML 4, ID values must begin with a letter, which can then be followed only by letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, colons and periods.</p>

<p>In HTML5 these are valid:</p>

<pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"999"</span>&gt;</span> ... <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"#%LV-||"</span>&gt;</span> ... <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"____V"</span>&gt;</span> ... <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">""</span>&gt;</span> ... <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">""</span>&gt;</span> ... <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"{}"</span>&gt;</span> ... <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"©"</span>&gt;</span> ... <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"¤~¥"</span>&gt;</span> ... <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Just bear in mind that using numbers, punctuation or special characters in the value of an ID may cause trouble in other contexts (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, regex).</p>

<p>For example, the following ID is valid in HTML5:</p>

<pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"9lions"</span>&gt;</span> ... <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>However, it is invalid in CSS:</em></strong></p>

<p>From the CSS2.1 spec:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#characters" rel="noreferrer"><strong>4.1.3 Characters and case</strong></a></p>
  
  <p>In CSS, <em>identifiers</em> (including element names, classes, and IDs in
  selectors) can contain only the characters [a-zA-Z0-9] and ISO 10646
  characters U+00A0 and higher, plus the hyphen (-) and the underscore
  (_); <strong><em>they cannot start with a digit, two hyphens, or a hyphen
  followed by a digit</em></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In most cases you may be able to escape characters in contexts where they have restrictions or special meaning.</p>

<h2>Pre-HTML5:</h2>
<p>ID should match:</p>
<pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml">[A-Za-z][-A-Za-z0-9_:.]*
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Must <em>start</em> with A-Z or a-z characters</li>
<li>May contain <code>-</code> (hyphen), <code>_</code> (underscore), <code>:</code> (colon) and <code>.</code> (period)</li>
</ol>
<p>But one should avoid <code>:</code> and <code>.</code> because:</p>
<p>For example, an ID could be labelled "a.b:c" and referenced in the style sheet as #a.b:c, but as well as being the id for the element, it could mean id "a", class "b", pseudo-selector "c". It is best to avoid the confusion and stay away from using <code>.</code> and <code>:</code> altogether.</p>

<p>But even though you can make ID with colons (:) or period (<code>.</code>). It is hard for <strong>CSS</strong> to use these IDs as a selector. Mainly when you want to use pseudo elements (<code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code>).</p>
<p>Also in JavaScript it is hard to select these ID's.
So you should use first four ID's as the preferred way by many developers around and if it's necessary then you can use the last two also.</p>

<p>The id attribute specifies its element's unique identifier (ID).</p>
<p>There are no other restrictions on what form an ID can take; in particular, IDs can consist of just digits, start with a digit, start with an underscore, consist of just punctuation, etc.</p>
<p>An element's unique identifier can be used for a variety of purposes, most notably as a way to link to specific parts of a document using fragments, as a way to target an element when scripting, and as a way to style a specific element from CSS.</p>

Periods, colons and \u0026apos;#\u0026apos; have special meaning in CSS selectors, so you will have to escape those characters using a \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/syndata.html#value-def-identifier\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;backslash in CSS\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; or a double backslash in a \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/faq/how-do-i-select-an-element-by-an-id-that-has-characters-used-in-css-notation/\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;selector string passed to jQuery\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;. Think about how often you will have to escape a character in your stylesheets or code before you go crazy with periods and colons in ids.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;For example, the HTML declaration \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;\u0026amp;lt;div id=\u0026quot;first.name\u0026quot;\u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;lt;/div\u0026amp;gt;\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is valid. You can select that element in CSS as \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;#first\\.name\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and in jQuery like so: \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;$(\u0026apos;#first\\\\.name\u0026apos;).\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; But if you forget the backslash, \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;$(\u0026apos;#first.name\u0026apos;)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, you will have a perfectly valid selector looking for an element with id \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and also having class \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;name\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. This is a bug that is easy to overlook. You might be happier in the long run choosing the id \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;first-name\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; (a hyphen rather than a period), instead.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You can simplify your development tasks by strictly sticking to a naming convention. For example, if you limit yourself entirely to lower-case characters and always separate words with either hyphens or underscores (but not both, pick one and never use the other), then you have an easy-to-remember pattern. You will never wonder \u0026quot;was it \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;firstName\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;FirstName\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;?\u0026quot; because you will always know that you should type \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;first_name\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. Prefer camel case? Then limit yourself to that, no hyphens or underscores, and always, consistently use either upper-case or lower-case for the first character, don\u0026apos;t mix them.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A now very obscure problem was that at least one browser, Netscape 6, \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Case_Sensitivity_in_class_and_id_Names\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;incorrectly treated id attribute values as case-sensitive\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.
