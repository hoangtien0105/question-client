Python decided to do methods in a way that makes the instance to which the method belongs be passed automatically, but not received automatically: the first parameter of methods is the instance the method is called on. That makes methods entirely the same as functions, and leaves the actual name to use up to you (although self is the convention, and people will generally frown at you when you use something else.) self is not special to the code, it&apos;s just another object.\n\nPython could have done something else to distinguish normal names from attributes -- special syntax like Ruby has, or requiring declarations like C++ and Java do, or perhaps something  yet more different -- but it didn&apos;t. Python&apos;s all for making things explicit, making it obvious what&apos;s what, and although it doesn&apos;t do it entirely everywhere, it does do it for instance attributes. That&apos;s why assigning to an instance attribute needs to know what instance to assign to, and that&apos;s why it needs self..\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Let&apos;s say you have a class ClassA which contains a method methodA defined as:\n\ndef methodA(self, arg1, arg2):\n    # do something\n\n\nand ObjectA is an instance of this class.\n\nNow when ObjectA.methodA(arg1, arg2) is called, python internally converts it for you as:\n\nClassA.methodA(ObjectA, arg1, arg2)\n\n\nThe self variable refers to the object itself.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Lets take a simple vector class:\n\nclass Vector:\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\n\nWe want to have a method which calculates the length. What would it look like if we wanted to define it inside the class?\n\n    def length(self):\n        return math.sqrt(self.x ** 2 + self.y ** 2)\n\n\nWhat should it look like when we were to define it as a global method/function?\n\ndef length_global(vector):\n    return math.sqrt(vector.x ** 2 + vector.y ** 2)\n\n\nSo the whole structure stays the same. How can me make use of this? If we assume for a moment that we hadnt written a length method for our Vector class, we could do this:\n\nVector.length_new = length_global\nv = Vector(3, 4)\nprint(v.length_new()) # 5.0\n\n\nThis works because the first parameter of length_global, can be re-used as the self parameter in length_new. This would not be possible without an explicit self.\n\n\n\nAnother way of understanding the need for the explicit self is to see where Python adds some syntactical sugar. When you keep in mind, that basically, a call like\n\nv_instance.length()\n\n\nis internally transformed to\n\nVector.length(v_instance)\n\n\nit is easy to see where the self fits in.

Without passing it&apos;s own name into the self parameter, the attributes and methods in the class would remain as a general template and would not be referenced to (belong to) the object.

<p>The reason you need to use <code>self.</code> is because Python does not use the <code>@</code> syntax to refer to instance attributes. Python decided to do methods in a way that makes the instance to which the method belongs be <em>passed</em> automatically, but not <em>received</em> automatically: the first parameter of methods is the instance the method is called on. That makes methods entirely the same as functions, and leaves the actual name to use up to you (although <code>self</code> is the convention, and people will generally frown at you when you use something else.) <code>self</code> is not special to the code, it's just another object.</p>

<p>Python could have done something else to distinguish normal names from attributes -- special syntax like Ruby has, or requiring declarations like C++ and Java do, or perhaps something  yet more different -- but it didn't. Python's all for making things explicit, making it obvious what's what, and although it doesn't do it entirely everywhere, it does do it for instance attributes. That's why assigning to an instance attribute needs to know what instance to assign to, and that's why it needs <code>self.</code>.</p>

<p>Let's say you have a class <code>ClassA</code> which contains a method <code>methodA</code> defined as:</p>

    <span class="hljs-comment"># do something</span>
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>ObjectA</code> is an instance of this class.</p>

<p>Now when <code>ObjectA.methodA(arg1, arg2)</code> is called, python internally converts it for you as:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">ClassA.methodA(ObjectA, arg1, arg2)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>self</code> variable refers to the object itself.</p>

<p>Lets take a simple vector class:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Vector</span>:
    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">__init__</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self, x, y</span>):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
</code></pre>

<p>We want to have a method which calculates the length. What would it look like if we wanted to define it inside the class?</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">length</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self</span>):
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> math.sqrt(self.x ** <span class="hljs-number">2</span> + self.y ** <span class="hljs-number">2</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>What should it look like when we were to define it as a global method/function?</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">length_global</span>(<span class="hljs-params">vector</span>):
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> math.sqrt(vector.x ** <span class="hljs-number">2</span> + vector.y ** <span class="hljs-number">2</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>So the whole structure stays the same. How can me make use of this? If we assume for a moment that we hadnt written a <code>length</code> method for our <code>Vector</code> class, we could do this:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">Vector.length_new = length_global
v = Vector(<span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">4</span>)
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(v.length_new()) <span class="hljs-comment"># 5.0</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This works because the first parameter of <code>length_global</code>, can be re-used as the <code>self</code> parameter in <code>length_new</code>. This would not be possible without an explicit <code>self</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Another way of understanding the need for the explicit <code>self</code> is to see where Python adds some syntactical sugar. When you keep in mind, that basically, a call like</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">v_instance.length()
</code></pre>

<p>is internally transformed to</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">Vector.length(v_instance)
</code></pre>

<p>it is easy to see where the <code>self</code> fits in. You don't actually write instance methods in Python; what you write is class methods which must take an instance as a first parameter. And therefore, youll have to place the instance parameter somewhere explicitly.</p>

<p>When objects are instantiated, the object itself is passed into the self parameter. </p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/whCZm.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>Because of this, the objects data is bound to the object. Below is an example of how you might like to visualize what each objects data might look. Notice how self is replaced with the objects name. I'm not saying this example diagram below is wholly accurate but it hopefully with serve a purpose in visualizing the use of self. </p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5daR6.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>The Object is passed into the self parameter so that the object can keep hold of its own data.</p>

<p>Although this may not be wholly accurate, think of the process of instantiating an object like this: When an object is made it uses the class as a template for its own data and methods. Without passing it's own name into the self parameter, the attributes and methods in the class would remain as a general template and would not be referenced to (belong to) the object. So by passing the object's name into the self parameter it means that if 100 objects are instantiated from the one class, they can all keep track of their own data and methods.</p>

<p>I will demonstrate with code that <strong>does not use classes</strong>:</p>

<p>The following excerpts are from the <a href="http://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html" rel="noreferrer">Python documentation about self</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As in Modula-3, there are no shorthands [in Python] for referencing the objects members from its methods: the method function is declared with an explicit first argument representing the object, which is provided implicitly by the call.</p>
<p>Often, the first argument of a method is called self. This is nothing more than a convention: the name self has absolutely no special meaning to Python. Note, however, that by not following the convention your code may be less readable to other Python programmers, and it is also conceivable that a class browser program might be written that relies upon such a convention.</p>

<p>Python is not a language built for Object Oriented Programming unlike Java or C++. </p>

<p>When calling a static method in Python, one simply writes a method with regular arguments inside it. </p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Animal</span>():
    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">staticMethod</span>():
        <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> <span class="hljs-string">"This is a static method"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>However, an object method, which requires you to make a variable, which is an Animal, in this case, needs the self argument</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Animal</span>():
    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">objectMethod</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self</span>):
        <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> <span class="hljs-string">"This is an object method which needs an instance of a class"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The self method is also used to refer to a variable field within the class. </p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Animal</span>():
    <span class="hljs-comment">#animalName made in constructor</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">Animal</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self</span>):
        self.animalName = <span class="hljs-string">""</span>;


    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">getAnimalName</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self</span>):
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> self.animalName
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, self is referring to the animalName variable of the entire class. REMEMBER: If you have a variable within a method, self will not work. That variable is simply existent only while that method is running. For defining fields (the variables of the entire class), you have to define them OUTSIDE the class methods. </p>

<p>If you don't understand a single word of what I am saying, then Google "Object Oriented Programming." Once you understand this, you won't even need to ask that question :).</p>

<p>I'm surprised nobody has brought up Lua. Lua also uses the 'self' variable however it can be omitted but still used. C++ does the same with 'this'. I don't see any reason to have to declare 'self' in each function but you should still be able to use it just like you can with lua and C++. For a language that prides itself on being brief it's odd that it requires you to declare the self variable.</p>

<p>The use of the argument, conventionally called <code>self</code> isn't as hard to understand, as is why is it necessary? Or as to why explicitly mention it? That, I suppose, is a bigger question for most users who look up this question, or if it is not, they will certainly have the same question as they move forward learning python. I recommend them to read these couple of blogs:</p>

<p><a href="https://pythontips.com/2013/08/07/the-self-variable-in-python-explained/" rel="noreferrer">1: Use of self explained</a></p>

<p>Note that it is not a keyword.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first argument of every class method, including init, is always a reference to the current instance of the class. By convention, this argument is always named self. In the init method, self refers to the newly created object; in other class methods, it refers to the instance whose method was called. For example the below code is the same as the above code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2008/10/why-explicit-self-has-to-stay.html" rel="noreferrer">2: Why do we have it this way and why can we not eliminate it as an argument, like Java, and have a keyword instead</a></p>

<p>Another thing I would like to add is, an optional <code>self</code> argument allows me to declare static methods inside a class, by not writing <code>self</code>.</p>

<p>Code examples:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">MyClass</span>():
    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">staticMethod</span>():
        <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> <span class="hljs-string">"This is a static method"</span>

    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">objectMethod</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self</span>):
        <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> <span class="hljs-string">"This is an object method which needs an instance of a class, and that is what self refers to"</span>
</code></pre>

<p><strong>PS</strong>:This works only in Python 3.x.</p>

<p>In previous versions, you have to explicitly add <code>@staticmethod</code> decorator, otherwise <code>self</code> argument is obligatory. </p>

<p>Is because by the way python is designed the alternatives would hardly work. Python is designed to allow methods or functions to be defined in a context where both implicit <code>this</code> (a-la Java/C++) or explicit <code>@</code> (a-la ruby) wouldn't work. Let's have an example with the explicit approach with python conventions:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">fubar</span>(<span class="hljs-params">x</span>):
    self.x = x

<span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">C</span>:
    frob = fubar
</code></pre>

<p>Now the <code>fubar</code> function wouldn't work since it would assume that <code>self</code> is a global variable (and in <code>frob</code> as well). The alternative would be to execute method's with a replaced global scope (where <code>self</code> is the object).</p>

<p>The implicit approach would be</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">fubar</span>(<span class="hljs-params">x</span>)
    myX = x

<span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">C</span>:
    frob = fubar
</code></pre>

<p>This would mean that <code>myX</code> would be interpreted as a local variable in <code>fubar</code> (and in <code>frob</code> as well). The alternative here would be to execute methods with a replaced local scope which is retained between calls, but that would remove the posibility of method local variables.</p>

<p>However the current situation works out well:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"> <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">fubar</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self, x</span>)
     self.x = x

 <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">C</span>:

<h3><em><code>self</code> is inevitable.</em></h3>

<p>There was just a <a href="https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=239003" rel="nofollow noreferrer">question</a> should <code>self</code> be implicit or explicit.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Guido van Rossum</code></a> resolved this question saying <a href="https://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2008/10/why-explicit-self-has-to-stay.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>self</code> has to stay</a>.</p>

<h3><em>So where the <code>self</code> live?</em></h3>

<p>If we would just stick to functional programming we would not need <code>self</code>.
Once we enter the <em>Python OOP</em> we find <code>self</code> there.</p>

<p>Here is the typical use case <code>class C</code> with the method <code>m1</code></p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">C</span>:
    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">m1</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self, arg</span>):
        <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(self, <span class="hljs-string">' inside'</span>)
        <span class="hljs-keyword">pass</span>

ci =C()
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(ci, <span class="hljs-string">' outside'</span>)
ci.m1(<span class="hljs-literal">None</span>)
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">hex</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">id</span>(ci))) <span class="hljs-comment"># hex memory address</span>
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>This program will output:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">&lt;__main__.C <span class="hljs-built_in">object</span> at <span class="hljs-number">0x000002B9D79C6CC0</span>&gt;  outside
&lt;__main__.C <span class="hljs-built_in">object</span> at <span class="hljs-number">0x000002B9D79C6CC0</span>&gt;  inside
<span class="hljs-number">0x2b9d79c6cc0</span>
</code></pre>

<p>So <code>self</code> holds the memory address of the class instance.
<em>The purpose</em> of <code>self</code> would be to hold the reference for <em>instance methods</em> and for us to have <strong>explicit</strong> access to that reference.     </p>

<hr>

<p><sub>Note there are three different types of class methods: </sub></p>

<ul>
<li><sub>static methods (read: functions), </sub></li>
<li><sub>class methods, </sub></li>
<li><sub>instance methods (mentioned).</sub></li>
</ul>

<p>"self" keyword holds the reference of class and it is upto you if you want to use it or not but if you notice, whenever you create a new method in python, python automatically write self keyword for you. If you do some R&amp;D, you will notice that if you create say two methods in a class and try to call one inside another, it does not recognize method unless you add self (reference of class).</p>

<p>Now let see below example</p>

    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'method 2'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Now when you create object of class testA, you can call method m1() using class object like this as method m1() has included self keyword</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">obj = testA()
obj.m1()
</code></pre>
<p>But if you want to call method m2(), because is has no self reference so you can call m2() directly using class name like below</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">testA.m2()
</code></pre>
<p>But keep in practice to live with self keyword as there are other benefits too of it like creating global variable inside and so on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the special thing about methods is that the instance object is passed as the first argument of the function. In our example, the call <code>x.f()</code> is exactly equivalent to <code>MyClass.f(x)</code>. In general, calling a method with a list of n arguments is equivalent to calling the corresponding function with an argument list that is created by inserting the methods instance object before the first argument.</p>

<p>I would say for Python at least, the self parameter can be thought of as a placeholder.
Take a look at this:</p>

  <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">__init__</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self, name, age</span>):

    self.age = age

p1 = Person(<span class="hljs-string">"John"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">36</span>)

<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(p1.name)
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(p1.age)
</code></pre>
<p>Self in this case and a lot of others was used as a method to say store the name value. However, after that, we use the p1 to assign it to the class we're using. Then when we print it we use the same p1 keyword.</p>
<p>Hope this helps for Python!</p>

Python decided to do methods in a way that makes the instance to which the method belongs be \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;passed\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; automatically, but not \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;received\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; automatically: the first parameter of methods is the instance the method is called on.

You don\u0026apos;t actually write instance methods in Python; what you write is class methods which must take an instance as a first parameter. And therefore, youll have to place the instance parameter somewhere explicitly.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When objects are instantiated, the object itself is passed into the self parameter. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/whCZm.png\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;enter image description here\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Because of this, the objects data is bound to the object. Below is an example of how you might like to visualize what each objects data might look. Notice how self is replaced with the objects name. I\u0026apos;m not saying this example diagram below is wholly accurate but it hopefully with serve a purpose in visualizing the use of self. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/5daR6.png\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;enter image description here\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The Object is passed into the self parameter so that the object can keep hold of its own data.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Although this may not be wholly accurate, think of the process of instantiating an object like this: When an object is made it uses the class as a template for its own data and methods. Without passing it\u0026apos;s own name into the self parameter, the attributes and methods in the class would remain as a general template and would not be referenced to (belong to) the object. So by passing the object\u0026apos;s name into the self parameter it means that if 100 objects are instantiated from the one class, they can all keep track of their own data and methods.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;See the illustration below:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/oZZe5.png\u0026quot;
