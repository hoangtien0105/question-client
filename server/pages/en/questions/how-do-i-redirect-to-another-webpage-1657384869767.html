So you should not be using jQuery for a page redirect.\nA quote from Jquery.com:\n\nWhile jQuery might run without major issues in older browser versions,\nwe do not actively test jQuery in them and generally do not fix bugs\nthat may appear in them.\n\nIt was found here:\nhttps://jquery.com/browser-support/\nSo jQuery is not an end-all and be-all solution for backwards compatibility.\nThe following solution using raw JavaScript works in all browsers and have been standard for a long time so you don&apos;t need any libraries for cross browser support.\nThis page will redirect to Google after 3000 milliseconds\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;example&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;p&gt;You will be redirected to google shortly.&lt;/p&gt;\n        &lt;script&gt;\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                window.location.href=&quot;http://www.google.com&quot;; // The URL that will be redirected too.\n            }, 3000); // The bigger the number the longer the delay.\n        &lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nDifferent options are as follows:\nwindow.location.href=&quot;url&quot;; // Simulates normal navigation to a new page\nwindow.location.replace(&quot;url&quot;); // Removes current URL from history and replaces it with a new URL\nwindow.location.assign(&quot;url&quot;); // Adds new URL to the history stack and redirects to the new URL\n\nwindow.history.back(); // Simulates a back button click\nwindow.history.go(-1); // Simulates a back button click\nwindow.history.back(-1); // Simulates a back button click\nwindow.navigate(&quot;page.html&quot;); // Same as window.location=&quot;url&quot;\n\nWhen using replace, the back button will not go back to the redirect page, as if it was never in the history. If you want the user to be able to go back to the redirect page then use window.location.href or window.location.assign. If you do use an option that lets the user go back to the redirect page, remember that when you enter the redirect page it will redirect you back. So put that into consideration when picking an option for your redirect. Under conditions where the page is only redirecting when an action is done by the user then having the page in the back button history will be okay. But if the page auto redirects then you should use replace so that the user can use the back button without getting forced back to the page the redirect sends.\nYou can also use meta data to run a page redirect as followed.\nMETA Refresh\n&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;refresh&quot; content=&quot;0;url=http://evil.example/&quot; /&gt;\n\nMETA Location\n&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;location&quot; content=&quot;URL=http://evil.example&quot; /&gt;\n\nBASE Hijacking\n&lt;base href=&quot;http://evil.example/&quot; /&gt;\n\nMany more methods to redirect your unsuspecting client to a page they may not wish to go can be found on this page (not one of them is reliant on jQuery):\n\nhttps://code.google.com/p/html5security/wiki/RedirectionMethods\n\nI would also like to point out, people don&apos;t like to be randomly redirected. Only redirect people when absolutely needed. If you start redirecting people randomly they will never go to your site again.\nThe next paragraph is hypothetical:\nYou also may get reported as a malicious site. If that happens then when people click on a link to your site the users browser may warn them that your site is malicious. What may also happen is search engines may start dropping your rating if people are reporting a bad experience on your site.\nPlease review Google Webmaster Guidelines about redirects:\nhttps://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2721217?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6001971\nHere is a fun little page that kicks you out of the page.\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n    &lt;head&gt;\n        &lt;title&gt;Go Away&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;/head&gt;\n    &lt;body&gt;\n        &lt;h1&gt;Go Away&lt;/h1&gt;\n        &lt;script&gt;\n            setTimeout(function(){\n                window.history.back();\n            }, 3000);\n        &lt;/script&gt;\n    &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nIf you combine the two page examples together you would have an infant loop of rerouting that will guarantee that your user will never want to use your site ever again.\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/how-do-i-redirect-to-another-webpage-1657384869767#solution12","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"var url = &apos;asdf.html&apos;;\nwindow.location.href = url;\n\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/how-do-i-redirect-to-another-webpage-1657384869767#solution13","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You can do that without jQuery as:\n\nwindow.location = &quot;http://yourdomain.com&quot;;\n\n\nAnd if you want only jQuery then you can do it like:\n\n$jq(window).attr(&quot;location&quot;,&quot;http://yourdomain.com&quot;);\n\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/how-do-i-redirect-to-another-webpage-1657384869767#solution14","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"This works with jQuery:\n\n$(window).attr(&quot;location&quot;, &quot;http://google.fr&quot;);\n\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/how-do-i-redirect-to-another-webpage-1657384869767#solution15","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"# HTML Page Redirect Using jQuery/JavaScript Method\nTry this example code:\nfunction YourJavaScriptFunction()\n{\n    var i = $(&apos;#login&apos;).val();\n    if (i == &apos;login&apos;)\n        window.location = &quot;Login.php&quot;;\n    else\n        window.location = &quot;Logout.php&quot;;\n}\n\nIf you want to give a complete URL as window.location = &quot;www.google.co.in&quot;;.\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/how-do-i-redirect-to-another-webpage-1657384869767#solution16","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Original question: &quot;How to redirect using jQuery?&quot;, hence the answer implements jQuery &gt;&gt; Complimentary usage case.\n\n\n\nTo just redirect to a page with JavaScript:\n\nwindow.location.href = &quot;/contact/&quot;;\n\n\nOr if you need a delay:\n\nsetTimeout(function () {\n  window.location.href = &quot;/contact/&quot;;\n}, 2000);   // Time in milliseconds\n\n\njQuery allows you to select elements from a web page with ease.

With jQuery you can connect to this code with just a line or two.\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/how-do-i-redirect-to-another-webpage-1657384869767#solution17","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You need to put this line in your code:\n\n$(location).attr(&quot;href&quot;,&quot;http://stackoverflow.com&quot;);\n\n\nIf you don&apos;t have jQuery, go with JavaScript:\n\nwindow.location.replace(&quot;http://stackoverflow.com&quot;);\nwindow.location.href(&quot;http://stackoverflow.com&quot;);\n\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/how-do-i-redirect-to-another-webpage-1657384869767#solution18","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"So, the question is how to make a redirect page, and not how to redirect to a website?\nYou only need to use JavaScript for this.

<h2>One does not simply redirect using jQuery</h2>

<p>jQuery is not necessary, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/replace" rel="noreferrer"><strong><code>window.location.replace(...)</code></strong></a> will best simulate an HTTP redirect.  </p>

<p><code>window.location.replace(...)</code> is better than using <code>window.location.href</code>, because <code>replace()</code> does not keep the originating page in the session history, meaning the user won't get stuck in a never-ending back-button fiasco.</p>

<p>If you want to simulate someone clicking on a link, use
 <strong><code>location.href</code></strong></p>

<p>If you want to simulate an HTTP redirect, use <strong><code>location.replace</code></strong></p>

<p>The following section is for those using <code>HTTP_REFERER</code> as one of many security measures (although it isn't a great protective measure). If you're using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_8" rel="noreferrer">Internet&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;8</a> or lower, these variables get lost when using any form of JavaScript page redirection (location.href,  etc.).</p>
<p>Below we are going to implement an alternative for <strong>IE8 &amp; lower</strong> so that we don't lose HTTP_REFERER. Otherwise, you can almost always simply use <code>window.location.href</code>.</p>
<p>Testing against <code>HTTP_REFERER</code> (URL pasting, session, etc.) <em>can</em> help tell whether a request is legitimate.
<em>(<strong>Note:</strong> there are also ways to work-around / spoof these referrers, as noted by droop's link in the comments)</em></p>

<p>It would help if you were a little more descriptive in what you are trying to do.  If you are trying to generate paged data, there are some options in how you do this.  You can generate separate links for each page that you want to be able to get directly to.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;a href=<span class="hljs-string">'/path-to-page?page=1'</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">'pager-link'</span>&gt;<span class="hljs-number">1</span>&lt;/a&gt;

<span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">span</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">'pager-link current-page'</span>&gt;</span>3<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">a</span>&gt;</span></span>
...
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the current page in the example is handled differently in the code and with CSS.</p>

<p>If you want the paged data to be changed via AJAX, this is where jQuery would come in.  What you would do is add a click handler to each of the anchor tags corresponding to a different page.  This click handler would invoke some jQuery code that goes and fetches the next page via AJAX and updates the table with the new data.  The example below assumes that you have a web service that returns the new page data.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$(<span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">ready</span>( <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {

<p>I also think that <code>location.replace(URL)</code> is the best way, but if you want to notify the search engines about your redirection (they don't analyze JavaScript code to see the redirection) you should add the <code>rel="canonical"</code> meta tag to your website.</p>
<p>Adding a noscript section with a HTML refresh meta tag in it, is also a good solution. I suggest you to use this <a href="http://insider.zone/tools/client-side-url-redirect-generator/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" title="Client-side URL redirect code generator">JavaScript redirection tool</a> to create redirections. It also has Internet&nbsp;Explorer support to pass the HTTP referrer.</p>

<p>JavaScript provides you many methods to retrieve and change the current URL which is displayed in browser's address bar. All these methods uses the Location object, which is  a property of the Window object. You can create a new Location object that has the current URL as follows..</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> currentLocation = <span class="hljs-variable language_">window</span>.<span class="hljs-property">location</span>;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Basic Structure of a URL</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;protocol&gt;<span class="hljs-comment">//&lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;pathname&gt;&lt;search&gt;&lt;hash&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4kiBE.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Protocol -- Specifies the protocol name be used to access the resource on the Internet. (HTTP (without SSL) or HTTPS (with SSL))</p></li>
<li><p>hostname -- Host name specifies the host that owns the resource. For example, www.stackoverflow.com. A server provides services using the name of the host.</p></li>
<li><p>port -- A port number used to recognize a specific process to which an Internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server.</p></li>
<li><p>pathname -- The path gives info about the specific resource within the host that the Web client wants to access. For example, stackoverflow.com/index.html.</p></li>
<li><p>query --  A query string follows the path component, and provides a string of information that the resource can utilize for some purpose (for example, as parameters for a search or as data to be processed). </p></li>
<li><p>hash -- The anchor portion of a URL, includes the hash sign (#).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>With these Location object properties you can access all of these URL components</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>hash</strong>   -Sets or returns the anchor portion of a URL.  </li>
<li><strong>host</strong>   -Sets
or returns the hostname and port of a URL.   </li>
<li><strong>hostname</strong>   -Sets or
returns the hostname of a URL.   </li>
<li><strong>href</strong>   -Sets or returns the entire
URL.  </li>
<li><strong>pathname</strong>   -Sets or returns the path name of a URL.   </li>
<li><strong>port</strong> -Sets or returns the port number the server uses for a URL.  </li>
<li><strong>protocol</strong>   -Sets or returns the protocol of a URL.   </li>
<li><strong>search</strong>   -Sets
or returns the query portion of a URL</li>
</ol>

<p>Now If you want to change a page or redirect the user to some other page you can use the <code>href</code> property of the Location object like this</p>

<p>You can use the href property of the Location object.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-variable language_">window</span>.<span class="hljs-property">location</span>.<span class="hljs-property">href</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"http://www.stackoverflow.com"</span>;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Location Object</strong> also have these three methods</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>assign()</strong> -- Loads a new document.</li>
<li><strong>reload()</strong> -- Reloads the current document.</li>
<li><strong>replace()</strong> -- Replaces the current document with a new one</li>
</ol>

<p>You can use assign() and replace methods also to redirect to other pages like these</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">location.<span class="hljs-title function_">assign</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"http://www.stackoverflow.com"</span>);

location.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"http://www.stackoverflow.com"</span>);
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>How assign() and replace() differs</em></strong><em> -- The difference between replace() method and assign() method(), is that replace() removes the URL of the current document from the document history, means it is not possible to use the "back" button to navigate back to the original document. So Use the assign() method if you want to load a new document, andwant to give the option to navigate back to the original document.</em></p>

<p>You can change the location object href property using <strong>jQuery</strong> also  like this</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$(location).<span class="hljs-title function_">attr</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'href'</span>,url);
</code></pre>

<p>And hence you can redirect the user to some other url.</p>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution10" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl solution-inner border md:px-10 md:py-10 px-2 py-10 shadow-md bg-white"><div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-between"><h1 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 10</h1><div class="tags-wrap h-max space-x-8"><div class="tags"><a class="rounded-2xl border bg-neutral-100 px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold whitespace-nowrap" href="/questions/tag/redirect">redirect</a></div></div></div><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>Basically <strong>jQuery</strong> is just a <strong>JavaScript</strong> framework and for doing some of the things like <strong>redirection</strong> in this case, you can just use pure JavaScript, so in that case you have 3 options using vanilla JavaScript:</p>

<p>1) Using location <strong>replace</strong>, this will replace the current history of the page, means that it is not possible to use the <strong>back</strong> button to go back to the original page.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-variable language_">window</span>.<span class="hljs-property">location</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"http://stackoverflow.com"</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>2) Using location <strong>assign</strong>, this will keep the history for you and with using back button, you can go back to the original page:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-variable language_">window</span>.<span class="hljs-property">location</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">assign</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"http://stackoverflow.com"</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>3) I recommend using one of those previous ways, but this could be the third option using pure JavaScript: </p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-variable language_">window</span>.<span class="hljs-property">location</span>.<span class="hljs-property">href</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"http://stackoverflow.com"</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>You can also write a function in jQuery to handle it, but not recommended as it's only one line pure JavaScript function, also you can use all of above functions without window if you are already in the window scope, for example <code>window.location.replace("http://stackoverflow.com");</code> could be <code>location.replace("http://stackoverflow.com");</code></p>

<p>Also I show them all on the image below:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ODheM.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ODheM.jpg" alt="location.replace location.assign"></a></p>

<p>Should just be able to set using <code>window.location</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Before I start, jQuery is a JavaScript library used for DOM manipulation. So you should not be using jQuery for a page redirect.</strong></p>
<p>A quote from Jquery.com:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While jQuery might run without major issues in older browser versions,
we do not actively test jQuery in them and generally do not fix bugs
that may appear in them.</p>

<p>It was found here:
<a href="https://jquery.com/browser-support/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://jquery.com/browser-support/</a></p>
<p>So jQuery is not an end-all and be-all solution for backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>The following solution using raw JavaScript works in all browsers and have been standard for a long time so you don't need any libraries for cross browser support.</p>
<p>This page will redirect to <strong><a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Google</a></strong> after 3000 milliseconds</p>

</code></pre>
<p>When using replace, the back button will not go back to the redirect page, as if it was never in the history. If you want the user to be able to go back to the redirect page then use <code>window.location.href</code> or <code>window.location.assign</code>. If you do use an option that lets the user go back to the redirect page, remember that when you enter the redirect page it will redirect you back. So put that into consideration when picking an option for your redirect. Under conditions where the page is only redirecting when an action is done by the user then having the page in the back button history will be okay. But if the page auto redirects then you should use replace so that the user can use the back button without getting forced back to the page the redirect sends.</p>
<p>You can also use meta data to run a page redirect as followed.</p>
<p><strong>META Refresh</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;meta http-equiv=<span class="hljs-string">"refresh"</span> content=<span class="hljs-string">"0;url=http://evil.example/"</span> /&gt;

<p><strong>META Location</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;meta http-equiv=<span class="hljs-string">"location"</span> content=<span class="hljs-string">"URL=http://evil.example"</span> /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>BASE Hijacking</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;base href=<span class="hljs-string">"http://evil.example/"</span> /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Many more methods to redirect your unsuspecting client to a page they may not wish to go can be found on this page (not one of them is reliant on jQuery):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/html5security/wiki/RedirectionMethods" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://code.google.com/p/html5security/wiki/RedirectionMethods</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would also like to point out, people don't like to be randomly redirected. Only redirect people when absolutely needed. If you start redirecting people randomly they will never go to your site again.</p>
<p>The next paragraph is hypothetical:</p>
<p>You also may get reported as a malicious site. If that happens then when people click on a link to your site the users browser may warn them that your site is malicious. What may also happen is search engines may start dropping your rating if people are reporting a bad experience on your site.</p>

<p>jQuery allows you to select elements from a web page with ease. You can find anything you want on a page and then use jQuery to add special effects, react to user actions, or show and hide content inside or outside the element you have selected. All these tasks start with knowing <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/" rel="noreferrer">how to select an element or an event</a>.</p>

<p>So, the question is how to make a redirect page, and not how to redirect to a website?</p>
<p>You only need to use JavaScript for this. Here is some tiny code that will create a dynamic redirect page.</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;script&gt;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> url = <span class="hljs-variable language_">window</span>.<span class="hljs-property">location</span>.<span class="hljs-property">search</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">split</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'url='</span>)[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]; <span class="hljs-comment">// Get the URL after ?url=</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>( url ) <span class="hljs-variable language_">window</span>.<span class="hljs-property">location</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(url);
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So say you just put this snippet into a <code>redirect/index.html</code> file on your website you can use it like so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>http://www.mywebsite.com/redirect?url=http://stackoverflow.com</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you go to that link it will automatically redirect you to <strong>stackoverflow.com</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window.location" rel="noreferrer">Link to Documentation</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>And that's how you make a <em>Simple</em> redirect page with JavaScript</strong></p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>There is also one thing to note. I have added <code>window.location.replace</code> in my code because I think it suits a redirect page, but, you must know that when using <code>window.location.replace</code> and you get redirected, when you press the back button in your browser it will <strong>not</strong> got back to the redirect page, and it will go back to the page before it, take a look at this little demo thing.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The process: <strong>store home</strong> =&gt; <strong>redirect page to google</strong> =&gt; <strong>google</strong></p>
<p>When at google: <strong>google</strong> =&gt; <strong>back button in browser</strong> =&gt; <strong>store home</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if this suits your needs then everything should be fine. If you want to include the redirect page in the browser history replace this</p>

<p>Please don't kill me, this is a joke. It's a joke. <em>This is a joke.</em></p>

<p>This did "provide an answer to the question", in the sense that it asked for a solution "using jQuery" which in this case entails forcing it into the equation somehow.</p>

<p>Ferrybig apparently needs the joke explained (still joking, I'm sure there are limited options on the review form), so without further ado:</p>

<p>Other answers are using jQuery's <code>attr()</code> on the <code>location</code> or <code>window</code> objects unnecessarily.</p>

<p>This answer also abuses it, but in a more ridiculous way. Instead of using it to set the location, this uses <code>attr()</code> to retrieve a function that sets the location.</p>

<p>The function is named <code>jQueryCode</code> even though there's nothing jQuery about it, and calling a function <code>somethingCode</code> is just horrible, especially when the something is not even a language.</p>

<p>The "85 bytes" is a reference to Code Golf. Golfing is obviously not something you should do outside of code golf, and furthermore this answer is clearly not actually golfed.</p>

<p>Basically, cringe.</p>

If you want the user to be able to go back to the redirect page then use \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;window.location.href\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;window.location.assign\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. If you do use an option that lets the user go back to the redirect page, remember that when you enter the redirect page it will redirect you back. So put that into consideration when picking an option for your redirect. Under conditions where the page is only redirecting when an action is done by the user then having the page in the back button history will be okay. But if the page auto redirects then you should use replace so that the user can use the back button without getting forced back to the page the redirect sends.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You can also use meta data to run a page redirect as followed.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;META Refresh\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-js s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026amp;lt;meta http-equiv=\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;refresh\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; content=\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;0;url=http://evil.example/\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; /\u0026amp;gt;\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;META Location\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-js s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026amp;lt;meta http-equiv=\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;location\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; content=\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;URL=http://evil.example\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; /\u0026amp;gt;\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;BASE Hijacking\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-js s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026amp;lt;base href=\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;http://evil.example/\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; /\u0026amp;gt;\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Many more methods to redirect your unsuspecting client to a page they may not wish to go can be found on this page (not one of them is reliant on jQuery):\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://code.google.com/p/html5security/wiki/RedirectionMethods\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;nofollow noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;https://code.google.com/p/html5security/wiki/RedirectionMethods\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I would also like to point out, people don\u0026apos;t like to be randomly redirected.
