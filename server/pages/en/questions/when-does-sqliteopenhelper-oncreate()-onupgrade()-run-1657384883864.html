The database is not opened when the database helper object itself is created.\n\nSQLiteOpenHelper versions the database files. The version number is the int argument passed to the constructor. In the database file, the version number is stored in PRAGMA user_version.\n\nonCreate() is only run when the database file did not exist and was just created. If onCreate() returns successfully (doesn&apos;t throw an exception), the database is assumed to be created with the requested version number. As an implication, you should not catch SQLExceptions in onCreate() yourself.\n\nonUpgrade() is only called when the database file exists but the stored version number is lower than requested in the constructor. The onUpgrade() should update the table schema to the requested version.\n\nWhen changing the table schema in code (onCreate()), you should make sure the database is updated. Two main approaches:\n\n\nDelete the old database file so that onCreate() is run again. This is often preferred at development time where you have control over the installed versions and data loss is not an issue. Some ways to delete the database file:\n\n\nUninstall the application. Use the application manager or adb uninstall your.package.name from the shell.\nClear application data. Use the application manager.\n\nIncrement the database version so that onUpgrade() is invoked. This is slightly more complicated as more code is needed.\n\n\nFor development time schema upgrades where data loss is not an issue, you can just use execSQL(&quot;DROP TABLE IF EXISTS &lt;tablename&gt;&quot;) in to remove your existing tables and call onCreate() to recreate the database.\nFor released versions, you should implement data migration in onUpgrade() so your users don&apos;t lose their data.\n\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"To further add missing points here, as per the request by Jaskey\n\nDatabase version is stored within the SQLite database file.\n\ncatch is the constructor\n\nSQLiteOpenHelper(Context context, String name, SQLiteDatabase.CursorFactory factory, int version)\n\n\nSo when the database helper constructor is called with a name (2nd param), platform checks if the database exists or not and if the database exists, it gets the version information from the database file header and triggers the right call back\n\nAs already explained in the older answer, if the database with the name doesn&apos;t exists, it triggers onCreate.\n\nBelow explanation explains onUpgrade case with an example.\n\nSay, your first version of application had the DatabaseHelper (extending SQLiteOpenHelper) with constructor passing version as 1 and then you provided an upgraded application with the new source code having version passed as 2, then automatically when the DatabaseHelper is constructed, platform triggers onUpgrade by seeing the file already exists, but the version is lower than the current version which you have passed.\n\nNow say you are planing to give a third version of application with db version as 3 (db version is increased only when database schema is to be modified). In such incremental upgrades, you have to write the upgrade logic from each version incrementally for a better maintainable code\n\nExample pseudo code below:\n\n@Override\npublic void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) {\n  switch(oldVersion) {\n    case 1:\n       //upgrade logic from version 1 to 2\n    case 2:\n       //upgrade logic from version 2 to 3\n    case 3:\n       //upgrade logic from version 3 to 4\n       break;\n    default:\n       throw new IllegalStateException(\n                &quot;onUpgrade() with unknown oldVersion &quot; + oldVersion);\n  }\n}\n\n\nNotice the missing break statement in case 1 and 2. This is what I mean by incremental upgrade.\n\nSay if the old version is 2 and new version is 4, then the logic will upgrade the database from 2 to 3 and then to 4\n\nIf old version is 3 and new version is 4, it will just run the upgrade logic for 3 to 4\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"onCreate()\n\n\nWhen we create DataBase at a first time (i.e Database is not exists) onCreate() create database with version which is passed in \nSQLiteOpenHelper(Context context, String name, SQLiteDatabase.CursorFactory factory, int version)\nonCreate() method is creating the tables youve defined and executing any other code youve written.

The database is not opened when the database helper object itself is created.</p>

<p><code>SQLiteOpenHelper</code> versions the database files. The version number is the <code>int</code> argument passed to the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/database/sqlite/SQLiteOpenHelper.html#SQLiteOpenHelper%28android.content.Context,%20java.lang.String,%20android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase.CursorFactory,%20int%29" rel="noreferrer">constructor</a>. In the database file, the version number is stored in <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_schema_version" rel="noreferrer"><code>PRAGMA user_version</code></a>.</p>

<p><code>onCreate()</code> is only run when the database file did not exist and was just created. If <code>onCreate()</code> returns successfully (doesn't throw an exception), the database is assumed to be created with the requested version number. As an implication, you should not catch <code>SQLException</code>s in <code>onCreate()</code> yourself.</p>

<p><code>onUpgrade()</code> is only called when the database file exists but the stored version number is lower than requested in the constructor. The <code>onUpgrade()</code> should update the table schema to the requested version.</p>

<p>When changing the table schema in code (<code>onCreate()</code>), you should make sure the database is updated. Two main approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Delete the old database file so that <code>onCreate()</code> is run again. This is often preferred at development time where you have control over the installed versions and data loss is not an issue. Some ways to delete the database file:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Uninstall the application. Use the application manager or <code>adb uninstall your.package.name</code> from the shell.</p></li>
<li><p>Clear application data. Use the application manager.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Increment the database version so that <code>onUpgrade()</code> is invoked. This is slightly more complicated as more code is needed.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For development time schema upgrades where data loss is not an issue, you can just use <code>execSQL("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS &lt;tablename&gt;")</code> in to remove your existing tables and call <code>onCreate()</code> to recreate the database.</p></li>
<li><p>For released versions, you should implement data migration in <code>onUpgrade()</code> so your users don't lose their data.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<p>To further add missing points here, as per the request by Jaskey</p>

<p><strong>Database version is stored within the <code>SQLite</code> database file.</strong></p>

<p>catch is the constructor</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">SQLiteOpenHelper(Context context, String name, SQLiteDatabase.CursorFactory factory, <span class="hljs-type">int</span> version)
</code></pre>

<p>So when the database helper constructor is called with a <code>name</code> (2nd param), platform checks if the database exists or not and if the database exists, it gets the version information from the database file header and triggers the right call back</p>

<p>As already explained in the older answer, if the database with the name doesn't exists, it triggers <code>onCreate</code>.</p>

<p>Below explanation explains <code>onUpgrade</code> case with an example.</p>

<p>Say, your first version of application had the <code>DatabaseHelper</code> (extending <code>SQLiteOpenHelper</code>) with constructor passing version as <code>1</code> and then you provided an upgraded application with the new source code having version passed as <code>2</code>, then automatically when the <code>DatabaseHelper</code> is constructed, platform triggers <code>onUpgrade</code> by seeing the file already exists, but the version is lower than the current version which you have passed.</p>

<p>Now say you are planing to give a third version of application with db version as <code>3</code> (db version is increased only when database schema is to be modified). In such incremental upgrades, you have to write the upgrade logic from each version incrementally for a better maintainable code</p>

<p>Example pseudo code below:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-variable">@Override</span>
public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, <span class="hljs-type">int</span> oldVersion, <span class="hljs-type">int</span> newVersion) {
  switch(oldVersion) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>:
       <span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-operator">/</span>upgrade logic <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> version <span class="hljs-number">1</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span>:
       <span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-operator">/</span>upgrade logic <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> version <span class="hljs-number">2</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> <span class="hljs-number">3</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> <span class="hljs-number">3</span>:
       <span class="hljs-operator">/</span><span class="hljs-operator">/</span>upgrade logic <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> version <span class="hljs-number">3</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> <span class="hljs-number">4</span>
       break;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span>:
       throw <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> IllegalStateException(
                "onUpgrade() with unknown oldVersion " <span class="hljs-operator">+</span> oldVersion);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the missing <code>break</code> statement in case <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>. This is what I mean by incremental upgrade.</p>

<p>Say if the old version is <code>2</code> and new version is <code>4</code>, then the logic will upgrade the database from <code>2</code> to <code>3</code> and then to <code>4</code></p>

<p>If old version is <code>3</code> and new version is <code>4</code>, it will just run the upgrade logic for <code>3</code> to <code>4</code></p>

<p>May be I am too late but I would like to share my short and sweet answer.
Please check <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/31605916/2110812"><strong>Answer</strong></a>  for a same problem. It will definitely help you. No more deep specifications.</p>

<p>If you are confident about syntax for creating table, than it may happen when you add new column in your same table, for that...</p>

<p><strong>1) Uninstall from your device and run it again.</strong></p>

<p>OR</p>

<p><strong>2) Setting -&gt; app -&gt; ClearData</strong></p>

<p>OR</p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> Change <code>DATABASE_VERSION</code> in your "DatabaseHandler" class (If you have added new column than it will upgrade automatically)</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">public DatabaseHandler(Context context) {
    super(context, DATABASE_NAME, <span class="hljs-keyword">null</span>, DATABASE_VERSION);
}
</code></pre>

<p>OR</p>

<p><strong>4)</strong> Change <code>DATABASE_NAME</code> in your "DatabaseHandler" class (I faced same problem. But I succeed by changing <code>DATABASE_NAME</code>.)</p>
