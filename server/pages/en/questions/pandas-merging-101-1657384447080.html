Mostly notable mentions of better alternatives, wherever appropriate.\nHandling suffixes, removing extra columns, renaming outputs, and other specific use cases. There are other (read: better) posts that deal with that, so figure it out!\n\n\nNote\nMost examples default to INNER JOIN operations while demonstrating various features, unless otherwise specified.\nFurthermore, all the DataFrames here can be copied and replicated so\nyou can play with them. Also, see this\npost\non how to read DataFrames from your clipboard.\nLastly, all visual representation of JOIN operations have been hand-drawn using Google Drawings. Inspiration from here.\n\n\n\nEnough talk - just show me how to use merge!\nSetup &amp; Basics\nnp.random.seed(0)\nleft = pd.DataFrame({&apos;key&apos;: [&apos;A&apos;, &apos;B&apos;, &apos;C&apos;, &apos;D&apos;], &apos;value&apos;: np.random.randn(4)})\nright = pd.DataFrame({&apos;key&apos;: [&apos;B&apos;, &apos;D&apos;, &apos;E&apos;, &apos;F&apos;], &apos;value&apos;: np.random.randn(4)})\n\nleft\n\n  key     value\n0   A  1.764052\n1   B  0.400157\n2   C  0.978738\n3   D  2.240893\n\nright\n\n  key     value\n0   B  1.867558\n1   D -0.977278\n2   E  0.950088\n3   F -0.151357\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, the key column has the same name (for now).\nAn INNER JOIN is represented by\n\n\nNote\nThis, along with the forthcoming figures all follow this convention:\n\nblue indicates rows that are present in the merge result\nred indicates rows that are excluded from the result (i.e., removed)\ngreen indicates missing values that are replaced with NaNs in the result\n\n\nTo perform an INNER JOIN, call merge on the left DataFrame, specifying the right DataFrame and the join key (at the very least) as arguments.\nleft.merge(right, on=&apos;key&apos;)\n# Or, if you want to be explicit\n# left.merge(right, on=&apos;key&apos;, how=&apos;inner&apos;)\n\n  key   value_x   value_y\n0   B  0.400157  1.867558\n1   D  2.240893 -0.977278\n\nThis returns only rows from left and right which share a common key (in this example, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;D).\nA LEFT OUTER JOIN, or LEFT JOIN  is represented by\n\nThis can be performed by specifying how=&apos;left&apos;.\nleft.merge(right, on=&apos;key&apos;, how=&apos;left&apos;)\n\n  key   value_x   value_y\n0   A  1.764052       NaN\n1   B  0.400157  1.867558\n2   C  0.978738       NaN\n3   D  2.240893 -0.977278\n\nCarefully note the placement of NaNs here. If you specify how=&apos;left&apos;, then only keys from left are used, and missing data from right is replaced by NaN.\nAnd similarly, for a RIGHT OUTER JOIN, or RIGHT JOIN which is...\n\n...specify how=&apos;right&apos;:\nleft.merge(right, on=&apos;key&apos;, how=&apos;right&apos;)\n\n  key   value_x   value_y\n0   B  0.400157  1.867558\n1   D  2.240893 -0.977278\n2   E       NaN  0.950088\n3   F       NaN -0.151357\n\nHere, keys from right are used, and missing data from left is replaced by NaN.\nFinally, for the FULL OUTER JOIN, given by\n\nspecify how=&apos;outer&apos;.\nleft.merge(right, on=&apos;key&apos;, how=&apos;outer&apos;)\n\n  key   value_x   value_y\n0   A  1.764052       NaN\n1   B  0.400157  1.867558\n2   C  0.978738       NaN\n3   D  2.240893 -0.977278\n4   E       NaN  0.950088\n5   F       NaN -0.151357\n\nThis uses the keys from both frames, and NaNs are inserted for missing rows in both.\nThe documentation summarizes these various merges nicely:\n\n\nOther JOINs - LEFT-Excluding, RIGHT-Excluding, and FULL-Excluding/ANTI JOINs\nIf you need LEFT-Excluding JOINs and RIGHT-Excluding JOINs in two steps.\nFor LEFT-Excluding JOIN, represented as\n\nStart by performing a LEFT OUTER JOIN and then filtering to rows coming from left only (excluding everything from the right),\n(left.merge(right, on=&apos;key&apos;, how=&apos;left&apos;, indicator=True)\n     .query(&apos;_merge == &quot;left_only&quot;&apos;)\n     .drop(&apos;_merge&apos;, 1))\n\n  key   value_x  value_y\n0   A  1.764052      NaN\n2   C  0.978738      NaN\n\nWhere,\nleft.merge(right, on=&apos;key&apos;, how=&apos;left&apos;, indicator=True)\n\n  key   value_x   value_y     _merge\n0   A  1.764052       NaN  left_only\n1   B  0.400157  1.867558       both\n2   C  0.978738       NaN  left_only\n3   D  2.240893 -0.977278       both\nAnd similarly, for a RIGHT-Excluding JOIN,\n\n(left.merge(right, on=&apos;key&apos;, how=&apos;right&apos;, indicator=True)\n     .query(&apos;_merge == &quot;right_only&quot;&apos;)\n     .drop(&apos;_merge&apos;, 1))\n\n  key  value_x   value_y\n2   E      NaN  0.950088\n3   F      NaN -0.151357\nLastly, if you are required to do a merge that only retains keys from the left or right, but not both (IOW, performing an ANTI-JOIN),\n\nYou can do this in similar fashion\n(left.merge(right, on=&apos;key&apos;, how=&apos;outer&apos;, indicator=True)\n     .query(&apos;_merge != &quot;both&quot;&apos;)\n     .drop(&apos;_merge&apos;, 1))\n\n  key   value_x   value_y\n0   A  1.764052       NaN\n2   C  0.978738       NaN\n4   E       NaN  0.950088\n5   F       NaN -0.151357\n\n\nDifferent names for key columns\nIf the key columns are named differentlyfor example, left has keyLeft, and right has keyRight instead of keythen you will have to specify left_on and right_on as arguments instead of on:\nleft2 = left.rename({&apos;key&apos;:&apos;keyLeft&apos;}, axis=1)\nright2 = right.rename({&apos;key&apos;:&apos;keyRight&apos;}, axis=1)\n\nleft2\n\n  keyLeft     value\n0       A  1.764052\n1       B  0.400157\n2       C  0.978738\n3       D  2.240893\n\nright2\n\n  keyRight     value\n0        B  1.867558\n1        D -0.977278\n2        E  0.950088\n3        F -0.151357\n\n\nleft2.merge(right2, left_on=&apos;keyLeft&apos;, right_on=&apos;keyRight&apos;, how=&apos;inner&apos;)\n\n  keyLeft   value_x keyRight   value_y\n0       B  0.400157        B  1.867558\n1       D  2.240893        D -0.977278\n\n\nAvoiding duplicate key column in output\nWhen merging on keyLeft from left and keyRight from right, if you only want either of the keyLeft or keyRight (but not both) in the output, you can start by setting the index as a preliminary step.\nleft3 = left2.set_index(&apos;keyLeft&apos;)\nleft3.merge(right2, left_index=True, right_on=&apos;keyRight&apos;)\n\n    value_x keyRight   value_y\n0  0.400157        B  1.867558\n1  2.240893        D -0.977278\n\nContrast this with the output of the command just before (that is, the output of left2.merge(right2, left_on=&apos;keyLeft&apos;, right_on=&apos;keyRight&apos;, how=&apos;inner&apos;)), you&apos;ll notice keyLeft is missing. You can figure out what column to keep based on which frame&apos;s index is set as the key. This may matter when, say, performing some OUTER JOIN operation.\n\nMerging only a single column from one of the DataFrames\nFor example, consider\nright3 = right.assign(newcol=np.arange(len(right)))\nright3\n  key     value  newcol\n0   B  1.867558       0\n1   D -0.977278       1\n2   E  0.950088       2\n3   F -0.151357       3\n\nIf you are required to merge only &quot;newcol&quot; (without any of the other columns), you can usually just subset columns before merging:\nleft.merge(right3[[&apos;key&apos;, &apos;newcol&apos;]], on=&apos;key&apos;)\n\n  key     value  newcol\n0   B  0.400157       0\n1   D  2.240893       1\n\nIf you&apos;re doing a LEFT OUTER JOIN, a more performant solution would involve map:\n# left[&apos;newcol&apos;] = left[&apos;key&apos;].map(right3.set_index(&apos;key&apos;)[&apos;newcol&apos;]))\nleft.assign(newcol=left[&apos;key&apos;].map(right3.set_index(&apos;key&apos;)[&apos;newcol&apos;]))\n\n  key     value  newcol\n0   A  1.764052     NaN\n1   B  0.400157     0.0\n2   C  0.978738     NaN\n3   D  2.240893     1.0\n\nAs mentioned, this is similar to, but faster than\nleft.merge(right3[[&apos;key&apos;, &apos;newcol&apos;]], on=&apos;key&apos;, how=&apos;left&apos;)\n\n  key     value  newcol\n0   A  1.764052     NaN\n1   B  0.400157     0.0\n2   C  0.978738     NaN\n3   D  2.240893     1.0\n\n\nMerging on multiple columns\nTo join on more than one column, specify a list for on (or left_on and right_on, as appropriate).\nleft.merge(right, on=[&apos;key1&apos;, &apos;key2&apos;] ...)\n\nOr, in the event the names are different,\nleft.merge(right, left_on=[&apos;lkey1&apos;, &apos;lkey2&apos;], right_on=[&apos;rkey1&apos;, &apos;rkey2&apos;])\n\n\nOther useful merge* operations and functions\n\nMerging a DataFrame with Series on index: See this answer.\n\nBesides merge, DataFrame.update and DataFrame.combine_first are also used in certain cases to update one DataFrame with another.\n\npd.merge_ordered is a useful function for ordered JOINs.\n\npd.merge_asof (read: merge_asOf) is useful for approximate joins.\n\n\nThis section only covers the very basics, and is designed to only whet your appetite.

Note that only merge can perform index to column joins. You can join on multiple columns, provided the number of index levels on the left equals the number of columns on the right.\njoin and concat are not capable of mixed merges. You will need to set the index as a pre-step using DataFrame.set_index.\n\nEffectively using Named Index [pandas &gt;= 0.23]\nIf your index is named, then from pandas &gt;= 0.23, DataFrame.merge allows you to specify the index name to on (or left_on and right_on as necessary).\nleft.merge(right, on=&apos;idxkey&apos;)\n\n         value_x   value_y\nidxkey                    \nB      -0.402655  0.543843\nD      -0.524349  0.013135\n\nFor the previous example of merging with the index of left, column of right, you can use left_on with the index name of left:\nleft.merge(right2, left_on=&apos;idxkey&apos;, right_on=&apos;colkey&apos;)\n\n    value_x colkey   value_y\n0 -0.402655      B  0.543843\n1 -0.524349      D  0.013135\n\n\n\nContinue Reading\nJump to other topics in Pandas Merging 101 to continue learning:\n\nMerging basics - basic types of joins\n\nIndex-based joins*\n\nGeneralizing to multiple DataFrames\n\nCross join\n\n\n* you are here \n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"This post will go through the following topics:\n\nhow to correctly generalize to multiple DataFrames (and why merge has shortcomings here)\nmerging on unique keys\nmerging on non-unqiue keys\n\nBACK TO TOP\n\n\nGeneralizing to multiple DataFrames\nOftentimes, the situation arises when multiple DataFrames are to be merged together. Naively, this can be done by chaining merge calls:\ndf1.merge(df2, ...).merge(df3, ...)\n\nHowever, this quickly gets out of hand for many DataFrames. Furthermore, it may be necessary to generalise for an unknown number of DataFrames.\nHere I introduce pd.concat for multi-way joins on unique keys, and DataFrame.join for multi-way joins on non-unique keys. First, the setup.\n# Setup.\nnp.random.seed(0)\nA = pd.DataFrame({&apos;key&apos;: [&apos;A&apos;, &apos;B&apos;, &apos;C&apos;, &apos;D&apos;], &apos;valueA&apos;: np.random.randn(4)})    \nB = pd.DataFrame({&apos;key&apos;: [&apos;B&apos;, &apos;D&apos;, &apos;E&apos;, &apos;F&apos;], &apos;valueB&apos;: np.random.randn(4)})\nC = pd.DataFrame({&apos;key&apos;: [&apos;D&apos;, &apos;E&apos;, &apos;J&apos;, &apos;C&apos;], &apos;valueC&apos;: np.ones(4)})\ndfs = [A, B, C] \n\n# Note: the &quot;key&quot; column values are unique, so the index is unique.\nA2 = A.set_index(&apos;key&apos;)\nB2 = B.set_index(&apos;key&apos;)\nC2 = C.set_index(&apos;key&apos;)\n\ndfs2 = [A2, B2, C2]\n\n\nMultiway merge on unique keys\nIf your keys (here, the key could either be a column or an index) are unique, then you can use pd.concat. Note that pd.concat joins DataFrames on the index.\n# Merge on `key` column. You&apos;ll need to set the index before concatenating\npd.concat(\n    [df.set_index(&apos;key&apos;) for df in dfs], axis=1, join=&apos;inner&apos;\n).reset_index()\n\n  key    valueA    valueB  valueC\n0   D  2.240893 -0.977278     1.0\n\n# Merge on `key` index.\npd.concat(dfs2, axis=1, sort=False, join=&apos;inner&apos;)\n\n       valueA    valueB  valueC\nkey                            \nD    2.240893 -0.977278     1.0\n\nOmit join=&apos;inner&apos; for a FULL OUTER JOIN. Note that you cannot specify LEFT or RIGHT OUTER joins (if you need these, use join, described below).\n\nMultiway merge on keys with duplicates\nconcat is fast, but has its shortcomings. It cannot handle duplicates.\nA3 = pd.DataFrame({&apos;key&apos;: [&apos;A&apos;, &apos;B&apos;, &apos;C&apos;, &apos;D&apos;, &apos;D&apos;], &apos;valueA&apos;: np.random.randn(5)})\npd.concat([df.set_index(&apos;key&apos;) for df in [A3, B, C]], axis=1, join=&apos;inner&apos;)\n\nValueError: Shape of passed values is (3, 4), indices imply (3, 2)\n\nIn this situation, we can use join since it can handle non-unique keys (note that join joins DataFrames on their index; it calls merge under the hood and does a LEFT OUTER JOIN unless otherwise specified).\n# Join on `key` column. Set as the index first.\n# For inner join. For left join, omit the &quot;how&quot; argument.\nA.set_index(&apos;key&apos;).join([B2, C2], how=&apos;inner&apos;).reset_index()\n\n  key    valueA    valueB  valueC\n0   D  2.240893 -0.977278

<p>This post aims to give readers a primer on SQL-flavored merging with Pandas, how to use it, and when not to use it.</p>
<p>In particular, here's what this post will go through:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The basics - types of joins (LEFT, RIGHT, OUTER, INNER)</p>
<ul>
<li>merging with different column names</li>
<li>merging with multiple columns</li>
<li>avoiding duplicate merge key column in output</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What this post (and other posts by me on this thread) will not go through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance-related discussions and timings (for now). Mostly notable mentions of better alternatives, wherever appropriate.</li>
<li>Handling suffixes, removing extra columns, renaming outputs, and other specific use cases. There are other (read: better) posts that deal with that, so figure it out!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>
Most examples default to INNER JOIN operations while demonstrating various features, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the DataFrames here can be copied and replicated so
you can play with them. Also, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31610889/how-to-copy-paste-dataframe-from-stackoverflow-into-python">this

<h3><strong>Other JOINs - LEFT-Excluding, RIGHT-Excluding, and FULL-Excluding/ANTI JOINs</strong></h3>
<p>If you need <strong>LEFT-Excluding JOINs</strong> and <strong>RIGHT-Excluding JOINs</strong> in two steps.</p>
<p>For LEFT-Excluding JOIN, represented as</p>
<img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/bXWIV.png" width="500">
<p>Start by performing a LEFT OUTER JOIN and then filtering to rows coming from <code>left</code> only (excluding everything from the right),</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">(left.merge(right, on=<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>, how=<span class="hljs-string">'left'</span>, indicator=<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>)

<p>Where,</p>

<h3><strong>Different names for key columns</strong></h3>
<p>If the key columns are named differentlyfor example, <code>left</code> has <code>keyLeft</code>, and <code>right</code> has <code>keyRight</code> instead of <code>key</code>then you will have to specify <code>left_on</code> and <code>right_on</code> as arguments instead of <code>on</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">left2 = left.rename({<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'keyLeft'</span>}, axis=<span class="hljs-number">1</span>)
right2 = right.rename({<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'keyRight'</span>}, axis=<span class="hljs-number">1</span>)

</code></pre>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">left2.merge(right2, left_on=<span class="hljs-string">'keyLeft'</span>, right_on=<span class="hljs-string">'keyRight'</span>, how=<span class="hljs-string">'inner'</span>)

</code></pre>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Avoiding duplicate key column in output</strong></h3>
<p>When merging on <code>keyLeft</code> from <code>left</code> and <code>keyRight</code> from <code>right</code>, if you only want either of the <code>keyLeft</code> or <code>keyRight</code> (but not both) in the output, you can start by setting the index as a preliminary step.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">left3 = left2.set_index(<span class="hljs-string">'keyLeft'</span>)
left3.merge(right2, left_index=<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>, right_on=<span class="hljs-string">'keyRight'</span>)

    value_x keyRight   value_y
<span class="hljs-number">0</span>  <span class="hljs-number">0.400157</span>        B  <span class="hljs-number">1.867558</span>
<span class="hljs-number">1</span>  <span class="hljs-number">2.240893</span>        D -<span class="hljs-number">0.977278</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Contrast this with the output of the command just before (that is, the output of <code>left2.merge(right2, left_on='keyLeft', right_on='keyRight', how='inner')</code>), you'll notice <code>keyLeft</code> is missing. You can figure out what column to keep based on which frame's index is set as the key. This may matter when, say, performing some OUTER JOIN operation.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Merging only a single column from one of the <code>DataFrames</code></strong></h3>
<p>For example, consider</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">right3 = right.assign(newcol=np.arange(<span class="hljs-built_in">len</span>(right)))
right3
  key     value  newcol
<span class="hljs-number">0</span>   B  <span class="hljs-number">1.867558</span>       <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
<span class="hljs-number">1</span>   D -<span class="hljs-number">0.977278</span>       <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
<span class="hljs-number">2</span>   E  <span class="hljs-number">0.950088</span>       <span class="hljs-number">2</span>
<span class="hljs-number">3</span>   F -<span class="hljs-number">0.151357</span>       <span class="hljs-number">3</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If you are required to merge only "newcol" (without any of the other columns), you can usually just subset columns before merging:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">left.merge(right3[[<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'newcol'</span>]], on=<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>)

  key     value  newcol
<span class="hljs-number">0</span>   B  <span class="hljs-number">0.400157</span>       <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
<span class="hljs-number">1</span>   D  <span class="hljs-number">2.240893</span>       <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If you're doing a LEFT OUTER JOIN, a more performant solution would involve <code>map</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-comment"># left['newcol'] = left['key'].map(right3.set_index('key')['newcol']))</span>
left.assign(newcol=left[<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>].<span class="hljs-built_in">map</span>(right3.set_index(<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>)[<span class="hljs-string">'newcol'</span>]))

  key     value  newcol
<span class="hljs-number">0</span>   A  <span class="hljs-number">1.764052</span>     NaN
<span class="hljs-number">1</span>   B  <span class="hljs-number">0.400157</span>     <span class="hljs-number">0.0</span>
<span class="hljs-number">2</span>   C  <span class="hljs-number">0.978738</span>     NaN
<span class="hljs-number">3</span>   D  <span class="hljs-number">2.240893</span>     <span class="hljs-number">1.0</span>
</code></pre>
<p>As mentioned, this is similar to, but faster than</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">left.merge(right3[[<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'newcol'</span>]], on=<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>, how=<span class="hljs-string">'left'</span>)

  key     value  newcol
<span class="hljs-number">0</span>   A  <span class="hljs-number">1.764052</span>     NaN
<span class="hljs-number">1</span>   B  <span class="hljs-number">0.400157</span>     <span class="hljs-number">0.0</span>
<span class="hljs-number">2</span>   C  <span class="hljs-number">0.978738</span>     NaN
<span class="hljs-number">3</span>   D  <span class="hljs-number">2.240893</span>     <span class="hljs-number">1.0</span>
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Merging on multiple columns</strong></h3>
<p>To join on more than one column, specify a list for <code>on</code> (or <code>left_on</code> and <code>right_on</code>, as appropriate).</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">left.merge(right, on=[<span class="hljs-string">'key1'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'key2'</span>] ...)
</code></pre>
<p>Or, in the event the names are different,</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">left.merge(right, left_on=[<span class="hljs-string">'lkey1'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'lkey2'</span>], right_on=[<span class="hljs-string">'rkey1'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'rkey2'</span>])

<p>The second one, of merging dataframes from the index of one and the column of another one.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>1</strong>. <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.concat.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>pandas.concat</code></a></p>
<p>Considering the following <code>DataFrames</code> with the same column names:</p>

<p><strong>2</strong>. Merge by Column and Index</p>
<p>In this part, I will consider a specific case: If one wants to merge the index of one dataframe and the column of another dataframe.</p>
<p>Let's say one has the dataframe <code>Geo</code> with 54 columns, being one of the columns the Date <code>Data</code>, which is of type <code>datetime64[ns]</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gvSIB.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/gvSIB.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>And the dataframe <code>Price</code> that has one column with the price and the index corresponds to the dates</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dp7Jm.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Dp7Jm.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>In this specific case, to merge them, one uses <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>pd.merge</code></a></p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">merged = pd.merge(Price, Geo, left_index=<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>, right_on=<span class="hljs-string">'Data'</span>)

<p>Typically, an <strong>inner join on index</strong> would look like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">left.merge(right, left_index=<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>, right_index=<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>)

<p>Other joins follow similar syntax.</p>
<p><strong>Notable Alternatives</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.join.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>DataFrame.join</code></a></strong> defaults to joins on the index. <code>DataFrame.join</code> does a LEFT OUTER JOIN by default, so <code>how='inner'</code> is necessary here.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"> left.join(right, how=<span class="hljs-string">'inner'</span>, lsuffix=<span class="hljs-string">'_x'</span>, rsuffix=<span class="hljs-string">'_y'</span>)

 D      -<span class="hljs-number">0.524349</span>  <span class="hljs-number">0.013135</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Note that I needed to specify the <code>lsuffix</code> and <code>rsuffix</code> arguments since <code>join</code> would otherwise error out:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"> left.join(right)
 ValueError: columns overlap but no suffix specified: Index([<span class="hljs-string">'value'</span>], dtype=<span class="hljs-string">'object'</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Since the column names are the same. This would not be a problem if they were differently named.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"> left.rename(columns={<span class="hljs-string">'value'</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'leftvalue'</span>}).join(right, how=<span class="hljs-string">'inner'</span>)

 D       -<span class="hljs-number">0.524349</span>  <span class="hljs-number">0.013135</span>
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.concat.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>pd.concat</code></a></strong> joins on the index and can join two or more DataFrames at once. It does a full outer join by default, so <code>how='inner'</code> is required here..</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"> pd.concat([left, right], axis=<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, sort=<span class="hljs-literal">False</span>, join=<span class="hljs-string">'inner'</span>)

<hr>
<h3><strong>Index to Column joins</strong></h3>
<p>To perform an inner join using index of left, column of right, you will use <code>DataFrame.merge</code> a combination of <code>left_index=True</code> and <code>right_on=...</code>.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">right2 = right.reset_index().rename({<span class="hljs-string">'idxkey'</span> : <span class="hljs-string">'colkey'</span>}, axis=<span class="hljs-number">1</span>)
right2
 
  colkey     value
<span class="hljs-number">0</span>      B  <span class="hljs-number">0.543843</span>
<span class="hljs-number">1</span>      D  <span class="hljs-number">0.013135</span>
<span class="hljs-number">2</span>      E -<span class="hljs-number">0.326498</span>
<span class="hljs-number">3</span>      F  <span class="hljs-number">1.385076</span>

left.merge(right2, left_index=<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>, right_on=<span class="hljs-string">'colkey'</span>)

    value_x colkey   value_y
<span class="hljs-number">0</span> -<span class="hljs-number">0.402655</span>      B  <span class="hljs-number">0.543843</span>
<span class="hljs-number">1</span> -<span class="hljs-number">0.524349</span>      D  <span class="hljs-number">0.013135</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Other joins follow a similar structure. Note that only <code>merge</code> can perform index to column joins. You can join on multiple columns, provided the number of index levels on the left equals the number of columns on the right.</p>
<p><code>join</code> and <code>concat</code> are not capable of mixed merges. You will need to set the index as a pre-step using <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.set_index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>DataFrame.set_index</code></a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Effectively using Named Index [pandas &gt;= 0.23]</h3>
<p>If your index is named, then from pandas &gt;= 0.23, <code>DataFrame.merge</code> allows you to specify the index name to <code>on</code> (or <code>left_on</code> and <code>right_on</code> as necessary).</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">left.merge(right, on=<span class="hljs-string">'idxkey'</span>)

         value_x   value_y
idxkey                    
B      -<span class="hljs-number">0.402655</span>  <span class="hljs-number">0.543843</span>
D      -<span class="hljs-number">0.524349</span>  <span class="hljs-number">0.013135</span>
</code></pre>
<p>For the previous example of merging with the index of left, column of right, you can use <code>left_on</code> with the index name of left:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">left.merge(right2, left_on=<span class="hljs-string">'idxkey'</span>, right_on=<span class="hljs-string">'colkey'</span>)

    value_x colkey   value_y
<span class="hljs-number">0</span> -<span class="hljs-number">0.402655</span>      B  <span class="hljs-number">0.543843</span>
<span class="hljs-number">1</span> -<span class="hljs-number">0.524349</span>      D  <span class="hljs-number">0.013135</span>
</code></pre>

<h1>Generalizing to multiple DataFrames</h1>
<p>Oftentimes, the situation arises when multiple DataFrames are to be merged together. Naively, this can be done by chaining <code>merge</code> calls:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">df1.merge(df2, ...).merge(df3, ...)
</code></pre>
<p>However, this quickly gets out of hand for many DataFrames. Furthermore, it may be necessary to generalise for an unknown number of DataFrames.</p>
<p>Here I introduce <code>pd.concat</code> for multi-way joins on <em>unique</em> keys, and <code>DataFrame.join</code> for multi-way joins on <em>non-unique</em> keys. First, the setup.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-comment"># Setup.</span>
np.random.seed(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>)
A = pd.DataFrame({<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>: [<span class="hljs-string">'A'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'B'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'C'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'D'</span>], <span class="hljs-string">'valueA'</span>: np.random.randn(<span class="hljs-number">4</span>)})    
B = pd.DataFrame({<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>: [<span class="hljs-string">'B'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'D'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'E'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'F'</span>], <span class="hljs-string">'valueB'</span>: np.random.randn(<span class="hljs-number">4</span>)})
C = pd.DataFrame({<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>: [<span class="hljs-string">'D'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'E'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'J'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'C'</span>], <span class="hljs-string">'valueC'</span>: np.ones(<span class="hljs-number">4</span>)})
dfs = [A, B, C] 

<span class="hljs-comment"># Note: the "key" column values are unique, so the index is unique.</span>
A2 = A.set_index(<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>)
B2 = B.set_index(<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>)
C2 = C.set_index(<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>)

dfs2 = [A2, B2, C2]
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Multiway merge on unique keys</strong></h3>
<p>If your keys (here, the key could either be a column or an index) are unique, then you can use <code>pd.concat</code>. Note that <strong><code>pd.concat</code> joins DataFrames on the index</strong>.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-comment"># Merge on `key` column. You'll need to set the index before concatenating</span>
pd.concat(
    [df.set_index(<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> df <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> dfs], axis=<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, join=<span class="hljs-string">'inner'</span>
).reset_index()

  key    valueA    valueB  valueC
<span class="hljs-number">0</span>   D  <span class="hljs-number">2.240893</span> -<span class="hljs-number">0.977278</span>     <span class="hljs-number">1.0</span>

<span class="hljs-comment"># Merge on `key` index.</span>
pd.concat(dfs2, axis=<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, sort=<span class="hljs-literal">False</span>, join=<span class="hljs-string">'inner'</span>)

       valueA    valueB  valueC
key                            
D    <span class="hljs-number">2.240893</span> -<span class="hljs-number">0.977278</span>     <span class="hljs-number">1.0</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Omit <code>join='inner'</code> for a FULL OUTER JOIN. Note that you cannot specify LEFT or RIGHT OUTER joins (if you need these, use <code>join</code>, described below).</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>Multiway merge on keys with duplicates</strong></h3>
<p><code>concat</code> is fast, but has its shortcomings. It cannot handle duplicates.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">A3 = pd.DataFrame({<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>: [<span class="hljs-string">'A'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'B'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'C'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'D'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'D'</span>], <span class="hljs-string">'valueA'</span>: np.random.randn(<span class="hljs-number">5</span>)})
pd.concat([df.set_index(<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> df <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> [A3, B, C]], axis=<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, join=<span class="hljs-string">'inner'</span>)
</code></pre>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>ValueError: Shape of passed values is (3, 4), indices imply (3, 2)
</code></pre>
<p>In this situation, we can use <code>join</code> since it can handle non-unique keys (note that <code>join</code> joins DataFrames on their index; it calls <code>merge</code> under the hood and does a LEFT OUTER JOIN unless otherwise specified).</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-comment"># Join on `key` column. Set as the index first.</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># For inner join. For left join, omit the "how" argument.</span>
A.set_index(<span class="hljs-string">'key'</span>).join([B2, C2], how=<span class="hljs-string">'inner'</span>).reset_index()

  key    valueA    valueB  valueC
<span class="hljs-number">0</span>   D  <span class="hljs-number">2.240893</span> -<span class="hljs-number">0.977278</span>     <span class="hljs-number">1.0</span>
