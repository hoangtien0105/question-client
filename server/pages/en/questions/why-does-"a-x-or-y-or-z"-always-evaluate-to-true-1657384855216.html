<p>In many cases, Python looks and behaves like natural English, but this is one case where that abstraction fails. People can use context clues to determine that "Jon" and "Inbar" are objects joined to the verb "equals", but the Python interpreter is more literal minded.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> name == <span class="hljs-string">"Kevin"</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Jon"</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Inbar"</span>:

<p>is logically equivalent to:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (name == <span class="hljs-string">"Kevin"</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> (<span class="hljs-string">"Jon"</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> (<span class="hljs-string">"Inbar"</span>):
</code></pre>
<p>Which, for user Bob, is equivalent to:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-literal">False</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> (<span class="hljs-string">"Jon"</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> (<span class="hljs-string">"Inbar"</span>):
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>or</code> operator chooses the first argument with a positive <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing" rel="noreferrer">truth value</a>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Jon"</span>:
</code></pre>
<p>And since "Jon" has a positive truth value, the <code>if</code> block executes. That is what causes "Access granted" to be printed regardless of the name given.</p>
<p>All of this reasoning also applies to the expression <code>if "Kevin" or "Jon" or "Inbar" == name</code>. the first value, <code>"Kevin"</code>, is true, so the <code>if</code> block executes.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are two common ways to properly construct this conditional.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Use multiple <code>==</code> operators to explicitly check against each value:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> name == <span class="hljs-string">"Kevin"</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> name == <span class="hljs-string">"Jon"</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> name == <span class="hljs-string">"Inbar"</span>:
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Compose a collection of valid values (a set, a list or a tuple for example), and use the <code>in</code> operator to test for membership:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> name <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> {<span class="hljs-string">"Kevin"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Jon"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Inbar"</span>}:
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In general of the two the second should be preferred as it's easier to read and also faster:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> timeit

<hr>
<p>For those who may want proof that <code>if a == b or c or d or e: ...</code> is indeed parsed like this. The built-in <code>ast</code> module provides an answer:</p>

<h1>Summarising all existing answers</h1>
<h5>(And adding a few of my points)</h5>
<h2>Explanation :</h2>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> name == <span class="hljs-string">"Kevin"</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Jon"</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Inbar"</span>:
</code></pre>
<p>is logically equivalent to:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (name == <span class="hljs-string">"Kevin"</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> (<span class="hljs-string">"Jon"</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> (<span class="hljs-string">"Inbar"</span>):
</code></pre>
<p>Which, for user Bob, is equivalent to:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-literal">False</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> (<span class="hljs-string">"Jon"</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> (<span class="hljs-string">"Inbar"</span>):
</code></pre>
<p><strong>NOTE : Python evaluates the logical value of any non-zero integer as <code>True</code>. Therefore, all Non-empty lists, sets, strings, etc. are evaluable and return <code>True</code></strong></p>
<p>The <code>or</code> operator chooses the first argument with a positive truth value.</p>
<p>Therefore, "Jon" has a positive truth value and the if block executes, since it is now equivalent to</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-literal">False</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> (<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> (<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>):
</code></pre>
<p>That is what causes "Access granted" to be printed regardless of the name input.</p>
<h2>Solutions :</h2>
<p><strong>Solution 1 :</strong> Use multiple <code>==</code> operators to explicitly check against each value</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> name == <span class="hljs-string">"Kevin"</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> name == <span class="hljs-string">"Jon"</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> name == <span class="hljs-string">"Inbar"</span>:

<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Access denied."</span>)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Solution 2 :</strong> Compose a collection of valid values (a set, a list or a tuple for example), and use the <code>in</code> operator to test for membership <em>(faster, preferred method)</em></p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> name <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> {<span class="hljs-string">"Kevin"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Jon"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Inbar"</span>}:

<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Access denied."</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>OR</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> name <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> [<span class="hljs-string">"Kevin"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Jon"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Inbar"</span>]:

<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Access denied."</span>)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Solution 3 :</strong> Use the basic <em>(and not very efficient)</em> <code>if-elif-else</code> structure</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> name == <span class="hljs-string">"Kevin"</span>:

<p>Simple engineering problem, let's simply it a bit further.</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">In [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]: a,b,c,d=<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>,<span class="hljs-number">4</span>
In [<span class="hljs-number">2</span>]: a==b
Out[<span class="hljs-number">2</span>]: <span class="hljs-literal">False</span>
</code></pre>

<p>But, inherited from the language C, Python evaluates the logical value of a non zero integer as True.</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">In [<span class="hljs-number">11</span>]: <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-number">3</span>:
    ...:     <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> (<span class="hljs-string">"yey"</span>)
    ...:
yey
</code></pre>

<p>Now, Python builds on that logic and let you use logic literals such as or on integers, and so </p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">In [<span class="hljs-number">9</span>]: <span class="hljs-literal">False</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> <span class="hljs-number">3</span>

Out[<span class="hljs-number">4</span>]: <span class="hljs-number">3</span>

<p>The proper way to write it would be:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">In [<span class="hljs-number">13</span>]: <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> a <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> (b,c,d):

<h1>Approaches</h1>
<h2>How a data scientist approaches this problem</h2>
<p>The simplest way possible is to eliminate the need for comparison operators and use a list. This looks impressive on security systems because you learn to access ORMs.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">user = <span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Enter name: "</span>)

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> user <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> {<span class="hljs-string">"Bob"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Kevin"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Joe"</span>}:
   <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Access granted, "</span> + <span class="hljs-built_in">str</span>(user) + <span class="hljs-string">"."</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
   <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Access denied."</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Or, you can resemble the <em>exact</em> same code above, just put the list of registered users in their own list:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">user = <span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Enter name: "</span>)
users = {<span class="hljs-string">"Bob"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Kevin"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Joe"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"a million more users if you like"</span>}

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> user <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> users:
   <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Access granted, "</span> + <span class="hljs-built_in">str</span>(user) + <span class="hljs-string">"."</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
   <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Access denied."</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>If you wanted to complete this protocol safely without the risk of attack, set up double parameters. This would check your mini-ORM for <code>first</code> and <code>last</code> name fields, as well as a <code>password</code> or <code>secret question</code> key. Objects can be sorted like this if you want to efficiently lazy-load user credentials without hashing:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">lazy</span>(<span class="hljs-params">i</span>):
   j = <span class="hljs-number">0</span> <span class="hljs-comment"># For example</span>
   <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> j &lt; i:
      <span class="hljs-keyword">yield</span> j
      j += <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The loop will consume <strong>only</strong> the yielded values to save time and energy on your system:</p>
<p>You can then do something with the iterated list:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> j <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> lazy_range(<span class="hljs-number">10</span>):
   do_something_here(j)
</code></pre>
<p>This problem can be approached from any angle: memory management, security, or simply by an organic list or packaged ORM.</p>

This question should not be closed as a duplicate of that one as this problem is encountered by newcomers to Python who might have difficulties applying the knowledge from the reversed question to their problem.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","slug":"why-does-\"a-x-or-y-or-z\"-always-evaluate-to-true-1657384855216","postType":"QUESTION","createdAt":"2022-07-09T16:40:55.000Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-09T16:40:55.000Z","tags":[{"id":636,"name":"boolean","slug":"boolean","createdAt":"2022-07-09T16:40:55.000Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-09T16:40:55.000Z","Questions_Tags":{"questionId":173,"tagId":636}},{"id":637,"name":"boolean-expression","slug":"boolean-expression","createdAt":"2022-07-09T16:40:55.000Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-09T16:40:55.000Z","Questions_Tags":{"questionId":173,"tagId":637}}],"relatedQuestions":[{"title":"Why does \"a == x or y or z\" always evaluate to True?","slug":"why-does-\"a-x-or-y-or-z\"-always-evaluate-to-true-1657384855216","tags":[{"name":"boolean","Questions_Tags":{"questionId":173,"tagId":636}},{"name":"boolean-expression","Questions_Tags":{"questionId":173,"tagId":637}}]}]},"randomQuestions":[{"title":"HTTP GET with request body","slug":"http-get-with-request-body-1657387379038"},{"title":"Make a div fill the height of the remaining screen space","slug":"make-a-div-fill-the-height-of-the-remaining-screen-space-1657387482387"},{"title":"How do I add a delay in a JavaScript loop?","slug":"how-do-i-add-a-delay-in-a-javascript-loop-1657388544679"},{"title":"What is the JavaScript version of sleep()?","slug":"what-is-the-javascript-version-of-sleep()-1657387391406"},{"title":"My regex is matching too much.
