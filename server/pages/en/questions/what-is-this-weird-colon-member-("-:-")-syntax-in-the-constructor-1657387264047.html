This is because compilers do not warn if the two orders are different but a relatively new user might confuse member Initializer list as the order of initialization and write some code dependent on that.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"It&apos;s a member initialization list.

This syntax lets you to custom-initialize base subobjects and member subobjects of the class (as opposed to allowing them to default-initialize or to remain uninitialized).\n\nI just want to note that the syntax that, as you said, &quot;looks like a constructor call&quot;, is not necessarily a constructor call. In C++ language the () syntax is just one standard form of initialization syntax. It is interpreted differently for different types. For class types with user-defined constructor it means one thing (it is indeed a constructor call), for class types without user-defined constructor it means another thing (so called value initialization ) for empty ()) and for non-class types it again means something different (since non-class types have no constructors).\n\nIn your case the data member has type int. int is not a class type, so it has no constructor. For type int this syntax means simply &quot;initialize bar with the value of num&quot; and that&apos;s it.

</code></pre>
<p>There is a significant difference between Initializing a member using Member initializer list and assigning it an value inside the constructor body.</p>
<p>When you <em><strong>initialize</strong></em> fields via Member initializer list the constructors will be called once and the object will be constructed and initialized in one operation.</p>
<p>If you use <em><strong>assignment</strong></em> then the fields will be first initialized with default constructors and then reassigned (via assignment operator) with actual values.</p>
<p>As you see there is an additional overhead of creation &amp; assignment in the latter, which might be considerable for user defined classes.</p>
<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp">Cost of Member Initialization = Object Construction 
Cost of Member Assignment = Object Construction + Assignment
</code></pre>
<p>The latter is actually equivalent to:</p>
<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-built_in">Foo</span>(<span class="hljs-type">int</span> num) : <span class="hljs-built_in">bar</span>() {bar = num;}
</code></pre>
<p>While the former is equivalent to just:</p>
<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-built_in">Foo</span>(<span class="hljs-type">int</span> num): <span class="hljs-built_in">bar</span>(num){}
</code></pre>
<p>For an inbuilt (your code example) or POD class members there is no practical overhead.</p>

<h2>Important points to Note while using Member Initializer Lists:</h2>
<p><strong>Class Member variables are always initialized in the order in which they are declared in the class.</strong></p>
<p>They are <strong>not</strong> initialized in the order in which they are specified in the Member Initializer List.<br>
In short, Member initialization list does not determine the order of initialization.</p>
<p>Given the above it is always a good practice to maintain the same order of members for Member initialization as the order in which they are declared in the class definition. This is because compilers do not warn if the two orders are different but a relatively new user might confuse member Initializer list as the order of initialization and write some code dependent on that.</p>

<p>The other already explained to you that the syntax that you observe is called "constructor initializer list". This syntax lets you to custom-initialize base subobjects and member subobjects of the class (as opposed to allowing them to default-initialize or to remain uninitialized).</p>

<p>I just want to note that the syntax that, as you said, "looks like a constructor call", is not necessarily a constructor call. In C++ language the <code>()</code> syntax is just one standard form of <em>initialization syntax</em>. It is interpreted differently for different types. For class types with user-defined constructor it means one thing (it is indeed a constructor call), for class types without user-defined constructor it means another thing (so called <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/value_initialization" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong><em>value initialization</em></strong></a> ) for empty <code>()</code>) and for non-class types it again means something different (since non-class types have no constructors).</p>

<p>In your case the data member has type <code>int</code>. <code>int</code> is not a class type, so it has no constructor. For type <code>int</code> this syntax means simply "initialize <code>bar</code> with the value of <code>num</code>" and that's it. It is done just like that, directly, no constructors involved, since, once again, <code>int</code> is not a class type of therefore it can't have any constructors.</p>

Instead of default constructing <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> and then assigning them the values received in the parameters, those members will be initialized with those values right off the bat.
