<p>As suggested: <code>1i</code> and <code>ii</code> are recommended. However, though these are both fine deviations from <code>i</code>, it is not very nice to use both of these alternatives together.</p>
<p>Here is an example why (personally) I don't like it:</p>
<pre class="lang-matlab s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-matlab">val2 = val + <span class="hljs-built_in">i</span>  <span class="hljs-comment">% 1</span>
val2 = val + ii <span class="hljs-comment">% 2</span>
val2 = val + <span class="hljs-number">1</span><span class="hljs-built_in">i</span> <span class="hljs-comment">% 3</span>
</code></pre>
<p>One will not easily be misread for two or three, but two and three resemble each other.</p>
<p>Therefore my personal recommendation would be: In case you sometimes work with complex code, always use <code>1i</code> combined with a different loop variable.</p>
<p>Examples of single letter indices that for if you don't use many loop variables and letters suffice: <code>t</code>,<code>u</code>,<code>k</code> and <code>p</code></p>
<p>Example of longer indices: <code>i_loop</code>,<code>step</code>,<code>walk</code>, and <code>t_now</code></p>
<p>Of course this is a matter of personal taste as well, but it should not be hard to find indices to use that have a clear meaning without growing too long.</p>

<p>It was pointed out that <code>1i</code> is an acceptable and unambiguous way to write <code>sqrt(-1)</code>, and that as such there is no need to avoid using <code>i</code>. Then again, as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14790740/using-i-and-j-as-variables-in-matlab/14893729#14893729">Dennis pointed out</a>, it can be hard to see the difference between <code>1i</code> and <code>ii</code>. My suggestion: use <code>1j</code> as the imaginary constant where possible. It's the same trick that electrical engineers employ - they use <code>j</code> for <code>sqrt(-1)</code> because <code>i</code> is already taken for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current" rel="nofollow noreferrer">current</a>.</p>
<p>Personally I never use <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>; I use <code>ii</code> and <code>jj</code> as shorthand indexing variables, (and kk, ll, mm, ...) and <code>1j</code> when I need to use complex numbers.</p>

<p>Confusion with the imaginary unit has been well covered here, but there are some other more prosaic reasons why these and other single-letter variable names are sometimes discouraged.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>MATLAB specifically: if you're using coder to generate C++ source from your MATLAB code (don't, it's horrible) then you are explicitly warned not to reuse variables because of potential typing clashes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Generally, and depending on your IDE, a single-letter variable name can cause havoc with highlighters and search/replace. MATLAB doesn't suffer from this and I believe Visual Studio hasn't had a problem for some time, but the C/C++ coding standards like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MISRA_C" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MISRA</a>, etc. tend to advise against them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For my part I avoid all single-letter variables, despite the obvious advantages for directly implementing mathematical sources. It takes a little extra effort the first few hundred times you do it, but after that you stop noticing, and the advantages when you or some other poor soul come to read your code are legion.</p>

<p>Any non-trivial code contains multiple <code>for</code> loops, and the best practices recommend you use a descriptive name indicative of its purpose and scope. For times immemorial (and unless its 5-10 lines script that I am not going to save),  I have always been using variable names like <code>idxTask</code>, <code>idxAnotherTask</code> and <code>idxSubTask</code> etc. </p>

<p>Or at the very least doubling the first letter of the array it is indexing e.g. <code>ss</code> to index <code>subjectList</code>, <code>tt</code> to index <code>taskList</code>, but not <code>ii</code> or <code>jj</code> which doesn't help me effortlessly identify which array they are indexing out of my multiple for loops.</p>

<p>Unless you are a very confused user I think there is very little risk in using variable names <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> and I use them regularly. I haven't seen any official indication that this practice should be avoided.</p>

<p>While it's true that shadowing the imaginary unit could cause some confusion in some context as mentioned in other posts, overall I simply don't see it as a major issue. There are far more confusing things you can do in MATLAB, take for instance defining <code>false=true</code></p>

<p><strong>In my opinion the only time you should probably avoid them is if your code specifically deals with imaginary numbers.</strong></p>
