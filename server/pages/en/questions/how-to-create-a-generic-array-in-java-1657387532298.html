GenSet knows explicitly what type of objects it contains (i.e. its constructor was explicitly called with a Class&lt;E&gt; argument, and methods will throw an exception when they are passed arguments that are not of type E. See Collections.checkedCollection.\n\n-&gt; in that case, you should write:\n\npublic class GenSet&lt;E&gt; {\n\n    private E[] a;\n\n    public GenSet(Class&lt;E&gt; c, int s) {\n        // Use Array native method to create array\n        // of a type only known at run time\n        @SuppressWarnings(&quot;unchecked&quot;)\n        final E[] a = (E[]) Array.newInstance(c, s);\n        this.a = a;\n    }\n\n    E get(int i) {\n        return a[i];\n    }\n}\n\nUnchecked: weak typing. No type checking is actually done on any of the objects passed as argument.\n\n-&gt; in that case, you should write\n\npublic class GenSet&lt;E&gt; {\n\n    private Object[] a;\n\n    public GenSet(int s) {\n        a = new Object[s];\n    }\n\n    E get(int i) {\n        @SuppressWarnings(&quot;unchecked&quot;)\n        final E e = (E) a[i];\n        return e;\n    }\n}\n\n\nNote that the component type of the array should be the erasure of the type parameter:\n\npublic class GenSet&lt;E extends Foo&gt; { // E has an upper bound of Foo\n\n    private Foo[] a; // E erases to Foo, so use Foo[]\n\n    public GenSet(int s) {\n        a = new Foo[s];\n    }\n\n    ...\n}\n\n\n\nAll of this results from a known, and deliberate, weakness of generics in Java: it was implemented using erasure, so &quot;generic&quot; classes don&apos;t know what type argument they were created with at run time, and therefore can not provide type-safety unless some explicit mechanism (type-checking) is implemented.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You can do this:\n\nE[] arr = (E[])new Object[INITIAL_ARRAY_LENGTH];\n\n\nThis is one of the suggested ways of implementing a generic collection in Effective Java; Item 26.  No type errors, no need to cast the array repeatedly.  However this triggers a warning because it is potentially dangerous, and should be used with caution.  As detailed in the comments, this Object[] is now masquerading as our E[] type, and can cause unexpected errors or ClassCastExceptions if used unsafely.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, this behavior is safe as long as the cast array is used internally (e.g. to back a data structure), and not returned or exposed to client code.  Should you need to return an array of a generic type to other code, the reflection Array class you mention is the right way to go.\n\n\n\nWorth mentioning that wherever possible, you&apos;ll have a much happier time working with Lists rather than arrays if you&apos;re using generics.  Certainly sometimes you don&apos;t have a choice, but using the collections framework is far more robust.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Here&apos;s how to use generics to get an array of precisely the type youre looking for while preserving type safety (as opposed to the other answers, which will either give you back an Object array or result in warnings at compile time):\n\nimport java.lang.reflect.Array;  \n\npublic class GenSet&lt;E&gt; {  \n    private E[] a;  \n\n    public GenSet(Class&lt;E[]&gt; clazz, int length) {  \n        a = clazz.cast(Array.newInstance(clazz.getComponentType(), length));  \n    }  \n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {  \n        GenSet&lt;String&gt; foo = new GenSet&lt;String&gt;(String[].class, 1);  \n        String[] bar = foo.a;  \n        foo.a[0] = &quot;xyzzy&quot;;  \n        String baz = foo.a[0];  \n    }  \n}\n\n\nThat compiles without warnings, and as you can see in main, for whatever type you declare an instance of GenSet as, you can assign a to an array of that type, and you can assign an element from a to a variable of that type, meaning that the array and the values in the array are of the correct type.\n\nIt works by using class literals as runtime type tokens, as discussed in the Java Tutorials. Class literals are treated by the compiler as instances of java.lang.Class. To use one, simply follow the name of a class with .class. So, String.class acts as a Class object representing the class String. This also works for interfaces, enums, any-dimensional arrays (e.g. String[].class), primitives (e.g. int.class), and the keyword void (i.e. void.class). \n\nClass itself is generic (declared as Class&lt;T&gt;, where T stands for the type that the Class object is representing), meaning that the type of String.class is Class&lt;String&gt;.\n\nSo, whenever you call the constructor for GenSet, you pass in a class literal for the first argument representing an array of the GenSet instance&apos;s declared type (e.g. String[].class for GenSet&lt;String&gt;). Note that you won&apos;t be able to get an array of primitives, since primitives can&apos;t be used for type variables.\n\nInside the constructor, calling the method cast returns the passed Object argument cast to the class represented by the Class object on which the method was called. Calling the static method newInstance in java.lang.reflect.Array returns as an Object an array of the type represented by the Class object passed as the first argument and of the length specified by the int passed as the second argument. Calling the method getComponentType returns a Class object representing the component type of the array represented by the Class object on which the method was called (e.g. String.class for String[].class, null if the Class object doesn&apos;t represent an array).\n\nThat last sentence isn&apos;t entirely accurate. Calling String[].class.getComponentType() returns a Class object representing the class String, but its type is Class&lt;?&gt;, not Class&lt;String&gt;, which is why you can&apos;t do something like the following.\n\nString foo = String[].class.getComponentType().cast(&quot;bar&quot;); // won&apos;t compile\n\n\nSame goes for every method in Class that returns a Class object.\n\nRegarding Joachim Sauer&apos;s comment on this answer (I don&apos;t have enough reputation to comment on it myself), the example using the cast to T[] will result in a warning because the compiler can&apos;t guarantee type safety in that case.\n\n\n\nEdit regarding Ingo&apos;s comments:\n\npublic static &lt;T&gt; T[] newArray(Class&lt;T[]&gt; type, int size) {\n   return type.cast(Array.newInstance(type.getComponentType(), size));\n}\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"This is the only answer that is type safe\n\nE[] a;\n\na = newArray(size);\n\n@SafeVarargs\nstatic &lt;E&gt; E[] newArray(int length, E... array)\n{\n    return Arrays.copyOf(array, length);\n}\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"To extend to more dimensions, just add []&apos;s and dimension parameters to newInstance() (T is a type parameter, cls is a Class&lt;T&gt;, d1 through d5 are integers):\n\nT[] array = (T[])Array.newInstance(cls, d1);\nT[][] array = (T[][])Array.newInstance(cls, d1, d2);\nT[][][] array = (T[][][])Array.newInstance(cls, d1, d2, d3);\nT[][][][] array = (T[][][][])Array.newInstance(cls, d1, d2, d3, d4);\nT[][][][][] array = (T[][][][][])Array.newInstance(cls, d1, d2, d3, d4, d5);\n\n\nSee Array.newInstance() for details.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"In Java 8, we can do a kind of generic array creation using a lambda or method reference.

<p>Due to the implementation of Java generics, you can't have code like this: </p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">GenSet</span>&lt;E&gt; {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> E a[];

    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">GenSet</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> {
        a = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">E</span>[INITIAL_ARRAY_LENGTH]; <span class="hljs-comment">// error: generic array creation</span>
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>How can I implement this while maintaining type safety?</p>

<p>I saw a solution on the Java forums that goes like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> java.lang.reflect.Array;

<span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Stack</span>&lt;T&gt; {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">Stack</span><span class="hljs-params">(Class&lt;T&gt; clazz, <span class="hljs-type">int</span> capacity)</span> {
        array = (T[])Array.newInstance(clazz, capacity);
    }

    <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">final</span> T[] array;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But I really don't get what's going on.</p>

<p>I have to ask a question in return: is your <code>GenSet</code> "checked" or "unchecked"?
What does that mean?</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Checked</strong>: <em>strong typing</em>. <code>GenSet</code> knows explicitly what type of objects it contains (i.e. its constructor was explicitly called with a <code>Class&lt;E&gt;</code> argument, and methods will throw an exception when they are passed arguments that are not of type <code>E</code>. See <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#checkedCollection%28java.util.Collection,%20java.lang.Class%29" rel="noreferrer"><code>Collections.checkedCollection</code></a>.</p>

<p>-&gt; in that case, you should write:</p>

<li><p><strong>Unchecked</strong>: <em>weak typing</em>. No type checking is actually done on any of the objects passed as argument.</p>

<p>-&gt; in that case, you should write</p>

}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the component type of the array should be the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/erasure.html" rel="noreferrer"><em>erasure</em></a> of the type parameter:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">GenSet</span>&lt;E <span class="hljs-keyword">extends</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Foo</span>&gt; { <span class="hljs-comment">// E has an upper bound of Foo</span>

    }

    ...
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>All of this results from a known, and deliberate, weakness of generics in Java: it was implemented using erasure, so "generic" classes don't know what type argument they were created with at run time, and therefore can not provide type-safety unless some explicit mechanism (type-checking) is implemented.</p>

<p>This is one of the suggested ways of implementing a generic collection in <em>Effective Java; Item 26</em>.  No type errors, no need to cast the array repeatedly.  <em>However</em> this triggers a warning because it is potentially dangerous, and should be used with caution.  As detailed in the comments, this <code>Object[]</code> is now masquerading as our <code>E[]</code> type, and can cause unexpected errors or <code>ClassCastException</code>s if used unsafely.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, this behavior is safe as long as the cast array is used internally (e.g. to back a data structure), and not returned or exposed to client code.  Should you need to return an array of a generic type to other code, the reflection <code>Array</code> class you mention is the right way to go.</p>

<hr>

<p>Worth mentioning that wherever possible, you'll have a much happier time working with <code>List</code>s rather than arrays if you're using generics.  Certainly sometimes you don't have a choice, but using the collections framework is far more robust.</p>

<p>Here's how to use generics to get an array of precisely the type youre looking for while preserving type safety (as opposed to the other answers, which will either give you back an <code>Object</code> array or result in warnings at compile time):</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> java.lang.reflect.Array;  

<span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">GenSet</span>&lt;E&gt; {  
    <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> E[] a;

        a = clazz.cast(Array.newInstance(clazz.getComponentType(), length));  
    }  

    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">main</span><span class="hljs-params">(String[] args)</span> {  
        GenSet&lt;String&gt; foo = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">GenSet</span>&lt;String&gt;(String[].class, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>);  
        String[] bar = foo.a;  
        foo.a[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">"xyzzy"</span>;  
        <span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">baz</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> foo.a[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>];  
    }  
}
</code></pre>

<p>That compiles without warnings, and as you can see in <code>main</code>, for whatever type you declare an instance of <code>GenSet</code> as, you can assign <code>a</code> to an array of that type, and you can assign an element from <code>a</code> to a variable of that type, meaning that the array and the values in the array are of the correct type.</p>

<p>It works by using class literals as runtime type tokens, as discussed in the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/generics/literals.html" rel="noreferrer">Java Tutorials</a>. Class literals are treated by the compiler as instances of <code>java.lang.Class</code>. To use one, simply follow the name of a class with <code>.class</code>. So, <code>String.class</code> acts as a <code>Class</code> object representing the class <code>String</code>. This also works for interfaces, enums, any-dimensional arrays (e.g. <code>String[].class</code>), primitives (e.g. <code>int.class</code>), and the keyword <code>void</code> (i.e. <code>void.class</code>). </p>

<p><code>Class</code> itself is generic (declared as <code>Class&lt;T&gt;</code>, where <code>T</code> stands for the type that the <code>Class</code> object is representing), meaning that the type of <code>String.class</code> is <code>Class&lt;String&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>So, whenever you call the constructor for <code>GenSet</code>, you pass in a class literal for the first argument representing an array of the <code>GenSet</code> instance's declared type (e.g. <code>String[].class</code> for <code>GenSet&lt;String&gt;</code>). Note that you won't be able to get an array of primitives, since primitives can't be used for type variables.</p>

<p>Inside the constructor, calling the method <code>cast</code> returns the passed <code>Object</code> argument cast to the class represented by the <code>Class</code> object on which the method was called. Calling the static method <code>newInstance</code> in <code>java.lang.reflect.Array</code> returns as an <code>Object</code> an array of the type represented by the <code>Class</code> object passed as the first argument and of the length specified by the <code>int</code> passed as the second argument. Calling the method <code>getComponentType</code> returns a <code>Class</code> object representing the component type of the array represented by the <code>Class</code> object on which the method was called (e.g. <code>String.class</code> for <code>String[].class</code>, <code>null</code> if the <code>Class</code> object doesn't represent an array).</p>

<p>That last sentence isn't entirely accurate. Calling <code>String[].class.getComponentType()</code> returns a <code>Class</code> object representing the class <code>String</code>, but its type is <code>Class&lt;?&gt;</code>, not <code>Class&lt;String&gt;</code>, which is why you can't do something like the following.</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">foo</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> String[].class.getComponentType().cast(<span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// won't compile</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Same goes for every method in <code>Class</code> that returns a <code>Class</code> object.</p>

<p>Regarding Joachim Sauer's comment on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/529085/java-how-to-generic-array-creation/529094#529094">this answer</a> (I don't have enough reputation to comment on it myself), the example using the cast to <code>T[]</code> will result in a warning because the compiler can't guarantee type safety in that case.</p>

<p>The public <code>Stack(Class&lt;T&gt; clazz,int capacity)</code> constructor requires you to pass a Class object at run time, which means class information <em>is</em> available at runtime to code that needs it. And the <code>Class&lt;T&gt;</code> form means that the compiler will check that the Class object you pass is precisely the Class object for type T. Not a subclass of T, not a superclass of T, but precisely T.</p>

<p>This then means that you can create an array object of the appropriate type in your constructor, which means that the type of the objects you store in your collection will have their types checked at the point they are added to the collection.</p>

<p>I have found a quick and easy way that works for me. Note that i have only used this on Java JDK 8. I don't know if it will work with previous versions.</p>

<p>Although we cannot instantiate a generic array of a specific type parameter, we can pass an already created array to a generic class constructor.</p>

    GenArray(T[] arr) {
        theArray = arr;
    }

    <span class="hljs-comment">// Do whatever with the array...</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now in main we can create the array like so:</p>

<p>No one else has answered the question of what is going on in the example you posted.</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> java.lang.reflect.Array;

<span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Stack</span>&lt;T&gt; {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">Stack</span><span class="hljs-params">(Class&lt;T&gt; clazz, <span class="hljs-type">int</span> capacity)</span> {
        array = (T[])Array.newInstance(clazz, capacity);
    }

    <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">final</span> T[] array;

</code></pre>

<p>As others have said generics are "erased" during compilation. So at runtime an instance of a generic doesn't know what its component type is. The reason for this is historical, Sun wanted to add generics without breaking the existing interface (both source and binary).</p>

<p>Arrays on the other hand <em>do</em> know their component type at runtime.</p>

<p>This example works around the problem by having the code that calls the constructor (which does know the type) pass a parameter telling the class the required type.</p>

<p>So the application would construct the class with something like</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">Stack&lt;foo&gt; = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Stack</span>&lt;foo&gt;(foo.class,<span class="hljs-number">50</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>and the constructor now knows (at runtime) what the component type is and can use that information to construct the array through the reflection API.</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">Array.newInstance(clazz, capacity);
</code></pre>

<p>Finally we have a type cast because the compiler has no way of knowing that the array returned by <code>Array#newInstance()</code> is the correct type (even though we know).</p>

<p>This style is a bit ugly but it can sometimes be the least bad solution to creating generic types that do need to know their component type at runtime for whatever reason (creating arrays, or creating instances of their component type, etc.).</p>

<p>You can expose people in the class PersonList thru a getter. The line below will give you an array, that has a <code>List&lt;Person&gt;</code> in every element. In other words array of <code>List&lt;Person&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Edit: Perhaps an alternate way of creating such an array, if the size you required was known and small, would be to simply feed the required number of "null"s into the zeroArray command?</p>

<p>Though obviously this isn't as versatile as using the createArray code.</p>

<p>I actually found a pretty unique solution to bypass the inability to initiate a generic array. What you have to do is create a class that takes in the generic variable T like so:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">GenericInvoker</span> &lt;T&gt; {
    T variable;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">GenericInvoker</span><span class="hljs-params">(T variable)</span>{
        <span class="hljs-built_in">this</span>.variable = variable;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then in your array class just have it start like so:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">GenericInvoker&lt;T&gt;[] array;
<span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">MyArray</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>{
    array = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">GenericInvoker</span>[];
}
</code></pre>

<p>starting a <code>new Generic Invoker[]</code> will cause an issue with unchecked but there shouldn't actually be any issues.</p>

<p>To get from the array you should call the array[i].variable like so:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> T <span class="hljs-title function_">get</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-type">int</span> index)</span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> array[index].variable;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The rest, such as resizing the array can be done with Arrays.copyOf() like so:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">resize</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-type">int</span> newSize)</span>{
    array = Arrays.copyOf(array, newSize);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the add function can be added like so:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-type">boolean</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">add</span><span class="hljs-params">(T element)</span>{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// the variable size below is equal to how many times the add function has been called </span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// and is used to keep track of where to put the next variable in the array</span>
    arrays[size] = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">GenericInvoker</span>(element);
    size++;
}
</code></pre>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution30" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl solution-inner border md:px-10 md:py-10 px-2 py-10 shadow-md bg-white"><div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-between"><h1 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 30</h1><div class="tags-wrap h-max space-x-8"><div class="tags"><a class="rounded-2xl border bg-neutral-100 px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold whitespace-nowrap" href="/questions/tag/instantiation">instantiation</a></div></div></div><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>If you really want to wrap a generic array of fixed size you will have a method to add data to that array, hence you can initialize properly the array there doing something like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> java.lang.reflect.Array;

<span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Stack</span>&lt;T&gt; {

    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">push</span><span class="hljs-params">(T value)</span> {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (value == <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>)

        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (array == <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>)
            array = (T[]) Array.newInstance(value.getClass(), capacity);
        <span class="hljs-comment">// put logic: e.g.</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(pos == capacity)
             <span class="hljs-keyword">throw</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">IllegalStateException</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"push on full stack"</span>);
        array[pos++] = value;
    }

    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> T <span class="hljs-title function_">pop</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">throws</span> IllegalStateException {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (pos == <span class="hljs-number">0</span>)

        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> array[--pos];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>in this case you use a java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance to create the array, and it will not be an Object[], but a real T[].
You should not worry of it not being final, since it is managed inside your class.
Note that you need a non null object on the push() to be able to get the type to use, so I added a check on the data you push and throw an exception there.</p>

<p>Still this is somewhat pointless: you store data via push and it is the signature of the method that guarantees only T elements will enter. So it is more or less irrelevant that the array is Object[] or T[].</p>

No type errors, no need to cast the array repeatedly.  \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;However\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; this triggers a warning because it is potentially dangerous, and should be used with caution.  As detailed in the comments, this \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Object[]\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is now masquerading as our \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;E[]\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; type, and can cause unexpected errors or \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ClassCastException\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;s if used unsafely.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;As a rule of thumb, this behavior is safe as long as the cast array is used internally (e.g. to back a data structure), and not returned or exposed to client code.  Should you need to return an array of a generic type to other code, the reflection \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Array\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; class you mention is the right way to go.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Worth mentioning that wherever possible, you\u0026apos;ll have a much happier time working with \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;List\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;s rather than arrays if you\u0026apos;re using generics.

Class literals are treated by the compiler as instances of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;java.lang.Class\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. To use one, simply follow the name of a class with \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;.class\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.

This also works for interfaces, enums, any-dimensional arrays (e.g. \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;String[].class\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;), primitives (e.g. \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;int.class\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;), and the keyword \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;void\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; (i.e. \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;void.class\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;). \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Class\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; itself is generic (declared as \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Class\u0026amp;lt;T\u0026amp;gt;\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, where \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;T\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; stands for the type that the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Class\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; object is representing), meaning that the type of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;String.class\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Class\u0026amp;lt;String\u0026amp;gt;\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So, whenever you call the constructor for \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;GenSet\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, you pass in a class literal for the first argument representing an array of the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;GenSet\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; instance\u0026apos;s declared type (e.g. \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;String[].class\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; for \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;GenSet\u0026amp;lt;String\u0026amp;gt;\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;). Note that you won\u0026apos;t be able to get an array of primitives, since primitives can\u0026apos;t be used for type variables.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Inside the constructor, calling the method \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;cast\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; returns the passed \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Object\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; argument cast to the class represented by the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Class\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; object on which the method was called.
