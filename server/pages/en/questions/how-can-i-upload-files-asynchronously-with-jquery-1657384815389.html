Not only that, you can do file validations (name, size, and MIME type) or handle the progress event with the HTML5 progress tag (or a div). Recently I had to make a file uploader, but I didn&apos;t want to use Flash nor Iframes or plugins and after some research I came up with the solution.\n\nThe HTML:\n\n&lt;form enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;input name=&quot;file&quot; type=&quot;file&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;input type=&quot;button&quot; value=&quot;Upload&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;progress&gt;&lt;/progress&gt;\n\n\nFirst, you can do some validation if you want. For example, in the .on(&apos;change&apos;) event of the file:\n\n$(&apos;:file&apos;).on(&apos;change&apos;, function () {\n  var file = this.files[0];\n\n  if (file.size &gt; 1024) {\n    alert(&apos;max upload size is 1k&apos;);\n  }\n\n  // Also see .name, .type\n});\n\n\nNow the $.ajax() submit with the button&apos;s click:\n\n$(&apos;:button&apos;).on(&apos;click&apos;, function () {\n  $.ajax({\n    // Your server script to process the upload\n    url: &apos;upload.php&apos;,\n    type: &apos;POST&apos;,\n\n    // Form data\n    data: new FormData($(&apos;form&apos;)[0]),\n\n    // Tell jQuery not to process data or worry about content-type\n    // You *must* include these options!\n    cache: false,\n    contentType: false,\n    processData: false,\n\n    // Custom XMLHttpRequest\n    xhr: function () {\n      var myXhr = $.ajaxSettings.xhr();\n      if (myXhr.upload) {\n        // For handling the progress of the upload\n        myXhr.upload.addEventListener(&apos;progress&apos;, function (e) {\n          if (e.lengthComputable) {\n            $(&apos;progress&apos;).attr({\n              value: e.loaded,\n              max: e.total,\n            });\n          }\n        }, false);\n      }\n      return myXhr;\n    }\n  });\n});\n\n\nAs you can see, with HTML5 (and some research) file uploading not only becomes possible but super easy. Try it with Google Chrome as some of the HTML5 components of the examples aren&apos;t available in every browser.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"2019 Update: It still depends on the browsers your demographic uses.\nAn important thing to understand with the &quot;new&quot; HTML5 file API is that it wasn&apos;t supported until IE 10. If the specific market you&apos;re aiming at has a higher-than-average propensity toward older versions of Windows, you might not have access to it.\nAs of 2017, about 5% of browsers are one of IE 6, 7, 8 or 9. If you head into a big corporation (e.g., this is a B2B tool or something you&apos;re delivering for training) that number can skyrocket. In 2016, I dealt with a company using IE8 on over 60% of their machines.\nIt&apos;s 2019 as of this edit, almost 11 years after my initial answer. IE9 and lower are globally around the 1% mark but there are still clusters of higher usage.\nThe important take-away from this whatever the feature is, check what browser your users use. If you don&apos;t, you&apos;ll learn a quick and painful lesson in why &quot;works for me&quot; isn&apos;t good enough in a deliverable to a client. caniuse is a useful tool but note where they get their demographics from. They may not align with yours. This is never truer than enterprise environments.\nMy answer from 2008 follows.\n\nHowever, there are viable non-JS methods of file uploads. You can create an iframe on the page (that you hide with CSS) and then target your form to post to that iframe. The main page doesn&apos;t need to move.\nIt&apos;s a &quot;real&quot; post so it&apos;s not wholly interactive. If you need status you need something server-side to process that. This varies massively depending on your server. ASP.NET has nicer mechanisms. PHP plain fails, but you can use Perl or Apache modifications to get around it.\nIf you need multiple file uploads, it&apos;s best to do each file one at a time (to overcome maximum file upload limits). Post the first form to the iframe, monitor its progress using the above and when it has finished, post the second form to the iframe, and so on.\nOr use a Java/Flash solution. They&apos;re a lot more flexible in what they can do with their posts...\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I recommend using the Fine Uploader plugin for this purpose. Your JavaScript code would be:\n\n$(document).ready(function() {\n  $(&quot;#uploadbutton&quot;).jsupload({\n    action: &quot;addFile.do&quot;,\n    onComplete: function(response){\n      alert( &quot;server response: &quot; + response);\n    }\n  });\n});\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Note: This answer is outdated, it is now possible to upload files using XHR.\n\n\n\nYou cannot upload files using XMLHttpRequest (Ajax).

When the user submits a request is made and the files are uploaded but the response is displayed inside the iframe instead of re-rendering the main page. Hiding the iframe makes the whole process transparent to the user and emulates an asynchronous request.\n\nIf done properly it should work virtually on any browser, but it has some caveats as how to obtain the response from the iframe. \n\nIn this case you may prefer to use a wrapper plugin like Bifröst which uses the iframe technique but also provides a jQuery Ajax transport allowing to send files with just the $.ajax() method like this:\n\n$.ajax({\n  url: &apos;file/destination.html&apos;, \n  type: &apos;POST&apos;,\n  // Set the transport to use (iframe means to use Bifröst)\n  // and the expected data type (json in this case).\n  dataType: &apos;iframe json&apos;,                                \n  fileInputs: $(&apos;input[type=&quot;file&quot;]&apos;),  // The file inputs containing the files to send.\n  data: { msg: &apos;Some extra data you might need.&apos;}\n}).done(function(){\n  console.log(&quot;Success: Files sent!&quot;);\n}).fail(function(){\n  console.log(&quot;An error occurred, the files couldn&apos;t be sent!&quot;);\n});\n\n\nPlugins\n\nBifröst is just a small wrapper that adds fallback support to jQuery&apos;s ajax method, but many of the aforementioned plugins like jQuery Form Plugin or jQuery File Upload include the whole stack from HTML5 to different fallbacks and some useful features to ease out the process. Depending on your needs and requirements you might want to consider a bare implementation or either of this plugins.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"This AJAX file upload jQuery plugin uploads the file somehwere, and passes the\nresponse to a callback, nothing else. \n\n\nIt does not depend on specific HTML, just give it a &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;\nIt does not require your server to respond in any particular way\nIt does not matter how many files you use, or where they are on the page\n\n\n-- Use as little as --\n\n$(&apos;#one-specific-file&apos;).ajaxfileupload({\n  &apos;action&apos;: &apos;/upload.php&apos;\n});\n\n\n-- or as much as --\n\n$(&apos;input[type=&quot;file&quot;]&apos;).ajaxfileupload({\n  &apos;action&apos;: &apos;/upload.php&apos;,\n  &apos;params&apos;: {\n    &apos;extra&apos;: &apos;info&apos;\n  },\n  &apos;onComplete&apos;: function(response) {\n    console.log(&apos;custom handler for file:&apos;);\n    alert(JSON.stringify(response));\n  },\n  &apos;onStart&apos;: function() {\n    if(weWantedTo) return false; // cancels upload\n  },\n  &apos;onCancel&apos;: function() {\n    console.log(&apos;no file selected&apos;);\n  }\n});\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution6","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I have been using the below script to upload images which happens to work fine.\n\nHTML\n\n&lt;input id=&quot;file&quot; type=&quot;file&quot; name=&quot;file&quot;/&gt;\n&lt;div id=&quot;response&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nJavaScript\n\njQuery(&apos;document&apos;).ready(function(){\n    var input = document.getElementById(&quot;file&quot;);\n    var formdata = false;\n    if (window.FormData) {\n        formdata = new FormData();\n    }\n    input.addEventListener(&quot;change&quot;, function (evt) {\n        var i = 0, len = this.files.length, img, reader, file;\n\n        for ( ; i &lt; len; i++ ) {\n            file = this.files[i];\n\n            if (!!file.type.match(/image.*/)) {\n                if ( window.FileReader ) {\n                    reader = new FileReader();\n                    reader.onloadend = function (e) {\n                        //showUploadedItem(e.target.result, file.fileName);\n                    };\n                    reader.readAsDataURL(file);\n                }\n\n                if (formdata) {\n                    formdata.append(&quot;image&quot;, file);\n                    formdata.append(&quot;extra&quot;,&apos;extra-data&apos;);\n                }\n\n                if (formdata) {\n                    jQuery(&apos;div#response&apos;).html(&apos;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;ajax-loader.gif&quot;/&gt;&apos;);\n\n                    jQuery.ajax({\n                        url: &quot;upload.php&quot;,\n                        type: &quot;POST&quot;,\n                        data: formdata,\n                        processData: false,\n                        contentType: false,\n                        success: function (res) {\n                         jQuery(&apos;div#response&apos;).html(&quot;Successfully uploaded&quot;);\n                        }\n                    });\n                }\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                alert(&apos;Not a vaild image!&apos;);\n            }\n        }\n\n    }, false);\n});\n\n\nExplanation\n\nI use response div to show the uploading animation and response after upload is done.\n\nBest part is you can send extra data such as ids &amp; etc with the file when you use this script.

For example you can start a UI blocker and then onLoad ( or when cookie is made )  you remove the UI blocker.\n\n\nUsing a cookie for this is ugly but it works.  \n\nI made a jQuery plugin to handle this issue for Chrome when downloading, you can find here\n\nhttps://github.com/ArtisticPhoenix/jQuery-Plugins/blob/master/iDownloader.js\n\nThe same basic principal applies to uploading, as well.\n\nTo use the downloader  ( include the JS, obviously )\n\n $(&apos;body&apos;).iDownloader({\n     &quot;onComplete&quot; : function(){\n          $(&apos;#uiBlocker&apos;).css(&apos;display&apos;, &apos;none&apos;); //hide ui blocker on complete\n     }\n });\n\n $(&apos;somebuttion&apos;).click( function(){\n      $(&apos;#uiBlocker&apos;).css(&apos;display&apos;, &apos;block&apos;); //block the UI\n      $(&apos;body&apos;).iDownloader(&apos;download&apos;, &apos;htttp://example.com/location/of/download&apos;);\n });\n\n\nAnd on the server side, just before transferring the file data, create the cookie\n\n setcookie(&apos;iDownloader&apos;, true, time() + 30, &quot;/&quot;);\n\n\nThe plugin will see the cookie, and then trigger the onComplete callback.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution10","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I&apos;ve written this up in a Rails environment.

<p>With <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5" rel="noreferrer">HTML5</a> you can make file uploads with Ajax and jQuery. Not only that, you can do file validations (name, size, and MIME type) or handle the progress event with the HTML5 progress tag (or a div). Recently I had to make a file uploader, but I didn't want to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash" rel="noreferrer">Flash</a> nor Iframes or plugins and after some research I came up with the solution.</p>

<p>The HTML:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;form enctype=<span class="hljs-string">"multipart/form-data"</span>&gt;
    <span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">input</span> <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"file"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"file"</span> /&gt;</span></span>
    <span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">input</span> <span class="hljs-attr">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"button"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">value</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"Upload"</span> /&gt;</span></span>
&lt;/form&gt;
<span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">progress</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">progress</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>

<p>First, you can do some validation if you want. For example, in the <code>.on('change')</code> event of the file:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$(<span class="hljs-string">':file'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">on</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'change'</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> file = <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">files</span>[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>];

  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (file.<span class="hljs-property">size</span> &gt; <span class="hljs-number">1024</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-title function_">alert</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'max upload size is 1k'</span>);
  }

  <span class="hljs-comment">// Also see .name, .type</span>
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now the <code>$.ajax()</code> submit with the button's click:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$(<span class="hljs-string">':button'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">on</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
  $.<span class="hljs-title function_">ajax</span>({
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Your server script to process the upload</span>
    <span class="hljs-attr">url</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'upload.php'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attr">type</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'POST'</span>,

    <span class="hljs-comment">// Form data</span>
    <span class="hljs-attr">data</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">FormData</span>($(<span class="hljs-string">'form'</span>)[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]),

    <span class="hljs-comment">// Tell jQuery not to process data or worry about content-type</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// You *must* include these options!</span>
    <span class="hljs-attr">cache</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attr">contentType</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attr">processData</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>,

    <span class="hljs-comment">// Custom XMLHttpRequest</span>
    <span class="hljs-attr">xhr</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
      <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myXhr = $.ajaxSettings.<span class="hljs-title function_">xhr</span>();
      <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (myXhr.<span class="hljs-property">upload</span>) {
        <span class="hljs-comment">// For handling the progress of the upload</span>
        myXhr.<span class="hljs-property">upload</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">addEventListener</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'progress'</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">e</span>) {
          <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (e.<span class="hljs-property">lengthComputable</span>) {
            $(<span class="hljs-string">'progress'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">attr</span>({
              <span class="hljs-attr">value</span>: e.<span class="hljs-property">loaded</span>,
              <span class="hljs-attr">max</span>: e.<span class="hljs-property">total</span>,
            });
          }
        }, <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>);
      }
      <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> myXhr;
    }
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, with HTML5 (and some research) file uploading not only becomes possible but super easy. Try it with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome" rel="noreferrer">Google Chrome</a> as some of the HTML5 components of the examples aren't available in every browser.</p>

<p>An important thing to understand with the "new" HTML5 <code>file</code> API is that it <a href="http://caniuse.com/fileapi" rel="nofollow noreferrer">wasn't supported until IE&nbsp;10</a>. If the specific market you're aiming at has a higher-than-average propensity toward older versions of Windows, you might not have access to it.</p>
<p>As of 2017, about 5% of browsers are one of IE 6, 7, 8 or 9. If you head into a big corporation (e.g., this is a B2B tool or something you're delivering for training) that number can skyrocket. In 2016, I dealt with a company using IE8 on over 60% of their machines.</p>
<p>It's 2019 as of this edit, almost 11 years after my initial answer. IE9 and lower are <em>globally</em> around the 1% mark but there are still clusters of higher usage.</p>
<p>The important take-away from this whatever the feature is, <strong>check what browser <em>your</em> users use</strong>. If you don't, you'll learn a quick and painful lesson in why "works for me" isn't good enough in a deliverable to a client. <a href="https://caniuse.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">caniuse</a> is a useful tool but note where they get their demographics from. They may not align with yours. This is never truer than enterprise environments.</p>
<p>My answer from 2008 follows.</p>
<hr>
<p>However, there are viable non-JS methods of file uploads. You can create an iframe on the page (that you hide with CSS) and then target your form to post to that iframe. The main page doesn't need to move.</p>
<p>It's a "real" post so it's not wholly interactive. If you need status you need something server-side to process that. This varies massively depending on your server. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ASP.NET</a> has nicer mechanisms. PHP plain fails, but you can use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Perl</a> or Apache modifications to get around it.</p>
<p>If you need multiple file uploads, it's best to do each file one at a time (to overcome maximum file upload limits). Post the first form to the iframe, monitor its progress using the above and when it has finished, post the second form to the iframe, and so on.</p>
<p>Or use a Java/Flash solution. They're a lot more flexible in what they can do with their posts...</p>

<p>Wrapping up for future readers.</p>

<h1>Asynchronous File Upload</h1>

<h2>With HTML5</h2>

<p>You can upload files <strong>with jQuery</strong> using the <code>$.ajax()</code> method if <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Using_FormData_Objects" rel="noreferrer">FormData</a> and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_files_from_web_applications" rel="noreferrer">File API</a> are supported (both HTML5 features). </p>

<p>You can also send files <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Using_XMLHttpRequest#Submitting_forms_and_uploading_files" rel="noreferrer">without FormData</a> but either way the File API must be present to process files in such a way that they can be sent with <em>XMLHttpRequest</em> (Ajax).</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$.<span class="hljs-title function_">ajax</span>({
  <span class="hljs-attr">url</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'file/destination.html'</span>, 
  <span class="hljs-attr">type</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'POST'</span>,
  <span class="hljs-attr">data</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">FormData</span>($(<span class="hljs-string">'#formWithFiles'</span>)[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]), <span class="hljs-comment">// The form with the file inputs.</span>
  <span class="hljs-attr">processData</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>,
  <span class="hljs-attr">contentType</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>                    <span class="hljs-comment">// Using FormData, no need to process data.</span>
}).<span class="hljs-title function_">done</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Success: Files sent!"</span>);
}).<span class="hljs-title function_">fail</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"An error occurred, the files couldn't be sent!"</span>);
});
</code></pre>

<p>For a quick, pure JavaScript (<strong>no jQuery</strong>) example see "<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Using_FormData_Objects#Sending_files_using_a_FormData_object" rel="noreferrer">Sending files using a FormData object</a>".</p>

<h2>Fallback</h2>

<p>When HTML5 isn't supported (no <em>File API</em>) the only other pure JavaScript solution (no <em>Flash</em> or any other browser plugin) is the <strong>hidden iframe</strong> technique, which allows to emulate an asynchronous request without using the <em>XMLHttpRequest</em> object.</p>

<p>It consists of setting an iframe as the target of the form with the file inputs. When the user submits a request is made and the files are uploaded but the response is displayed inside the iframe instead of re-rendering the main page. Hiding the iframe makes the whole process transparent to the user and emulates an asynchronous request.</p>

<p>If done properly it should work virtually on any browser, but it has some caveats as how to obtain the response from the iframe. </p>

<p>In this case you may prefer to use a wrapper plugin like <a href="//github.com/matiasgagliano/bifrost" rel="noreferrer">Bifröst</a> which uses the <em>iframe technique</em> but also provides a <a href="//api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxTransport" rel="noreferrer">jQuery Ajax transport</a> allowing to <strong>send files</strong> with just the <code>$.ajax()</code> method like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$.<span class="hljs-title function_">ajax</span>({
  <span class="hljs-attr">url</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'file/destination.html'</span>, 
  <span class="hljs-attr">type</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'POST'</span>,
  <span class="hljs-comment">// Set the transport to use (iframe means to use Bifröst)</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">// and the expected data type (json in this case).</span>
  <span class="hljs-attr">dataType</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'iframe json'</span>,                                
  <span class="hljs-attr">fileInputs</span>: $(<span class="hljs-string">'input[type="file"]'</span>),  <span class="hljs-comment">// The file inputs containing the files to send.</span>
  <span class="hljs-attr">data</span>: { <span class="hljs-attr">msg</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'Some extra data you might need.'</span>}
}).<span class="hljs-title function_">done</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Success: Files sent!"</span>);
}).<span class="hljs-title function_">fail</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"An error occurred, the files couldn't be sent!"</span>);
});
</code></pre>

<h2>Plugins</h2>

<p><a href="//github.com/matiasgagliano/bifrost" rel="noreferrer">Bifröst</a> is just a small wrapper that adds fallback support to jQuery's ajax method, but many of the aforementioned plugins like <a href="//malsup.com/jquery/form/" rel="noreferrer">jQuery Form Plugin</a> or <a href="//github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload" rel="noreferrer">jQuery File Upload</a> include the whole stack from HTML5 to different fallbacks and some useful features to ease out the process. Depending on your needs and requirements you might want to consider a bare implementation or either of this plugins.</p>

<h1>Explanation</h1>

<p>I use response <code>div</code> to show the uploading animation and response after upload is done.</p>

<p>Best part is you can send extra data such as ids &amp; etc with the file when you use this script. I have mention it <code>extra-data</code> as in the script.</p>

<p>At the PHP level this will work as normal file upload. extra-data can be retrieved as <code>$_POST</code> data.</p>

<p>Here you are not using a plugin and stuff. You can change the code as you want. You are not blindly coding here. This is the core functionality of any jQuery file upload. Actually Javascript.</p>

<p>The simplest and most robust way I have done this in the past, is to simply target a hidden iFrame tag with your form - then it will submit within the iframe without reloading the page.</p>

<p>That is if you don't want to use a plugin, JavaScript or any other forms of "magic" other than HTML.  Of course you can combine this with JavaScript or what have you...</p>

<p>You can also read the contents of the iframe <code>onLoad</code> for server errors or success responses and then output that to user.</p>

<p><strong>Chrome, iFrames, and onLoad</strong> </p>

<p><em>-note- you only need to keep reading if you are interested in how to setup a UI blocker when doing uploading/downloading</em></p>

<p>Currently Chrome doesn't trigger the onLoad event for the iframe when it's used to transfer files.  Firefox, IE, and Edge all fire the onload event for file transfers.</p>

<p>The only solution that I found works for Chrome was to use a cookie.  </p>

<p>To do that basically when the upload/download is started:</p>

<ul>
<li>[Client Side] Start an interval to look for the existence of a cookie</li>
<li>[Server Side] Do whatever you need to with the file data</li>
<li>[Server Side] Set cookie for client side interval</li>
<li>[Client Side] Interval sees the cookie and uses it like the onLoad event.  For example you can start a UI blocker and then onLoad ( or when cookie is made )  you remove the UI blocker.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using a cookie for this is ugly but it works.  </p>

<p>I made a jQuery plugin to handle this issue for Chrome when downloading, you can find here</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/ArtisticPhoenix/jQuery-Plugins/blob/master/iDownloader.js" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/ArtisticPhoenix/jQuery-Plugins/blob/master/iDownloader.js</a></p>

<p>The same basic principal applies to uploading, as well.</p>

<p>To use the downloader  ( include the JS, obviously )</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"> $(<span class="hljs-string">'body'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">iDownloader</span>({
     <span class="hljs-string">"onComplete"</span> : <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
          $(<span class="hljs-string">'#uiBlocker'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">css</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'display'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'none'</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">//hide ui blocker on complete</span>
     }
 });

 $(<span class="hljs-string">'somebuttion'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">click</span>( <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
      $(<span class="hljs-string">'#uiBlocker'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">css</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'display'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'block'</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">//block the UI</span>
      $(<span class="hljs-string">'body'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">iDownloader</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'download'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'htttp://example.com/location/of/download'</span>);
 });
</code></pre>

<p>And on the server side, just before transferring the file data, create the cookie</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"> <span class="hljs-title function_">setcookie</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'iDownloader'</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>, <span class="hljs-title function_">time</span>() + <span class="hljs-number">30</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"/"</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>The plugin will see the cookie, and then trigger the <code>onComplete</code> callback.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.williambharding.com/blog/rails/rails-ajax-image-uploading-made-simple-with-jquery/" rel="noreferrer">I've written this up in a Rails environment</a>.  It's only about five lines of JavaScript, if you use the lightweight jQuery-form plugin.</p>

<p>The challenge is in getting AJAX upload working as the standard <code>remote_form_for</code> doesn't understand multi-part form submission. It's not going to send the file data Rails seeks back with the AJAX request.   </p>

<p>That's where the jQuery-form plugin comes into play.  </p>

<p>Heres the Rails code for it:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;% <span class="hljs-title function_">remote_form_for</span>(:image_form, 
                   :<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">url</span> =&gt;</span> { :<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">controller</span> =&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-string">"blogs"</span>, :<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">action</span> =&gt;</span> :create_asset }, 
                   :<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">html</span> =&gt;</span> { :<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">method</span> =&gt;</span> :post, 
                              :<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">id</span> =&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-string">'uploadForm'</span>, :<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">multipart</span> =&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-literal">true</span> }) 
                                                                        <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> |f| %&gt;
 <span class="hljs-title class_">Upload</span> a <span class="hljs-attr">file</span>: &lt;%= f.<span class="hljs-property">file_field</span> :uploaded_data %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Heres the associated JavaScript:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$(<span class="hljs-string">'#uploadForm input'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">change</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
 $(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">parent</span>().<span class="hljs-title function_">ajaxSubmit</span>({
  <span class="hljs-attr">beforeSubmit</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">a,f,o</span>) {
   o.<span class="hljs-property">dataType</span> = <span class="hljs-string">'json'</span>;
  },
  <span class="hljs-attr">complete</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">XMLHttpRequest, textStatus</span>) {
   <span class="hljs-comment">// XMLHttpRequest.responseText will contain the URL of the uploaded image.</span>
   <span class="hljs-comment">// Put it in an image element you create, or do with it what you will.</span>
   <span class="hljs-comment">// For example, if you have an image elemtn with id "my_image", then</span>
   <span class="hljs-comment">//  $('#my_image').attr('src', XMLHttpRequest.responseText);</span>
   <span class="hljs-comment">// Will set that image tag to display the uploaded image.</span>
  },
 });
});
</code></pre>

<p>And heres the Rails controller action, pretty vanilla:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"> @image = <span class="hljs-title class_">Image</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">new</span>(params[:image_form])
 @image.<span class="hljs-property">save</span>
 render :<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">text</span> =&gt;</span> @image.<span class="hljs-property">public_filename</span>

<p>To upload file asynchronously with Jquery use below steps:</p>
<p><strong>step 1</strong> In your project open Nuget manager and add package (jquery fileupload(only you need to write it in search box it will come up and install it.))
URL: <a href="https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload</a></p>
<p><strong>step 2</strong> Add below scripts in the HTML files, which are already added to the project by running above package:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>jquery.ui.widget.js</p>
<p>jquery.iframe-transport.js</p>
<p>jquery.fileupload.js</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>step 3</strong>  Write file upload control as per below code:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;input id=<span class="hljs-string">"upload"</span> name=<span class="hljs-string">"upload"</span> type=<span class="hljs-string">"file"</span> /&gt;

<p>Also some further information about XMLHttpReques:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The XMLHttpRequest Object</strong></p>
<p>All modern browsers support the XMLHttpRequest object.
The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to exchange data with a web
server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update
parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Create an XMLHttpRequest Object</strong></p>
<p>All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox,
IE7+, Edge, Safari, Opera) have a built-in XMLHttpRequest object.</p>
<p>Syntax for creating an XMLHttpRequest object:</p>
<p>variable = new XMLHttpRequest();</p>

<p>You can do the Asynchronous Multiple File uploads using JavaScript or jQuery and that to without using any plugin. You can also show the real time progress of file upload in the progress control. I have come across 2 nice links -</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.yogihosting.com/multi-file-upload-with-progress-bar-in-asp-net/" rel="noreferrer">ASP.NET Web Forms based Mulitple File Upload Feature with Progress Bar</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.yogihosting.com/jquery-file-upload/" rel="noreferrer">ASP.NET MVC based Multiple File Upload made in jQuery</a></li>
</ol>

<p>The server side language is C# but you can do some modification for making it work with other language like PHP.</p>

<p><strong>File Upload ASP.NET Core MVC:</strong></p>

<p>In the View create file upload control in html:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;form method=<span class="hljs-string">"post"</span> asp-action=<span class="hljs-string">"Add"</span> enctype=<span class="hljs-string">"multipart/form-data"</span>&gt;
    <span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">input</span> <span class="hljs-attr">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"file"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">multiple</span> <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"mediaUpload"</span> /&gt;</span></span>

&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now create action method in your controller:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">[<span class="hljs-title class_">HttpPost</span>]

        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>hostingEnvironment variable is of type IHostingEnvironment which can be injected to the controller using dependency injection, like:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">private <span class="hljs-title class_">IHostingEnvironment</span> hostingEnvironment;

If you don\u0026apos;t, you\u0026apos;ll learn a quick and painful lesson in why \u0026quot;works for me\u0026quot; isn\u0026apos;t good enough in a deliverable to a client. \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://caniuse.com/\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;nofollow noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;caniuse\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; is a useful tool but note where they get their demographics from. They may not align with yours. This is never truer than enterprise environments.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;My answer from 2008 follows.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;However, there are viable non-JS methods of file uploads. You can create an iframe on the page (that you hide with CSS) and then target your form to post to that iframe. The main page doesn\u0026apos;t need to move.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;It\u0026apos;s a \u0026quot;real\u0026quot; post so it\u0026apos;s not wholly interactive. If you need status you need something server-side to process that. This varies massively depending on your server. \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;nofollow noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;ASP.NET\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; has nicer mechanisms. PHP plain fails, but you can use \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;nofollow noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Perl\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; or Apache modifications to get around it.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If you need multiple file uploads, it\u0026apos;s best to do each file one at a time (to overcome maximum file upload limits). Post the first form to the iframe, monitor its progress using the above and when it has finished, post the second form to the iframe, and so on.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Or use a Java/Flash solution.
