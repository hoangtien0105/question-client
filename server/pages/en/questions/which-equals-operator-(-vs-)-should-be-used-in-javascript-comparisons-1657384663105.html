I&#x27;m using JSLint to go through JavaScript, and it&#x27;s returning many suggestions to replace == (two equals signs) with === (three equals signs) when doing things like comparing idSele_UNVEHtype.value.length == 0 inside of an if statement.

Is there a performance benefit to replacing == with ===? 

Any performance improvement would be welcomed as many comparison operators exist.

If no type conversion takes place, would there be a performance gain over ==?

The === operator will not do the conversion, so if two values are not the same type === will simply return false. Both are equally quick.\n\nTo quote Douglas Crockford&apos;s excellent JavaScript: The Good Parts,\n\n\n  JavaScript has two sets of equality operators: === and !==, and their evil twins == and !=.  The good ones work the way you would expect.  If the two operands are of the same type and have the same value, then === produces true and !== produces false.  The evil twins do the right thing when the operands are of the same type, but if they are of different types, they attempt to coerce the values.  the rules by which they do that are complicated and unmemorable.  These are some of the interesting cases:\n\n&apos;&apos; == &apos;0&apos;           // false\n0 == &apos;&apos;             // true\n0 == &apos;0&apos;            // true\n\nfalse == &apos;false&apos;    // false\nfalse == &apos;0&apos;        // true\n\nfalse == undefined  // false\nfalse == null       // false\nnull == undefined   // true\n\n&apos; \\t\\r\\n &apos; == 0     // true\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  The lack of transitivity is alarming.  My advice is to never use the evil twins.  Instead, always use === and !==.  All of the comparisons just shown produce false with the === operator.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nA good point was brought up by @Casebash in the comments and in @Phillipe Laybaert&apos;s answer concerning objects.  For objects, == and === act consistently with one another (except in a special case).\n\nvar a = [1,2,3];\nvar b = [1,2,3];\n\nvar c = { x: 1, y: 2 };\nvar d = { x: 1, y: 2 };\n\nvar e = &quot;text&quot;;\nvar f = &quot;te&quot; + &quot;xt&quot;;\n\na == b            // false\na === b           // false\n\nc == d            // false\nc === d           // false\n\ne == f            // true\ne === f           // true\n\n\nThe special case is when you compare a primitive with an object that evaluates to the same primitive, due to its toString or valueOf method. For example, consider the comparison of a string primitive with a string object created using the String constructor.\n\n&quot;abc&quot; == new String(&quot;abc&quot;)    // true\n&quot;abc&quot; === new String(&quot;abc&quot;)   // false\n\n\nHere the == operator is checking the values of the two objects and returning true, but the === is seeing that they&apos;re not the same type and returning false.  Which one is correct?  That really depends on what you&apos;re trying to compare.  My advice is to bypass the question entirely and just don&apos;t use the String constructor to create string objects from string literals.\n\nReference\nhttp://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.9.3\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Using the == operator (Equality)\ntrue == 1; //true, because &apos;true&apos; is converted to 1 and then compared\n&quot;2&quot; == 2;  //true, because &quot;2&quot; is converted to 2 and then compared\n\nUsing the === operator (Identity)\ntrue === 1; //false\n&quot;2&quot; === 2;  //false\n\nThis is because the equality operator == does type coercion, meaning that the interpreter implicitly tries to convert the values before comparing.\nOn the other hand, the identity operator === does not do type coercion, and thus does not convert the values when comparing.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Here&apos;s an interesting visualisation of the equality comparison between == and ===.\nSource: https://github.com/dorey/JavaScript-Equality-Table (demo, unified demo)\n\nvar1 === var2\nWhen using === for JavaScript equality testing, everything is as is.\nNothing gets converted before being evaluated.\n\nvar1 == var2\nWhen using == for JavaScript equality testing, some funky conversions take place.\n\nSummary of equality in Javascript\n\n\nConclusion:\nAlways use ===, unless you fully understand the funky conversions that take place with ==.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"In the answers here, I didn&apos;t read anything about what equal means. Some will say that === means equal and of the same type, but that&apos;s not really true. It actually means that both operands reference the same object, or in case of value types, have the same value.\nSo, let&apos;s take the following code:\nvar a = [1,2,3];\nvar b = [1,2,3];\nvar c = a;\n\nvar ab_eq = (a === b); // false (even though a and b are the same type)\nvar ac_eq = (a === c); // true\n\nThe same here:\nvar a = { x: 1, y: 2 };\nvar b = { x: 1, y: 2 };\nvar c = a;\n\nvar ab_eq = (a === b); // false (even though a and b are the same type)\nvar ac_eq = (a === c); // true\n\nOr even:\nvar a = { };\nvar b = { };\nvar c = a;\n\nvar ab_eq = (a === b); // false (even though a and b are the same type)\nvar ac_eq = (a === c); // true\n\nThis behavior is not always obvious. There&apos;s more to the story than being equal and being of the same type.\nThe rule is:\nFor value types (numbers):\na === b returns true if a and b have the same value and are of the same type\nFor reference types:\na === b returns true if a and b reference the exact same object\nFor strings:\na === b returns true if a and b are both strings and contain the exact same characters\n\nStrings: the special case...\nStrings are not value types, but in Javascript they behave like value types, so they will be &quot;equal&quot; when the characters in the string are the same and when they are of the same length (as explained in the third rule)\nNow it becomes interesting:\nvar a = &quot;12&quot; + &quot;3&quot;;\nvar b = &quot;123&quot;;\n\nalert(a === b); // returns true, because strings behave like value types\n\nBut how about this?:\nvar a = new String(&quot;123&quot;);\nvar b = &quot;123&quot;;\n\nalert(a === b); // returns false !! (but they are equal and of the same type)\n\nI thought strings behave like value types? Well, it depends who you ask... In this case a and b are not the same type. a is of type Object, while b is of type string. Just remember that creating a string object using the String constructor creates something of type Object that behaves as a string most of the time.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Let me add this counsel:\nIf in doubt, read the specification!\nECMA-262 is the specification for a scripting language of which JavaScript is a dialect. Of course in practice it matters more how the most important browsers behave than an esoteric definition of how something is supposed to be handled. But it is helpful to understand why new String(&quot;a&quot;) !== &quot;a&quot;.\nPlease let me explain how to read the specification to clarify this question. I see that in this very old topic nobody had an answer for the very strange effect. So, if you can read a specification, this will help you in your profession tremendously. It is an acquired skill. So, let&apos;s continue.\nSearching the PDF file for === brings me to page 56 of the specification: 11.9.4. The Strict Equals Operator ( === ), and after wading through the specificationalese I find:\n\n11.9.6 The Strict Equality Comparison Algorithm\nThe comparison x === y, where x and y are values, produces true or false. Such a comparison is performed as follows:\n  1. If Type(x) is different from Type(y), return false.\n  2. If Type(x) is Undefined, return true.\n  3. If Type(x) is Null, return true.\n  4. If Type(x) is not Number, go to step 11.\n  5. If x is NaN, return false.\n  6. If y is NaN, return false.\n  7. If x is the same number value as y, return true.\n  8. If x is +0 and y is 0, return true.\n  9. If x is 0 and y is +0, return true.\n  10. Return false.\n  11. If Type(x) is String, then return true if x and y are exactly the same sequence of characters (same length and same characters in corresponding positions); otherwise, return false.\n  12. If Type(x) is Boolean, return true if x and y are both true or both false; otherwise, return false.\n  13. Return true if x and y refer to the same object or if they refer to objects joined to each other (see 13.1.2). Otherwise, return false.\n\nInteresting is step 11. Yes, strings are treated as value types. But this does not explain why new String(&quot;a&quot;) !== &quot;a&quot;. Do we have a browser not conforming to ECMA-262?\nNot so fast!\nLet&apos;s check the types of the operands. Try it out for yourself by wrapping them in typeof(). I find that new String(&quot;a&quot;) is an object, and step 1 is used: return false if the types are different.\nIf you wonder why new String(&quot;a&quot;) does not return a string, how about some exercise reading a specification? Have fun!\n\nAidiakapi wrote this in a comment below:\n\nFrom the specification\n11.2.2 The new Operator:\nIf Type(constructor) is not Object, throw a TypeError exception.\nWith other words, if String wouldn&apos;t be of type Object it couldn&apos;t be used with the new operator.\n\nnew always returns an Object, even for String constructors, too. And alas! The value semantics for strings (see step 11) is lost.\nAnd this finally means: new String(&quot;a&quot;) !== &quot;a&quot;.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I tested this in Firefox with Firebug using code like this:\n\n\nconsole.time(&quot;testEquality&quot;);\nvar n = 0;\nwhile (true) {\n  n++;\n  if (n == 100000)\n    break;\n}\nconsole.timeEnd(&quot;testEquality&quot;);\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\nand\n\n\nconsole.time(&quot;testTypeEquality&quot;);\nvar n = 0;\nwhile (true) {\n  n++;\n  if (n === 100000)\n    break;\n}\nconsole.timeEnd(&quot;testTypeEquality&quot;);\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\nMy results (tested five times each and averaged):\n==: 115.2\n===: 114.4\n\nSo I&apos;d say that the miniscule difference (this is over 100000 iterations, remember) is negligible.

<p>I'm using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSLint" rel="noreferrer">JSLint</a> to go through JavaScript, and it's returning many suggestions to replace <code>==</code> (two equals signs) with <code>===</code> (three equals signs) when doing things like comparing <code>idSele_UNVEHtype.value.length == 0</code> inside of an <code>if</code> statement.</p>

<p>Is there a performance benefit to replacing <code>==</code> with <code>===</code>? </p>

<p>Any performance improvement would be welcomed as many comparison operators exist.</p>

<p>If no type conversion takes place, would there be a performance gain over <code>==</code>?</p>

<p>The strict equality operator (<code>===</code>) behaves identically to the abstract equality operator (<code>==</code>) except no type conversion is done, and the types must be the same to be considered equal.</p>

<p>Reference: <a href="http://www.c-point.com/javascript_tutorial/jsgrpComparison.htm" rel="noreferrer">Javascript Tutorial: Comparison Operators</a></p>

<p>The <code>==</code> operator will compare for equality <em>after doing any necessary type conversions</em>.  The <code>===</code> operator will <strong>not</strong> do the conversion, so if two values are not the same type <code>===</code> will simply return <code>false</code>. Both are equally quick.</p>

<p>To quote Douglas Crockford's excellent <a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0596517742" rel="noreferrer">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JavaScript has two sets of equality operators: <code>===</code> and <code>!==</code>, and their evil twins <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>.  The good ones work the way you would expect.  If the two operands are of the same type and have the same value, then <code>===</code> produces <code>true</code> and <code>!==</code> produces <code>false</code>.  The evil twins do the right thing when the operands are of the same type, but if they are of different types, they attempt to coerce the values.  the rules by which they do that are complicated and unmemorable.  These are some of the interesting cases:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-string">''</span> == <span class="hljs-string">'0'</span>           <span class="hljs-comment">// false</span>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lack of transitivity is alarming.  My advice is to never use the evil twins.  Instead, always use <code>===</code> and <code>!==</code>.  All of the comparisons just shown produce <code>false</code> with the <code>===</code> operator.</p>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>A good point was brought up by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/165495/casebash">@Casebash</a> in the comments and in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/113570/philippe-leybaert">@Phillipe Laybaert's</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/957602/1288">answer</a> concerning objects.  For objects, <code>==</code> and <code>===</code> act consistently with one another (except in a special case).</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>];
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> b = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>];

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> c = { <span class="hljs-attr">x</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">y</span>: <span class="hljs-number">2</span> };

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> e = <span class="hljs-string">"text"</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> f = <span class="hljs-string">"te"</span> + <span class="hljs-string">"xt"</span>;

a == b            <span class="hljs-comment">// false</span>
a === b           <span class="hljs-comment">// false</span>

c === d           <span class="hljs-comment">// false</span>

e == f            <span class="hljs-comment">// true</span>
e === f           <span class="hljs-comment">// true</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The special case is when you compare a primitive with an object that evaluates to the same primitive, due to its <code>toString</code> or <code>valueOf</code> method. For example, consider the comparison of a string primitive with a string object created using the <code>String</code> constructor.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-string">"abc"</span> == <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"abc"</span>)    <span class="hljs-comment">// true</span>
<span class="hljs-string">"abc"</span> === <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"abc"</span>)   <span class="hljs-comment">// false</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Here the <code>==</code> operator is checking the values of the two objects and returning <code>true</code>, but the <code>===</code> is seeing that they're not the same type and returning <code>false</code>.  Which one is correct?  That really depends on what you're trying to compare.  My advice is to bypass the question entirely and just don't use the <code>String</code> constructor to create string objects from string literals.</p>

<p>This is because the <strong>equality operator <code>==</code> does type coercion</strong>, meaning that the interpreter implicitly tries to convert the values before comparing.</p>

<p>In the answers here, I didn't read anything about what <strong>equal</strong> means. Some will say that <code>===</code> means <strong>equal and of the same type</strong>, but that's not really true. It actually means that <strong>both operands reference the same object</strong>, or in case of <strong>value types, have the same value</strong>.</p>
<p>So, let's take the following code:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>];
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> b = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>];
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> c = a;

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> ab_eq = (a === b); <span class="hljs-comment">// false (even though a and b are the same type)</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> ac_eq = (a === c); <span class="hljs-comment">// true</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The same here:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = { <span class="hljs-attr">x</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">y</span>: <span class="hljs-number">2</span> };
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> b = { <span class="hljs-attr">x</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-attr">y</span>: <span class="hljs-number">2</span> };
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> c = a;

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> ab_eq = (a === b); <span class="hljs-comment">// false (even though a and b are the same type)</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> ac_eq = (a === c); <span class="hljs-comment">// true</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Or even:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = { };
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> b = { };
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> c = a;

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> ab_eq = (a === b); <span class="hljs-comment">// false (even though a and b are the same type)</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> ac_eq = (a === c); <span class="hljs-comment">// true</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This behavior is not always obvious. There's more to the story than being equal and being of the same type.</p>
<p>The rule is:</p>
<p><em><strong>For value types (numbers):</strong></em><br>
<code>a === b</code> returns true if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> have the same value and are of the same type</p>
<p><em><strong>For reference types:</strong></em><br>
<code>a === b</code> returns true if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> reference the exact same object</p>
<p><em><strong>For strings:</strong></em><br>
<code>a === b</code> returns true if <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are both strings and contain the exact same characters</p>
<hr>
<h2>Strings: the special case...</h2>
<p>Strings are not value types, but in Javascript they behave like value types, so they will be "equal" when the characters in the string are the same and when they are of the same length (as explained in the third rule)</p>
<p>Now it becomes interesting:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = <span class="hljs-string">"12"</span> + <span class="hljs-string">"3"</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> b = <span class="hljs-string">"123"</span>;

<span class="hljs-title function_">alert</span>(a === b); <span class="hljs-comment">// returns true, because strings behave like value types</span>
</code></pre>
<p>But how about this?:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"123"</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> b = <span class="hljs-string">"123"</span>;

<span class="hljs-title function_">alert</span>(a === b); <span class="hljs-comment">// returns false !! (but they are equal and of the same type)</span>
</code></pre>
<p>I thought strings behave like value types? Well, it depends who you ask... In this case a and b are not the same type. <code>a</code> is of type <code>Object</code>, while <code>b</code> is of type <code>string</code>. Just remember that creating a string object using the <code>String</code> constructor creates something of type <code>Object</code> that behaves as a string <em>most of the time</em>.</p>

<p>Let me add this counsel:</p>
<p><em><strong>If in doubt, read the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm" rel="noreferrer">specification</a>!</strong></em></p>
<p>ECMA-262 is the specification for a scripting language of which JavaScript is a dialect. Of course in practice it matters more how the most important browsers behave than an esoteric definition of how something is supposed to be handled. But it is helpful to understand why <strong>new String("a") !== "a"</strong>.</p>
<p>Please let me explain how to read the specification to clarify this question. I see that in this very old topic nobody had an answer for the very strange effect. So, if you can read a specification, this will help you in your profession tremendously. It is an acquired skill. So, let's continue.</p>
<p>Searching the PDF file for === brings me to page 56 of the specification: <strong>11.9.4. The Strict Equals Operator ( === )</strong>, and after wading through the specificationalese I find:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>11.9.6 The Strict Equality Comparison Algorithm</strong><br>
The comparison x === y, where x and y are values, produces <strong>true</strong> or <strong>false</strong>. Such a comparison is performed as follows:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. If Type(x) is different from Type(y), return <strong>false</strong>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. If Type(x) is Undefined, return <strong>true</strong>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3. If Type(x) is Null, return <strong>true</strong>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4. If Type(x) is not Number, go to step 11.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;5. If x is <strong>NaN</strong>, return <strong>false</strong>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;6. If y is <strong>NaN</strong>, return <strong>false</strong>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;7. If x is the same number value as y, return <strong>true</strong>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;8. If x is +0 and y is 0, return <strong>true</strong>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;9. If x is 0 and y is +0, return <strong>true</strong>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Return <strong>false</strong>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;11. If Type(x) is String, then return <strong>true</strong> if x and y are exactly the same sequence of characters (same length and same characters in corresponding positions); otherwise, return <strong>false</strong>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;12. If Type(x) is Boolean, return <strong>true</strong> if x and y are both <strong>true</strong> or both <strong>false</strong>; otherwise, return <strong>false</strong>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;13. Return <strong>true</strong> if x and y refer to the same object or if they refer to objects joined to each other (see 13.1.2). Otherwise, return <strong>false</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting is step 11. Yes, strings are treated as value types. But this does not explain why <strong>new String("a") !== "a"</strong>. Do we have a browser not conforming to ECMA-262?</p>
<p>Not so fast!</p>
<p>Let's check the types of the operands. Try it out for yourself by wrapping them in <strong>typeof()</strong>. I find that <strong>new String("a")</strong> is an object, and step 1 is used: return <strong>false</strong> if the types are different.</p>
<p>If you wonder why <strong>new String("a")</strong> does not return a string, how about some exercise reading a specification? Have fun!</p>
<hr>
<p>Aidiakapi wrote this in a comment below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the specification</p>
<p><strong>11.2.2 The new Operator</strong>:</p>
<p>If Type(constructor) is not Object, throw a TypeError exception.</p>
<p>With other words, if String wouldn't be of type Object it couldn't be used with the new operator.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>new</strong> always returns an Object, even for <strong>String</strong> constructors, too. And alas! The value semantics for strings (see step 11) is lost.</p>

<p><strong>Why <code>==</code> is so unpredictable?</strong></p>

<p>What do you get when you compare an empty string <code>""</code> with the number zero <code>0</code>?</p>

<p><code>true</code></p>

<p>Yep, that's right according to <code>==</code> an empty string and the number zero are the same time.</p>

<p>And it doesn't end there, here's another one:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-string">'0'</span> == <span class="hljs-literal">false</span> <span class="hljs-comment">// true</span>

<p>And this is just the crazy stuff you get with primitives.</p>

<p>It's a whole new level of crazy when you use <code>==</code> with objects.</p>

<p>At this point your probably wondering...</p>

<p><strong>Why does this happen?</strong></p>

<p>Well it's because unlike "triple equals" (<code>===</code>) which just checks if two values are the same.</p>

<p><code>==</code> does a <strong><em>whole bunch of other stuff</em></strong>.</p>

<p>It has special handling for functions, special handling for nulls, undefined, strings, you name it.</p>

<p>It get's pretty wacky.</p>

<p>In fact, if you tried to write a function that does what <code>==</code> does it would look something like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">isEqual</span>(<span class="hljs-params">x, y</span>) { <span class="hljs-comment">// if `==` were a function</span>

    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> obj.<span class="hljs-title function_">toString</span>();
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>So what does this mean?</strong></p>

<p>It means <code>==</code> is complicated.</p>

<p>Because it's complicated it's hard to know what's going to happen when you use it.</p>

<p>Which means you could end up with bugs.</p>

<p><strong>So the moral of the story is...</strong></p>

<p>Make your life less complicated.</p>

<p>Use <code>===</code> instead of <code>==</code>.</p>

<p>The End.</p>

<p>The <strong>===</strong> operator is called a strict comparison operator, it <strong>does</strong> differ from the <strong>==</strong> operator.</p>

<p>Lets take 2 vars a and b.</p>

<p>For <strong>"a == b"</strong> to evaluate to true a and b need to be the <strong>same value</strong>.</p>

<p>In the case of <strong>"a === b"</strong> a and b must be the <strong>same value</strong> and also the <strong>same type</strong> for it to evaluate to true.  </p>

<p>Take the following example</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> b = <span class="hljs-string">"1"</span>;

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (a == b) <span class="hljs-comment">//evaluates to true as a and b are both 1</span>
{
    <span class="hljs-title function_">alert</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"a == b"</span>);
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (a === b) <span class="hljs-comment">//evaluates to false as a is not the same type as b</span>
{
    <span class="hljs-title function_">alert</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"a === b"</span>);
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>In summary</strong>; using the <strong>==</strong> operator might evaluate to true in situations where you do not want it to so using the <strong>===</strong> operator would be safer.  </p>

<p>In the 90% usage scenario it won't matter which one you use, but it is handy to know the difference when you get some unexpected behaviour one day.</p>

<p><em><strong>The equal comparison operator == is confusing and should be avoided.</strong></em> </p>

<p>If you <strong>HAVE TO</strong> live with it, then remember the following 3 things: </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>It is not transitive: <em>(a == b)</em> and <em>(b == c)</em> does not lead to <em>(a == c)</em></strong></li>
<li><strong>It's mutually exclusive to its negation: <em>(a == b)</em> and <em>(a != b)</em> always hold opposite Boolean values, with all a and b.</strong></li>
<li><strong>In case of doubt, learn by heart the following truth table:</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Each row in the table is a set of 3 mutually "equal" values, meaning that any 2 values among them are equal using the equal == sign*</li>

<p><strong>Yes!</strong> It does matter.</p>

<p><code>===</code> operator in javascript <strong>checks value as well as type</strong> where as <code>==</code> operator just checks <strong>the value (does type conversion if required)</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5ttlR.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>You can easily test it. Paste following code in an HTML file and open it in browser</p>

<p>Simply</p>
<p><code>==</code> means <strong>comparison</strong> between operands <strong>with</strong> type coercion</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><code>===</code> means <strong>comparison</strong> between operands <strong>without</strong> type coercion.</p>
<p>Type coercion in JavaScript means automatically converting data types to other data types.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-number">123</span> == <span class="hljs-string">"123"</span>  <span class="hljs-comment">// Returns true, because JS coerces string "123" to number 123</span>

<p>As a rule of thumb, I would generally use <code>===</code> instead of <code>==</code> (and <code>!==</code> instead of <code>!=</code>).</p>
<p>Reasons are explained in in the answers above and also Douglas Crockford is pretty clear about it (<a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0596517742" rel="noreferrer">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a>).</p>
<p>However there is <strong>one single exception</strong>:
<code>== null</code> is an efficient way to check for 'is null or undefined':</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>( value == <span class="hljs-literal">null</span> ){
    <span class="hljs-comment">// value is either null or undefined</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>For example jQuery 1.9.1 uses this pattern 43 times, and  the <a href="http://www.jshint.com/docs/#options" rel="noreferrer">JSHint syntax checker</a> even provides the <code>eqnull</code> relaxing option for this reason.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/" rel="noreferrer">jQuery style guide</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strict equality checks (===) should be used in favor of ==. The only
exception is when checking for undefined and null by way of null.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// Check for both undefined and null values, for some important reason. </span>
undefOrNull == <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>;

<p>EDIT 2021-03:</p>
<p>Nowadays <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_operators_logical_nullish_assignment" rel="noreferrer">most browsers</a>
support the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_operator" rel="noreferrer">Nullish coalescing operator (<code>??</code>)</a>
and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_nullish_assignment" rel="noreferrer">Logical nullish assignment <code>(??=)</code></a>, which allows a more concise way to
assign a default value if a variable is null or undefined, for example:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (a.<span class="hljs-property">speed</span> == <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>) {

  a.<span class="hljs-property">speed</span> = <span class="hljs-number">42</span>;

<p>It's a strict check test.</p>

<p>It's a good thing especially if you're checking between 0 and false and null. </p>

<p>For example, if you have:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$a = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>Then:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$a==<span class="hljs-number">0</span>;

<p>All returns true and you may not want this. Let's suppose you have a function that can return the 0th index of an array or false on failure. If you check with "==" false, you can get a confusing result.</p>

<p>So with the same thing as above, but a strict test:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$a = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;

$a===<span class="hljs-number">0</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// returns true</span>

<p>JSLint sometimes gives you unrealistic reasons to modify stuff. <code>===</code> has exactly the same performance as <code>==</code> if the types are already the same. </p>

<p>It is faster only when the types are not the same, in which case it does not try to convert types but directly returns a false.</p>

<p>So, <em>IMHO,</em> JSLint maybe used to write new code, but useless over-optimizing should be avoided at all costs. </p>

<p>Meaning, there is no reason to change <code>==</code> to <code>===</code> in a check like <code>if (a == 'test')</code> when you know it for a fact that a can only be a String. </p>

<p>Modifying a lot of code that way wastes developers' and reviewers' time and achieves nothing.</p>

<p>As the conclusion states:</p>

  <p>"Use three equals unless you fully understand the conversions that take

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> b = <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>Here <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> do not have values. Whereas, 0, false and '' are all values. One thing common beween all these are that they are all falsy values, which means they all <strong>satisfy</strong> falsy conditions.</p>

<p>So, the 0, false and '' together form a sub-group. And on other hand, null &amp; undefined form the second sub-group. Check the comparisons in the below image. null and undefined would equal. The other three would equal to each other. But, they all are treated as falsy conditions in JavaScript.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/11I0i.jpg" alt="Enter image description here"></p>

<p>This is same as any object (like {}, arrays, etc.), non-empty string &amp; Boolean true are all truthy conditions. But, they are all not equal.</p>
