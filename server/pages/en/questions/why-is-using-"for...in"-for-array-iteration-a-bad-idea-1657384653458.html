For-in iterates over the property names of an object, and in the case of an &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; array, the properties corresponds to the array indexes. (The built-in propertes like length, toString and so on are not included in the iteration.)\n\nHowever, if your code (or the framework you are using) add custom properties to arrays or to the array prototype, then these properties will be included in the iteration, which is probably not what you want.\n\nSome  JS frameworks, like Prototype modifies the Array prototype. Other frameworks like JQuery doesn&apos;t, so with JQuery you can safely use for-in.\n\nIf you are in doubt, you probably shouldn&apos;t use for-in. \n\nAn alternative way of iterating through an array is using a for-loop:\n\nfor (var ix=0;ix&lt;arr.length;ix++) alert(ix);\n\n\nHowever, this have a different issue.

Or in numerical order.  Or in lexical order (where &quot;30&quot; comes before &quot;4&quot;!  Keep in mind all object keys -- and thus, all array indexes -- are actually strings, so that makes total sense).  It could go through them by bucket, if it implemented objects as hash tables.  Or take any of that and add &quot;backwards&quot;.  A browser could even iterate randomly and be ECMA-262 compliant, as long as it visited each property exactly once.\n\nIn practice, most browsers currently like to iterate in roughly the same order.  But there&apos;s nothing saying they have to.  That&apos;s implementation specific, and could change at any time if another way was found to be far more efficient.\n\nEither way, for...in carries with it no connotation of order.

When you want to iterate over just the indexed properties of an array, the only guaranteed way to keep things semantically consistent is to use an integer index (that is, a for (var i = 0; i &lt; array.length; ++i) style loop).\n\nAny object can have arbitrary properties associated with it. There would be nothing terrible about loading additional properties onto an array instance, in particular. Code that wants to see only indexed array-like properties therefore must stick to an integer index.

You are expected to have full control over your software and know what you are doing. Let&apos;s see the mentioned drawbacks and disprove them one by one.\n\n\nIt loops through inherited properties as well: First of all any extensions to the Array.prototype should have been done by using Object.defineProperty() and their enumerable descriptor should be set to false. Any library not doing so should not be used at all.\nProperties those you add to the inheritance chain later get counted: When doing array sub-classing by Object.setPrototypeOf or by Class extend. You should again use Object.defineProperty() which by default sets the writable, enumerable and configurable property descriptors to false. Lets see an array sub-classing example here...\n\n\n\n\nfunction Stack(...a){\n  var stack = new Array(...a);\n  Object.setPrototypeOf(stack, Stack.prototype);\n  return stack;\n}\nStack.prototype = Object.create(Array.prototype);                                 // now stack has full access to array methods.\nObject.defineProperty(Stack.prototype,&quot;constructor&quot;,{value:Stack});               // now Stack is a proper constructor\nObject.defineProperty(Stack.prototype,&quot;peak&quot;,{value: function(){                  // add Stack &quot;only&quot; methods to the Stack.prototype.\n                                                       return this[this.length-1];\n                                                     }\n                                             });\nvar s = new Stack(1,2,3,4,1);\nconsole.log(s.peak());\ns[s.length] = 7;\nconsole.log(&quot;length:&quot;,s.length);\ns.push(42);\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(s));\nconsole.log(&quot;length:&quot;,s.length);\n\nfor(var i in s) console.log(s[i]);\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\nSo you see.. for in loop is now safe since you cared about your code.\n\n\nThe for in loop is slow: Hell no.

The standard for loop will execute a function as many times as you define in the parameters, and since an array is numbered, it makes more sense to define how many times you want to execute a function.

Understand the conditions upon which the different loops reiterate, their separate functionalities, and realize they will be more or less appropriate for differing scenarios. \n\nAlso, it may be considered a better practice to use the forEach method than the for...in loop in general, because it is easier to write and has more functionality, so you may want to get in the habit of only using this method and standard for, but your call.\n\nSee below that the first two loops only execute the console.log statements once, while the standard for loop executes the function as many times as specified, in this case, array.length = 6.\n\nvar arr = [];\narr[5] = &apos;F&apos;;\n\nfor (var index in arr) {\nconsole.log(index);\nconsole.log(arr[index]);\nconsole.log(arr)\n}\n// 5\n// &apos;F&apos;\n// =&gt; (6) [undefined x 5, 6]\n\narr.forEach(function(element, index, arr) {\nconsole.log(index);\nconsole.log(element);\nconsole.log(arr);\n});\n// 5\n// &apos;F&apos;\n// =&gt; Array (6) [undefined x 5, 6]\n\nfor (var index = 0; index &lt; arr.length; index++) {\nconsole.log(index);\nconsole.log(arr[index]);\nconsole.log(arr);\n};\n// 0\n// undefined\n// =&gt; Array (6) [undefined x 5, 6]\n\n// 1\n// undefined\n// =&gt; Array (6) [undefined x 5, 6]\n\n// 2\n// undefined\n// =&gt; Array (6) [undefined x 5, 6]\n\n// 3\n// undefined\n// =&gt; Array (6) [undefined x 5, 6]\n\n// 4\n// undefined\n// =&gt; Array (6) [undefined x 5, 6]\n\n// 5\n// &apos;F&apos;\n// =&gt; Array (6) [undefined x 5, 6]\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution23","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"A for...in loop always enumerates the keys.\nObjects properties keys are always String, even the indexed properties of an array :\n\nvar myArray = [&apos;a&apos;, &apos;b&apos;, &apos;c&apos;, &apos;d&apos;];\nvar total = 0\nfor (elem in myArray) {\n  total += elem\n}\nconsole.log(total); // 00123\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution24","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"for...in is useful when working on an object in JavaScript, but not for an Array, but still we can not say it&apos;s a wrong way, but it&apos;s not recommended, look at this example below using for...in loop:\n\nlet txt = &quot;&quot;;\nconst person = {fname:&quot;Alireza&quot;, lname:&quot;Dezfoolian&quot;, age:35}; \nfor (const x in person) {\n    txt += person[x] + &quot; &quot;;\n}\nconsole.log(txt); //Alireza Dezfoolian 35 \n\n\nOK, let&apos;s do it with Array now:\n\nlet txt = &quot;&quot;;\nconst person = [&quot;Alireza&quot;, &quot;Dezfoolian&quot;, 35]; \nfor (const x in person) {\n   txt += person[x] + &quot; &quot;;\n}\nconsole.log(txt); //Alireza Dezfoolian 35 \n\n\nAs you see the result the same...\n\nBut let&apos;s try something, let&apos;s prototype something to Array...\n\nArray.prototype.someoneelse = &quot;someoneelse&quot;;\n\n\nNow we create a new Array();\n\nlet txt = &quot;&quot;;\nconst arr = new Array();\narr[0] = &apos;Alireza&apos;;\narr[1] = &apos;Dezfoolian&apos;;\narr[2] = 35;\nfor(x in arr) {\n txt += arr[x] + &quot; &quot;;\n}\nconsole.log(txt); //Alireza Dezfoolian 35 someoneelse\n\n\nYou see the someoneelse!!!...

<p>The <code>for-in</code> statement by itself is not a "bad practice", however it can be <em>mis-used</em>, for example, to <em>iterate</em> over arrays or array-like objects.</p>

<p>The purpose of the <code>for-in</code> statement is to <em>enumerate</em> over object properties. This statement will go up in the prototype chain, also enumerating over <em>inherited</em> properties, a thing that <em>sometimes</em> is not desired.</p>

<p>Also, the order of iteration is not guaranteed by the spec., meaning that if you want to "iterate" an array object, with this statement you cannot be sure that the properties (array indexes) will be visited in the numeric order.</p>

<p>For example, in JScript (IE &lt;= 8), the order of enumeration even on Array objects is defined as the properties were created:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> array = [];
array[<span class="hljs-number">2</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>;
array[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>;
array[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>;

<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> p <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> array) {
  <span class="hljs-comment">//... p will be "2", "1" and "0" on IE</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, speaking about inherited properties, if you, for example, extend the <code>Array.prototype</code> object (like some libraries as MooTools do), that properties will be also enumerated:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title class_">Array</span>.<span class="hljs-property"><span class="hljs-keyword">prototype</span></span>.<span class="hljs-property">last</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) { <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>[<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">length</span>-<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]; };

<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> p <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> []) { <span class="hljs-comment">// an empty array</span>
  <span class="hljs-comment">// last will be enumerated</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>As I said before to <em>iterate</em> over arrays or array-like objects, the best thing is to use a <em>sequential loop</em>, such as a plain-old <code>for</code>/<code>while</code> loop.</p>

<p>When you want to enumerate only the <em>own properties</em> of an object (the ones that aren't inherited), you can use the <code>hasOwnProperty</code> method:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> prop <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> obj) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (obj.<span class="hljs-title function_">hasOwnProperty</span>(prop)) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// prop is not inherited</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And some people even recommend calling the method directly from <code>Object.prototype</code> to avoid having problems if somebody adds a property named <code>hasOwnProperty</code> to our object:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> prop <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> obj) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-title class_">Object</span>.<span class="hljs-property"><span class="hljs-keyword">prototype</span></span>.<span class="hljs-property">hasOwnProperty</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">call</span>(obj, prop)) {

<ul>
<li><p><code>for..in</code> will loop over all own and inherited properties of the array object which aren't <code>DontEnum</code>; that means if someone adds properties to the specific array object (there are valid reasons for this - I've done so myself) or changed <code>Array.prototype</code> (which is considered bad practice in code which is supposed to work well with other scripts), these properties will be iterated over as well; inherited properties can be excluded by checking <code>hasOwnProperty()</code>, but that won't help you with properties set in the array object itself</p></li>
<li><p><code>for..in</code> isn't guaranteed to preserve element ordering</p></li>
<li><p>it's slow because you have to walk all properties of the array object and its whole prototype chain and will still only get the property's name, ie to get the value, an additional lookup will be required</p></li>

<p>Short answer: It's just not worth it.</p>

<p>Longer answer: It's just not worth it, even if sequential element order and optimal performance aren't required.</p>

<hr>

<p>Long answer: It's just not worth it...</p>

<ul>
<li>Using <code>for (var property in array)</code> will cause <code>array</code> to be iterated over as an <em>object</em>, traversing the object prototype chain and ultimately performing slower than an index-based <code>for</code> loop.</li>
<li><code>for (... in ...)</code> is not guaranteed to return the object properties in sequential order, as one might expect.</li>
<li>Using <code>hasOwnProperty()</code> and <code>!isNaN()</code> checks to filter the object properties is an additional overhead causing it to perform even slower and negates the key reason for using it in the first place, i.e. because of the more concise format.</li>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons an acceptable trade-off between performance and convenience doesn't even exist.  There's really no benefit unless the intent is to handle the array as an <em>object</em> and perform operations on the object properties of the array.</p>

<p>In isolation, there is nothing wrong with using for-in on arrays. For-in iterates over the property names of an object, and in the case of an "out-of-the-box" array, the properties corresponds to the array indexes. (The built-in propertes like <code>length</code>, <code>toString</code> and so on are not included in the iteration.)</p>

<p>However, if your code (or the framework you are using) add custom properties to arrays or to the array prototype, then these properties will be included in the iteration, which is probably not what you want.</p>

<p>Some  JS frameworks, like Prototype modifies the Array prototype. Other frameworks like JQuery doesn't, so with JQuery you can safely use for-in.</p>

<p>If you are in doubt, you probably shouldn't use for-in. </p>

<p>An alternative way of iterating through an array is using a for-loop:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> ix=<span class="hljs-number">0</span>;ix&lt;arr.<span class="hljs-property">length</span>;ix++) <span class="hljs-title function_">alert</span>(ix);
</code></pre>

<p>However, this have a different issue. The issue is that a JavaScript array can have "holes". If you define <code>arr</code> as:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> arr = [<span class="hljs-string">"hello"</span>];
arr[<span class="hljs-number">100</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">"goodbye"</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>Then the array have two items, but a length of 101. Using for-in will yield two indexes, while the for-loop will yield 101 indexes, where the 99 has a value of <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>In addition to the reasons given in other answers, you may not want to use the "for...in" structure if you need to do math with the counter variable because the loop iterates through the names of the object's properties and so the variable is a string.</p>

<p>whereas,</p>

<p>Aside from the fact that <code>for</code>...<code>in</code> loops over all enumerable properties (which is <em>not</em> the same as "all array elements"!), see <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf" rel="noreferrer">http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf</a>, section 12.6.4 (5th edition) or 13.7.5.15 (7th edition):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The mechanics and <strong>order</strong> of enumerating the properties ... <strong>is not specified</strong>...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Emphasis mine.)</p>

<p>That means if a browser wanted to, it could go through the properties in the order in which they were inserted.  Or in numerical order.  Or in lexical order (where "30" comes before "4"!  Keep in mind all object keys -- and thus, all array indexes -- are actually strings, so that makes total sense).  It could go through them by bucket, if it implemented objects as hash tables.  Or take any of that and add "backwards".  A browser could even iterate <em>randomly</em> and be ECMA-262 compliant, as long as it visited each property exactly once.</p>

<p>In practice, most browsers currently like to iterate in roughly the same order.  But there's nothing saying they have to.  That's implementation specific, and could change at any time if another way was found to be far more efficient.</p>

<p>Either way, <code>for</code>...<code>in</code> carries with it no connotation of order.  If you care about order, be explicit about it and use a regular <code>for</code> loop with an index.</p>

<p>Mainly two reasons:</p>

<p><strong>One</strong></p>

<p>Like others have said, You might get keys which aren't in your array or that are inherited from the prototype. So if, let's say, a library adds a property to the Array or Object prototypes:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title class_">Array</span>.<span class="hljs-property"><span class="hljs-keyword">prototype</span></span>.<span class="hljs-property">someProperty</span> = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
</code></pre>

<p>You'll get it as part of every array:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> item <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>]){
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(item) <span class="hljs-comment">// will log 1,2,3 but also "someProperty"</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>you could solve this with the hasOwnProperty method:</p>

<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> item <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> ary){
   <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(ary.<span class="hljs-title function_">hasOwnProperty</span>(item)){
      <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(item) <span class="hljs-comment">// will log only 1,2,3</span>
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>but this is true for iterating over any object with a for-in loop.</p>

<p><strong>Two</strong></p>

<p>Usually the order of the items in an array is important, but the for-in loop won't necessarily iterate in the right order, that's because it treats the array as an object, which is the way it is implemented in JS, and not as an array.
This seems like a small thing, but it can really screw up applications and is hard to debug.</p>

<p>The problem with <code>for ... in ...</code>  and this only becomes a problem when a programmer doesn't really understand the language; it's not really a bug or anything  is that it iterates over <em>all</em> members of an object (well, all <em>enumerable</em> members, but that's a detail for now).  When you want to iterate over <em>just</em> the indexed properties of an array, the only guaranteed way to keep things semantically consistent is to use an integer index (that is, a <code>for (var i = 0; i &lt; array.length; ++i)</code> style loop).</p>

<p>Any object can have arbitrary properties associated with it. There would be nothing terrible about loading additional properties onto an array instance, in particular. Code that wants to see <em>only</em> indexed array-like properties therefore <em>must</em> stick to an integer index. Code that is fully aware of what <code>for ... in</code> does and really <em>need</em> to see all properties, well then that's ok too.</p>

<p><strong>TL&amp;DR:</strong> Using the <code>for in</code> loop in arrays is not evil, in fact quite the opposite.</p>

<p>I think the <code>for in</code> loop is a gem of JS if used <em>correctly</em> in arrays. You are expected to have full control over your software and know what you are doing. Let's see the mentioned drawbacks and disprove them one by one.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>It loops through inherited properties as well:</strong> First of all any extensions to the <code>Array.prototype</code> should have been done by using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/tr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty" rel="noreferrer"><code>Object.defineProperty()</code></a> and their <code>enumerable</code> descriptor should be set to <code>false</code>. Any library not doing so should not be used at all.</li>
<li><strong>Properties those you add to the inheritance chain later get counted:</strong> When doing array sub-classing by <code>Object.setPrototypeOf</code> or by Class <code>extend</code>. You should again use <code>Object.defineProperty()</code> which by default sets the <code>writable</code>, <code>enumerable</code> and <code>configurable</code> property descriptors to <code>false</code>. Lets see an array sub-classing example here...</li>

<p>An important aspect is that <code>for...in</code> only iterates over properties contained in an object which have their <strong>enumerable</strong> <em>property attribute</em> set to true. So if one attempts to iterate over an object using <code>for...in</code> then arbitrary properties may be missed if their enumerable property attribute is false. It is quite possible to alter the enumerable property attribute for normal Array objects so that certain elements are not enumerated. Though in general the property attributes tend to apply to function properties within an object.</p>

<p>One can check the value of a properties' enumerable property attribute by:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">myobject.<span class="hljs-title function_">propertyIsEnumerable</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'myproperty'</span>)

<p>The <code>for</code>/<code>in</code> works with two types of variables: hashtables (associative arrays) and array (non-associative).</p>

<p>JavaScript will automatically determine the way its passes through the items. So if you know that your array is really non-associative you can use <code>for (var i=0; i&lt;=arrayLen; i++)</code>, and skip the auto-detection iteration.</p>

<p>But in my opinion, it's better to use <code>for</code>/<code>in</code>, the process required for that auto-detection is very small. </p>

<p>A real answer for this will depend on how the browser parsers/interpret the JavaScript code. It can change between browsers.</p>

<p>Using the <code>for...in</code> loop for an array is not wrong, although I can guess why someone told you that:</p>

<p>1.) There is already a higher order function, or method, that has that purpose for an array, but has more functionality and leaner syntax, called 'forEach': <code>Array.prototype.forEach(function(element, index, array) {} );</code></p>

<p>2.) Arrays always have a length, but <code>for...in</code> and <code>forEach</code> do not execute a function for any value that is <code>'undefined'</code>, only for the indexes that have a value defined. So if you only assign one value, these loops will only execute a function once, but since an array is enumerated, it will always have a length up to the highest index that has a defined value, but that length could go unnoticed when using these loops.</p>

<p>3.) The standard for loop will execute a function as many times as you define in the parameters, and since an array is numbered, it makes more sense to define how many times you want to execute a function. Unlike the other loops, the for loop can then execute a function for every index in the array, whether the value is defined or not.</p>

<p>In essence, you can use any loop, but you should remember exactly how they work. Understand the conditions upon which the different loops reiterate, their separate functionalities, and realize they will be more or less appropriate for differing scenarios. </p>

<p>Also, it may be considered a better practice to use the <code>forEach</code> method than the <code>for...in</code> loop in general, because it is easier to write and has more functionality, so you may want to get in the habit of only using this method and standard for, but your call.</p>

<p>See below that the first two loops only execute the console.log statements once, while the standard for loop executes the function as many times as specified, in this case, array.length = 6.</p>

<p><strong>for...in</strong> is useful when working on an object in JavaScript, but not for an Array, but still we can not say it's a wrong way, but it's not recommended, look at this example below using <strong>for...in</strong> loop:</p>

<p>OK, let's do it with <strong>Array</strong> now:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> txt = <span class="hljs-string">""</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> person = [<span class="hljs-string">"Alireza"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Dezfoolian"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">35</span>];

<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(txt); <span class="hljs-comment">//Alireza Dezfoolian 35 </span>

<p>As you see the result the same...</p>

<p>But let's try something, let's prototype something to <strong>Array</strong>...</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title class_">Array</span>.<span class="hljs-property"><span class="hljs-keyword">prototype</span></span>.<span class="hljs-property">someoneelse</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"someoneelse"</span>;

<p>Now we create a new Array();</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> txt = <span class="hljs-string">""</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> arr = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Array</span>();
arr[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">'Alireza'</span>;

arr[<span class="hljs-number">2</span>] = <span class="hljs-number">35</span>;

</code></pre>

<p>You see the <strong>someoneelse</strong>!!!... We actually looping through new Array object in this case!</p>

<p>So that's one of the reasons why we need to use <strong>for..in</strong> carefully, but it's not always the case...</p>

Or in numerical order.  Or in lexical order (where \u0026quot;30\u0026quot; comes before \u0026quot;4\u0026quot;!  Keep in mind all object keys -- and thus, all array indexes -- are actually strings, so that makes total sense).  It could go through them by bucket, if it implemented objects as hash tables.  Or take any of that and add \u0026quot;backwards\u0026quot;.  A browser could even iterate \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;randomly\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; and be ECMA-262 compliant, as long as it visited each property exactly once.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In practice, most browsers currently like to iterate in roughly the same order.  But there\u0026apos;s nothing saying they have to.

If you were only expecting integers, oops.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You should use the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;for(var x in y)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; only on property lists, not on objects (as explained above).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Using the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;for...in\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; loop for an array is not wrong, although I can guess why someone told you that:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;1.) There is already a higher order function, or method, that has that purpose for an array, but has more functionality and leaner syntax, called \u0026apos;forEach\u0026apos;: \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Array.prototype.forEach(function(element, index, array) {} );\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;2.) Arrays always have a length, but \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;for...in\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;forEach\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; do not execute a function for any value that is \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;\u0026apos;undefined\u0026apos;\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, only for the indexes that have a value defined. So if you only assign one value, these loops will only execute a function once, but since an array is enumerated, it will always have a length up to the highest index that has a defined value, but that length could go unnoticed when using these loops.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;3.) The standard for loop will execute a function as many times as you define in the parameters, and since an array is numbered, it makes more sense to define how many times you want to execute a function. Unlike the other loops, the for loop can then execute a function for every index in the array, whether the value is defined or not.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In essence, you can use any loop, but you should remember exactly how they work. Understand the conditions upon which the different loops reiterate, their separate functionalities, and realize they will be more or less appropriate for differing scenarios. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Also, it may be considered a better practice to use the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;forEach\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; method than the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;for...in\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; loop in general, because it is easier to write and has more functionality, so you may want to get in the habit of only using this method and standard for, but your call.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;See below that the first two loops only execute the console.log statements once, while the standard for loop executes the function as many times as specified, in this case, array.length = 6.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-js s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;var\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;
