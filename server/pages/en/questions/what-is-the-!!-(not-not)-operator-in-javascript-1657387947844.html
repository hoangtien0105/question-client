There is a use-case where we might want to know the truth about a value, even if we expect the value to be false (or falsey), or if we expect the value not to be typeof boolean.\n\nIn practice:\nConsider a concise function which detects feature functionality (and in this case, platform compatibility) by way of dynamic typing (aka &quot;duck typing&quot;). We want to write a function that returns true if a user&apos;s browser supports the HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; element, but we don&apos;t want the function to throw an error if &lt;audio&gt; is undefined; and we don&apos;t want to use try ... catch to handle any possible errors (because they&apos;re gross); and also we don&apos;t want to use a check inside the function that won&apos;t consistently reveal the truth about the feature (for example, document.createElement(&apos;audio&apos;) will still create an element called &lt;audio&gt; even if HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; is not supported).\n\nHere are the three approaches:\n// this won&apos;t tell us anything about HTML5 `&lt;audio&gt;` as a feature\nvar foo = function(tag, atr) { return document.createElement(tag)[atr]; }\n\n// this won&apos;t return true if the feature is detected (although it works just fine)\nvar bar = function(tag, atr) { return !document.createElement(tag)[atr]; }\n\n// this is the concise, feature-detecting solution we want\nvar baz = function(tag, atr) { return !!document.createElement(tag)[atr]; }\n\nfoo(&apos;audio&apos;, &apos;preload&apos;); // returns &quot;auto&quot;\nbar(&apos;audio&apos;, &apos;preload&apos;); // returns false\nbaz(&apos;audio&apos;, &apos;preload&apos;); // returns true\n\nEach function accepts an argument for a &lt;tag&gt; and an attribute to look for, but they each return different values based on what the comparisons determine.\nBut wait, there&apos;s more!\nSome of you probably noticed that in this specific example, one could simply check for a property using the slightly more performant means of checking if the object in question has a property. There are two ways to do this:\n// the native `hasOwnProperty` method\nvar qux = function(tag, atr) { return document.createElement(tag).hasOwnProperty(atr); }\n\n// the `in` operator\nvar quux = function(tag, atr) { return atr in document.createElement(tag); }\n\nqux(&apos;audio&apos;, &apos;preload&apos;);  // returns true\nquux(&apos;audio&apos;, &apos;preload&apos;); // returns true\n\nWe digress...\nHowever rare these situations may be, there may exist a few scenarios where the most concise, most performant, and thus most preferred means of getting true from a non-boolean, possibly undefined value is indeed by using !!.

Yes, !!X could be read as &quot;the truthiness of X [represented as a boolean]&quot;. But !! isn&apos;t, practically speaking, so important for figuring out whether a single variable is (or even if many variables are) truthy or falsy. !!myVar === true is the same as just myVar. Comparing !!X to a &quot;real&quot; boolean isn&apos;t really useful.\nThe only thing you gain with !! is the ability to check the truthiness of multiple variables against each other in a repeatable, standardized (and JSLint friendly) fashion.\nSimply casting :(\nThat is...\n\n0 === false is false.\n!!0 === false is true.\n\nThe above&apos;s not so useful. if (!0) gives you the same results as if (!!0 === false). I can&apos;t think of a good case for casting a variable to boolean and then comparing to a &quot;true&quot; boolean.\nSee &quot;== and !=&quot; from JSLint&apos;s directions (note: Crockford is moving his site around a bit; that link is liable to die at some point) for a little on why:\n\nThe == and != operators do type coercion before comparing. This is bad because it causes &apos; \\t\\r\\n&apos; == 0 to be true. This can mask type errors. JSLint cannot reliably determine if == is being used correctly, so it is best to not use == and != at all and to always use the more reliable === and !== operators instead.\nIf you only care that a value is truthy or falsy, then use the short form. Instead of\n    (foo != 0)\njust say\n    (foo)\nand instead of\n    (foo == 0)\nsay\n     (!foo)\n\nNote that there are some unintuitive cases where a boolean will be cast to a number (true is cast to 1 and false to 0) when comparing a boolean to a number. In this case, !! might be mentally useful. Though, again, these are cases where you&apos;re comparing a non-boolean to a hard-typed boolean, which is, imo, a serious mistake. if (-1) is still the way to go here.\n\n               Original                    Equivalent       Result   \n\n if (-1 == true) console.log(&quot;spam&quot;)    if (-1 == 1)       undefined \n if (-1 == false) console.log(&quot;spam&quot;)   if (-1 == 0)       undefined \n   Order doesn&apos;t matter...                                           \n if (true == -1) console.log(&quot;spam&quot;)    if (1 == -1)       undefined \n\n if (!!-1 == true) console.log(&quot;spam&quot;)  if (true == true)  spam       better\n\n if (-1) console.log(&quot;spam&quot;)            if (truthy)        spam       still best\n\n\nAnd things get even crazier depending on your engine. WScript, for instance, wins the prize.\nfunction test()\n{\n    return (1 === 1);\n}\nWScript.echo(test());\n\nBecause of some historical Windows jive, that&apos;ll output -1 in a message box! Try it in a cmd.exe prompt and see! But WScript.echo(-1 == test()) still gives you 0, or WScript&apos;s false. Look away. It&apos;s hideous.\nComparing truthiness :)\nBut what if I have two values I need to check for equal truthi/falsi-ness?\nPretend we have myVar1 = 0; and myVar2 = undefined;.\n\nmyVar1 === myVar2 is 0 === undefined and is obviously false.\n!!myVar1 === !!myVar2 is !!0 === !!undefined and is true! Same truthiness! (In this case, both &quot;have a truthiness of falsy&quot;.)\n\nSo the only place you&apos;d really need to use &quot;boolean-cast variables&quot; would be if you had a situation where you&apos;re checking if both variables have the same truthiness, right? That is, use !! if you need to see if two vars are both truthy or both falsy (or not), that is, of equal (or not) truthiness.\nI can&apos;t think of a great, non-contrived use case for that offhand. Maybe you have &quot;linked&quot; fields in a form?\nif (!!customerInput.spouseName !== !!customerInput.spouseAge ) {\n    errorObjects.spouse = &quot;Please either enter a valid name AND age &quot; \n        + &quot;for your spouse or leave all spouse fields blank.&quot;;\n}\n\nSo now if you have a truthy for both or a falsy for both spouse name and age, you can continue. Otherwise you&apos;ve only got one field with a value (or a very early arranged marriage) and need to create an extra error on your errorObjects collection.\nThough even in this case, the !! really is superfluous. One ! was enough to cast to a boolean, and you&apos;re just checking equality.\n\nEDIT 24 Oct 2017, 6 Feb 19:\n3rd party libraries that expect explicit Boolean values\nHere&apos;s an interesting case... !! might be useful when 3rd party libs expect explicit Boolean values.\nReact\nFor instance, False in JSX (React) has a special meaning that&apos;s not triggered on simple falsiness. If you tried returning something like the following in your JSX, expecting an int in messageCount...\n{messageCount &amp;&amp; &lt;div&gt;You have messages!&lt;/div&gt;}\n... you might be surprised to see React render a 0 when you have zero messages. You have to explicitly return false for JSX not to render. The above statement returns 0, which JSX happily renders, as it should. It can&apos;t tell you didn&apos;t have Count: {messageCount}.\n\nOne fix involves the bangbang, which coerces 0 into !!0, which is false:\n{!!messageCount &amp;&amp; &lt;div&gt;You have messages!&lt;/div&gt;}\n\nJSX&apos; docs suggest you be more explicit, write self-commenting code, and use a comparison to force to a Boolean.\n{messageCount &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; &lt;div&gt;You have messages!&lt;/div&gt;}\n\nI&apos;m more comfortable handling falsiness myself with a ternary --\n{messageCount ? &lt;div&gt;You have messages!&lt;/div&gt; : false}\n\n\nTypescript\nSame deal in Typescript: If you have a function that returns a boolean (or you&apos;re assigning a value to a boolean variable), you [usually] can&apos;t return/assign a boolean-y value; it has to be a strongly typed boolean. This means, iff myObject is strongly typed, return !myObject; works for a function returning a boolean, but return myObject; doesn&apos;t. You have to return !!myObject (or cast to the proper boolean another way) to match Typescript&apos;s expectations.\n\nThe exception for Typescript? If myObject was an any, you&apos;re back in JavaScript&apos;s Wild West and can return it without !!, even if your return type is a boolean.\n\nKeep in mind that these are JSX &amp; Typescript conventions, not ones inherent to JavaScript.\nBut if you see strange 0s in your rendered JSX, think loose falsy management.\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/what-is-the-!!-(not-not)-operator-in-javascript-1657387947844#solution7","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"It&apos;s just the logical NOT operator, twice - it&apos;s used to convert something to boolean, e.g.:\n\ntrue === !!10\n\nfalse === !!0\n\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/what-is-the-!!-(not-not)-operator-in-javascript-1657387947844#solution8","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"It converts the suffix to a Boolean value. \n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/what-is-the-!!-(not-not)-operator-in-javascript-1657387947844#solution9","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"It&apos;s a double not operation.

Because document.getElementById() is a &quot;truthy&quot; expression that will evaluate as true in this if() statement, but it is not an actual boolean value of true.\n\nThe double &quot;not&quot; in this case is quite simple.  It is simply two nots back to back. \n\nThe first one simply &quot;inverts&quot; the truthy or falsey value, resulting in an actual boolean type, and then the second one &quot;inverts&quot; it back again to it&apos;s original state, but now in an actual boolean value.  That way you have consistency:\n\nif (!!document.getElementById(&apos;myElement&apos;)) {}\n\n\nand \n\nif (!!document.getElementById(&apos;myElement&apos;) == true) {}\n\n\nwill BOTH return true, as expected.\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/what-is-the-!!-(not-not)-operator-in-javascript-1657387947844#solution18","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I suspect this is a leftover from C++ where people override the ! operator but not the bool operator.\n\nSo to get a negative(or positive) answer in that case you would first need to use the ! operator to get a boolean, but if you wanted to check the positive case would use !!.\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/what-is-the-!!-(not-not)-operator-in-javascript-1657387947844#solution19","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"The if and while statements and the ? operator use truth values to determine which branch of code to run. For example, zero and NaN numbers and the empty string are false, but other numbers and strings are true. Objects are true, but the undefined value and null are both false.\n\nThe double negation operator !! calculates the truth value of a value. It&apos;s actually two operators, where !!x means !(!x), and behaves as follows:\n\n\nIf x is a false value, !x is true, and !!x is false.\nIf x is a true value, !x is false, and !!x is true.\n\n\nWhen used at the top level of a Boolean context (if, while, or ?), the !! operator is behaviorally a no-op. For example, if (x) and if (!!x) mean the same thing.\n\nPractical uses\n\nHowever it has several practical uses.\n\nOne use is to lossily compress an object to its truth value, so that your code isn&apos;t holding a reference to a big object and keeping it alive. Assigning !!some_big_object to a variable instead of some_big_object lets go of it for the garbage collector. This is useful for cases that produce either an object or a false value such as null or the undefined value, such as browser feature detection.\n\nAnother use, which I mentioned in an answer about C&apos;s corresponding !! operator, is with &quot;lint&quot; tools that look for common typos and print diagnostics. For example, in both C and JavaScript, a few common typos for Boolean operations produce other behaviors whose output isn&apos;t quite as Boolean:\n\n\nif (a = b) is assignment followed by use of the truth value of b; if (a == b) is an equality comparison.\nif (a &amp; b) is a bitwise AND; if (a &amp;&amp; b) is a logical AND. 2 &amp; 5 is 0 (a false value); 2 &amp;&amp; 5 is true.\n\n\nThe !! operator reassures the lint tool that what you wrote is what you meant: do this operation, then take the truth value of the result.\n\nA third use is to produce logical XOR and logical XNOR. In both C and JavaScript, a &amp;&amp; b performs a logical AND (true if both sides are true), and a &amp; b performs a bitwise AND. a || b performs a logical OR (true if at least one are true), and a | b performs a bitwise OR. There&apos;s a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) as a ^ b, but there&apos;s no built-in operator for logical XOR (true if exactly one side is true).

Another way of doing the above (b &amp;&amp; b.foo) is (b || {}).foo.

<p><code>!!</code> is not an operator. It is the double-use of <code>!</code> -- which is the logical "not" operator.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>In theory:</strong></p>
<p><strong><code>!</code></strong> determines the "truth" of what a value is not:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The truth is that <code>false</code> is not <code>true</code> (that's why <code>!false</code> results

<ul>
<li><p>The truth is that <code>true</code> is not <em>not</em> <code>true</code> (that's why <code>!!true</code> results in <strong><code>true</code></strong>)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The truth is that <code>false</code> is not <em>not</em> <code>false</code> (that's why <code>!!false</code> results in <strong><code>false</code></strong>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>What we wish to determine in the comparison is the "truth" <em>about</em> the value of a reference, not the <em>value of</em> the reference itself. There is a use-case where we might want to know the truth about a value, even if we expect the value to be <em><code>false</code></em> (or falsey), or if we expect the value not to be typeof <code>boolean</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>In practice:</strong></p>
<p>Consider a concise function which detects feature functionality (and in this case, platform compatibility) by way of <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Dynamic_typing" rel="noreferrer">dynamic typing</a></strong> (aka "duck typing"). We want to write a function that returns <code>true</code> if a user's browser supports the HTML5 <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> element, but we don't want the function to throw an error if <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> is undefined; and we don't want to use <code>try ... catch</code> to handle any possible errors (because they're gross); <em>and also</em> we don't want to use a check inside the function that won't consistently reveal the truth about the feature (for example, <code>document.createElement('audio')</code> will still create an element called <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> even if HTML5 <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> is not supported).</p>
<hr>
<p>Here are the three approaches:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// this won't tell us anything about HTML5 `&lt;audio&gt;` as a feature</span>

<p>Each function accepts an argument for a <code>&lt;tag&gt;</code> and an <code>attribute</code> to look for, but they each return different values based on what the comparisons determine.</p>
<p><strong>But wait, there's more!</strong></p>
<p>Some of you probably noticed that in this specific example, one could simply check for a property using the slightly <strong><a href="http://jsperf.com/hasownproperty-vs-comparison" rel="noreferrer">more performant</a></strong> means of checking if the object in question <em>has</em> a property. There are two ways to do this:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// the native `hasOwnProperty` method</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> qux = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">tag, atr</span>) { <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">createElement</span>(tag).<span class="hljs-title function_">hasOwnProperty</span>(atr); }

</code></pre>
<p><strong>We digress...</strong></p>
<p>However rare these situations may be, there may exist a few scenarios where the most concise, most performant, and thus most preferred means of getting <code>true</code> from a non-boolean, possibly undefined value is indeed by using <code>!!</code>. Hopefully this ridiculously clears it up.</p>

<p><code>!!</code> converts the value to the right of it to its equivalent boolean value. (Think poor man's way of "type-casting"). Its <em>intent</em> is usually to convey to the reader that the code does not care <em>what</em> value is in the variable, but what it's <a href="http://11heavens.com/falsy-and-truthy-in-javascript" rel="noreferrer">"truth" value</a> is.</p>

<p><code>!!foo</code> applies the unary not operator twice and is used to cast to boolean type similar to the use of unary plus <code>+foo</code> to cast to number and concatenating an empty string <code>''+foo</code> to cast to string.</p>

<p>Instead of these hacks, you can also use the constructor functions corresponding to the primitive types (<em>without</em> using <code>new</code>) to explicitly cast values, ie</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title class_">Boolean</span>(foo) === !!foo

<p>So many answers doing half the work. Yes, <code>!!X</code> could be read as "the truthiness of X [represented as a boolean]". But <code>!!</code> isn't, practically speaking, so important for figuring out whether a single variable is (or even if many variables are) truthy or falsy. <code>!!myVar === true</code> is the same as just <code>myVar</code>. Comparing <code>!!X</code> to a "real" boolean isn't really useful.</p>
<p>The only thing you gain with <code>!!</code> is the ability to check the truthiness of multiple variables <em>against each other</em> in a repeatable, standardized (and JSLint friendly) fashion.</p>
<h3 id="simply-casting-0vbq">Simply casting :(</h3>
<p>That is...</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0 === false</code> is <code>false</code>.</li>
<li><code>!!0 === false</code> is <code>true</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above's not so useful. <code>if (!0)</code> gives you the same results as <code>if (!!0 === false)</code>. I can't think of a good case for casting a variable to boolean and then comparing to a "true" boolean.</p>
<p>See "== and !=" from <a href="http://old.jslint.com/lint.html" rel="noreferrer">JSLint's directions</a> (note: Crockford is moving his site around a bit; that link is liable to die at some point) for a little on why:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The == and != operators do type coercion before comparing. This is bad because it causes ' \t\r\n' == 0 to be true. This can mask type errors. JSLint cannot reliably determine if == is being used correctly, so it is best to not use == and != at all and to always use the more reliable === and !== operators instead.</p>
<p>If you only care that a value is truthy or falsy, then use the short form. Instead of<br>
<code>    (foo != 0)</code></p>
<p>just say<br>
<code>    (foo)</code></p>
<p>and instead of<br>
<code>    (foo == 0)</code></p>
<p>say<br>
<code>     (!foo)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that there are some <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3619813/1028230">unintuitive cases</a> where a boolean will be cast to a number (<code>true</code> is cast to <code>1</code> and <code>false</code> to <code>0</code>) when comparing a boolean to a number. In this case, <code>!!</code> might be mentally useful. Though, again, <strong>these are cases where you're comparing a non-boolean to a hard-typed boolean, which is, imo, a serious mistake.</strong> <code>if (-1)</code> is still the way to go here.</p>

</ul>
<p>So the only place you'd really need to use "boolean-cast variables" would be if you had a situation where you're checking if both variables have the <em>same</em> truthiness, right? That is, <b>use <code>!!</code> if you need to see if two vars are <em>both truthy or both falsy</em> (or not), that is, <em>of equal</em> (or not) <em>truthiness</em>.</b></p>
<p>I can't think of a great, non-contrived use case for that offhand. Maybe you have "linked" fields in a form?</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!!customerInput.<span class="hljs-property">spouseName</span> !== !!customerInput.<span class="hljs-property">spouseAge</span> ) {
    errorObjects.<span class="hljs-property">spouse</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"Please either enter a valid name AND age "</span> 
        + <span class="hljs-string">"for your spouse or leave all spouse fields blank."</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>So now if you have a truthy for both <em>or</em> a falsy for both spouse name and age, you can continue. Otherwise you've only got one field with a value (or a very early arranged marriage) and need to create an extra error on your <code>errorObjects</code> collection.</p>
<p>Though even in this case, the <code>!!</code> really is superfluous. One <code>!</code> was enough to cast to a boolean, and you're just checking equality.</p>

<h2 id="rd-party-libraries-that-expect-explicit-boolean-values-858l">3rd party libraries that expect explicit Boolean values</h2>
<p>Here's an interesting case... <code>!!</code> might be useful when 3rd party libs expect explicit Boolean values.</p>
<h3 id="react-i9z0">React</h3>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://react-cn.github.io/react/tips/false-in-jsx.html" rel="noreferrer">False in JSX (React) has a special meaning</a> that's not triggered on simple falsiness. If you tried returning something like the following in your JSX, expecting an int in <code>messageCount</code>...</p>
<p><code>{messageCount &amp;&amp; &lt;div&gt;You have messages!&lt;/div&gt;}</code></p>
<p>... you might be surprised to see React render a <code>0</code> when you have zero messages. You have to explicitly return false for JSX not to render. The above statement returns <code>0</code>, which JSX happily renders, as it should. It can't tell you didn't have <code>Count: {messageCount}</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One fix involves the bangbang, which coerces <code>0</code> into <code>!!0</code>, which is <code>false</code>:<br>
<code>{!!messageCount &amp;&amp; &lt;div&gt;You have messages!&lt;/div&gt;}</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>JSX' docs suggest you be more explicit, write self-commenting code, and use a comparison to force to a Boolean.<br>
<code>{messageCount &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; &lt;div&gt;You have messages!&lt;/div&gt;}</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>I'm more comfortable handling falsiness myself with a ternary --<br>
<code>{messageCount ? &lt;div&gt;You have messages!&lt;/div&gt; : false}</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="typescript-dg8f">Typescript</h3>
<p>Same deal in Typescript: If you have a function that returns a boolean (or you're assigning a value to a boolean variable), you [usually] can't return/assign a boolean-y value; it has to be a strongly typed boolean. This means, <strong>iff <code>myObject</code> is strongly typed</strong>, <code>return !myObject;</code> works for a function returning a boolean, but <code>return myObject;</code> doesn't. You have to <code>return !!myObject</code> (or cast to the proper boolean another way) to match Typescript's expectations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The exception for Typescript? If <code>myObject</code> was an <code>any</code>, you're back in JavaScript's Wild West and can return it without <code>!!</code>, even if your return type is a boolean.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind that <strong>these <em>are JSX &amp; Typescript conventions</em>, not ones inherent to JavaScript</strong>.</p>
<p>But if you see strange <code>0</code>s in your rendered JSX, think loose falsy management.</p>

<p>It simulates the behavior of the <code>Boolean()</code> casting function.
The first <code>NOT</code> returns a Boolean value no matter what operand it is given. The second <code>NOT</code> negates that <code>Boolean</code> value and so gives the <code>true</code> Boolean value of a variable. The end result is the same as using the <code>Boolean()</code> function on a value.</p>

<p><code>!!</code> it's using <code>NOT</code> operation twice together, <code>!</code> convert the value to a <code>boolean</code> and reverse it, so using it twice, showing the boolean(false or true) of that value. here is a simple example to see how <code>!!</code> works:</p>
<p>At first, the place you have:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> zero = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>Then you do <code>!0</code>, it will be converted to boolean and be evaluated to <code>true</code>, because 0 is <code>falsy</code>, so you get the reversed value and converted to boolean, so it gets evaluated to <code>true</code>.</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">!zero; <span class="hljs-comment">//true</span>
</code></pre>
<p>but we don't want the reversed <strong>boolean version</strong> of the value, so we can reverse it again to get our result! That's why we use another <code>!</code>.</p>
<p>Basically, <code>!!</code> make us sure, the value we get is boolean, not falsy, truthy or string etc...</p>
<p>So  it's like using <code>Boolean</code> function in javascript, but easy and shorter way to convert a value to boolean:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> zero = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;

<p>! is "boolean not", which essentially typecasts the value of "enable" to its boolean opposite. The second ! flips this value. So, <code>!!enable</code> means "not not enable," giving you the value of <code>enable</code> as a boolean.</p>

<p>I think worth mentioning is, that a condition combined with logical AND/OR will not return a boolean value but last success or first fail in case of &amp;&amp; and 
first success or last fail in case of || of condition chain.</p>

<p>This question has been answered quite thoroughly, but I'd like to add an answer that I hope is as simplified as possible, making the meaning of !! as simple to grasp as can be.</p>

<p>Because javascript has what are called "truthy" and "falsey" values, there are expressions that when evaluated in other expressions will result in a true or false condition, even though the value or expression being examined is not actually <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>For instance: </p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">getElementById</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'myElement'</span>)) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// code block</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>If that element does in fact exist, the expression will evaluate as true, and the code block will be executed.</p>

<p>However:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">getElementById</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'myElement'</span>) == <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// code block</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>...will NOT result in a true condition, and the code block will not be executed, even if the element does exist.  </p>

<p>Why?  Because <code>document.getElementById()</code> is a "truthy" expression that will evaluate as true in this <code>if()</code> statement, but it is not an actual boolean value of <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>The double "not" in this case is quite simple.  It is simply two <code>not</code>s back to back. </p>

<p>The first one simply "inverts" the truthy or falsey value, resulting in an actual boolean type, and then the second one "inverts" it back again to it's original state, but now in an actual boolean value.  That way you have consistency:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!!<span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">getElementById</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'myElement'</span>)) {}
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!!<span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">getElementById</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'myElement'</span>) == <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>) {}
</code></pre>

<p>will BOTH return true, as expected.</p>

<p>I suspect this is a leftover from C++ where people override the ! operator but not the bool operator.</p>

<p>So to get a negative(or positive) answer in that case you would first need to use the ! operator to get a boolean, but if you wanted to check the positive case would use !!.</p>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution20" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl solution-inner border md:px-10 md:py-10 px-2 py-10 shadow-md bg-white"><div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-between"><h1 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 20</h1><div class="tags-wrap h-max space-x-8"><div class="tags"></div></div></div><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>The <code>if</code> and <code>while</code> statements and the <code>?</code> operator use truth values to determine which branch of code to run. For example, zero and NaN numbers and the empty string are false, but other numbers and strings are true. Objects are true, but the undefined value and <code>null</code> are both false.</p>

<p>The double negation operator <code>!!</code> calculates the truth value of a value. It's actually two operators, where <code>!!x</code> means <code>!(!x)</code>, and behaves as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>If <code>x</code> is a false value, <code>!x</code> is <code>true</code>, and <code>!!x</code> is <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>x</code> is a true value, <code>!x</code> is <code>false</code>, and <code>!!x</code> is <code>true</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>When used at the top level of a Boolean context (<code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, or <code>?</code>), the <code>!!</code> operator is behaviorally a no-op. For example, <code>if (x)</code> and <code>if (!!x)</code> mean the same thing.</p>

<h2>Practical uses</h2>

<p>However it has several practical uses.</p>

<p>One use is to lossily compress an object to its truth value, so that your code isn't holding a reference to a big object and keeping it alive. Assigning <code>!!some_big_object</code> to a variable instead of <code>some_big_object</code> lets go of it for the garbage collector. This is useful for cases that produce either an object or a false value such as <code>null</code> or the undefined value, such as browser feature detection.</p>

<p>Another use, which I mentioned in an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/35525827/2738262">answer about C's corresponding <code>!!</code> operator</a>, is with "lint" tools that look for common typos and print diagnostics. For example, in both C and JavaScript, a few common typos for Boolean operations produce other behaviors whose output isn't quite as Boolean:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>if (a = b)</code> is assignment followed by use of the truth value of <code>b</code>; <code>if (a == b)</code> is an equality comparison.</li>
<li><code>if (a &amp; b)</code> is a bitwise AND; <code>if (a &amp;&amp; b)</code> is a logical AND. <code>2 &amp; 5</code> is <code>0</code> (a false value); <code>2 &amp;&amp; 5</code> is true.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>!!</code> operator reassures the lint tool that what you wrote is what you meant: do this operation, then take the truth value of the result.</p>

<p>A third use is to produce logical XOR and logical XNOR. In both C and JavaScript, <code>a &amp;&amp; b</code> performs a logical AND (true if both sides are true), and <code>a &amp; b</code> performs a bitwise AND. <code>a || b</code> performs a logical OR (true if at least one are true), and <code>a | b</code> performs a bitwise OR. There's a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) as <code>a ^ b</code>, but there's no built-in operator for logical XOR (true if exactly one side is true). You might, for example, want to allow the user to enter text in exactly one of two fields. What you can do is convert each to a truth value and compare them: <code>!!x !== !!y</code>.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The trick here is the chain of <code>&amp;&amp;</code>s will return <strong>the first falsey value</strong> it finds -- and this can be fed to an if statement etc.  So if b.foo is undefined, it will return undefined and skip the <code>b.foo.bar</code> statement, and we get no error.</p>
<p>The above return undefined but if you have an empty string, false, null, 0, undefined those values will return and soon as we encounter them in the chain -- <code>[]</code> and <code>{}</code> are both "truthy" and we will continue down the so-called "&amp;&amp; chain" to the next value to the right.</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Another way of doing the above (<code>b &amp;&amp; b.foo</code>) is <code>(b || {}).foo</code>.  Those are equivalent, because if b is undefined then <code>b || {}</code> will be <code>{}</code>, and you'll be accessing a value in an empty object (no error) instead of trying to access a value within "undefined" (causes an error).</p>
<p>So, <code>(b || {}).foo</code> is the same as <code>b &amp;&amp; b.foo</code> and <code>((b || {}).foo || {}).bar</code> is the same as <code>b &amp;&amp; b.foo &amp;&amp; b.foo.bar</code>.</p>

<p>Tons of great answers here, but if you've read down this far, this helped me to 'get it'. Open the console on Chrome (etc), and start typing:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">!(!(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>))
!(!(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>))
!(!(<span class="hljs-string">'truthy'</span>))

!(!(<span class="hljs-string">''</span>))
!(!(<span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span>))
!(!(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Object</span>())
!(!({}))
woo = <span class="hljs-string">'hoo'</span>
!(!(woo))
...etc, etc, until the light goes on ;)
</code></pre>

<p>Naturally, these are all the same as merely typing !!someThing, but the added parentheses might help make it more understandable.</p>

<p>After seeing all these great answers, I would like to add another reason for using  <code>!!</code>. Currenty I'm working in Angular 2-4 (TypeScript) and I want to return a boolean as <code>false</code> when my user is not authenticated. If he isn't authenticated, the token-string would be <code>null</code> or <code>""</code>. I can do this by using the next block of code:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">public <span class="hljs-title function_">isAuthenticated</span>(): boolean {
   <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> !!<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">getToken</span>();
}
</code></pre>

<p>here is a piece of code from angular js </p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> requestAnimationFrame = $window.<span class="hljs-property">requestAnimationFrame</span> ||
                                $window.<span class="hljs-property">webkitRequestAnimationFrame</span> ||
                                $window.<span class="hljs-property">mozRequestAnimationFrame</span>;

 <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> rafSupported = !!requestAnimationFrame;
</code></pre>

<p>their intention is to set rafSupported to true or false based on the availability of function in requestAnimationFrame </p>

<p>it can be achieved by checking in following way in general:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span>  requestAnimationFrame === <span class="hljs-string">'function'</span>)
rafSupported =<span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>
rafSupported =<span class="hljs-literal">false</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>the short way could be using !!</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">rafSupported = !!requestAnimationFrame ;
</code></pre>

<p>so if requestAnimationFrame was assigned a function
 then
!requestAnimationFrame would be false and one more ! of it would be true</p>

<p>if requestAnimationFrame was assinged undefined then
!requestAnimationFrame would be true and one more ! of it would be false</p>

<p>It is important to remember the evaluations to <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> in <strong>JavaScript</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Everything with a "Value" is <code>true</code> (namely <strong>truthy</strong>), for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>101</code>,</li>
<li><code>3.1415</code>,</li>
<li><code>-11</code>,</li>
<li><code>"Lucky Brain"</code>,</li>
<li><code>new Object()</code></li>
<li>and, of course, <code>true</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Everything without a "Value" is <code>false</code> (namely <strong>falsy</strong>), for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0</code>,</li>
<li><code>-0</code>,</li>
<li><code>""</code> (empty string),</li>
<li><code>undefined</code>,</li>
<li><code>null</code>,</li>
<li><code>NaN</code> (not a number)</li>
<li>and, of course, <code>false</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Applying the "<strong>logical not</strong>" operator (<code>!</code>) evaluates the operand, converting it to <code>boolean</code> and then negating it.  Applying it twice will negate the negation, effectively converting the value to <code>boolean</code>.  Not applying the operator will just be a regular assignment of the exact value.  Examples:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> value = <span class="hljs-number">23</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// number</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> valueAsNegatedBoolean = !value; <span class="hljs-comment">// boolean falsy (because 23 is truthy)</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> valueAsBoolean = !!value; <span class="hljs-comment">// boolean truthy</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> copyOfValue = value; <span class="hljs-comment">// number 23</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> value2 = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> value2AsNegatedBoolean = !value2; <span class="hljs-comment">// boolean truthy (because 0 is falsy)</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> value2AsBoolean = !!value2; <span class="hljs-comment">// boolean falsy</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> copyOfValue2 = value2; <span class="hljs-comment">// number 0</span>
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><code>value2 = value;</code> assigns the exact object <code>value</code> even if it is not <code>boolean</code> hence <code>value2</code> won't necessarily end up being <code>boolean</code>.</li>
<li><code>value2 = !!value;</code> assigns a guaranteed <code>boolean</code> as the result of the double negation of the operand <code>value</code> and it is equivalent to the following but much shorter and readable:</li>

For example, \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;if (x)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;if (!!x)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; mean the same thing.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Practical uses\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;However it has several practical uses.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;One use is to lossily compress an object to its truth value, so that your code isn\u0026apos;t holding a reference to a big object and keeping it alive. Assigning \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;!!some_big_object\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to a variable instead of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;some_big_object\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; lets go of it for the garbage collector. This is useful for cases that produce either an object or a false value such as \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;null\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; or the undefined value, such as browser feature detection.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Another use, which I mentioned in an \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/35525827/2738262\u0026quot;\u0026gt;answer about C\u0026apos;s corresponding \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;!!\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; operator\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, is with \u0026quot;lint\u0026quot; tools that look for common typos and print diagnostics. For example, in both C and JavaScript, a few common typos for Boolean operations produce other behaviors whose output isn\u0026apos;t quite as Boolean:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;if (a = b)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is assignment followed by use of the truth value of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;b\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;; \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;if (a == b)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is an equality comparison.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;if (a \u0026amp;amp; b)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is a bitwise AND; \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;if (a \u0026amp;amp;\u0026amp;amp; b)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is a logical AND. \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;2 \u0026amp;amp; 5\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;0\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; (a false value); \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;2 \u0026amp;amp;\u0026amp;amp; 5\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is true.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;!!\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; operator reassures the lint tool that what you wrote is what you meant: do this operation, then take the truth value of the result.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A third use is to produce logical XOR and logical XNOR. In both C and JavaScript, \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;a \u0026amp;amp;\u0026amp;amp; b\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; performs a logical AND (true if both sides are true), and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;a \u0026amp;amp; b\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; performs a bitwise AND. \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;a || b\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; performs a logical OR (true if at least one are true), and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;a | b\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; performs a bitwise OR. There\u0026apos;s a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) as \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;a ^ b\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, but there\u0026apos;s no built-in operator for logical XOR (true if exactly one side is true). You might, for example, want to allow the user to enter text in exactly one of two fields. What you can do is convert each to a truth value and compare them: \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;!!x !== !!y\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Double boolean negation.
