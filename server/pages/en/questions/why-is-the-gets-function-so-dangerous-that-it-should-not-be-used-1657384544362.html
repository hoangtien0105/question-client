Most C implementations still support it, but at least gcc issues a warning for any code that uses it.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Why is gets() dangerous\n\nThe first internet worm (the Morris Internet Worm) escaped about 30 years ago (1988-11-02), and it used gets() and a buffer overflow as one of its methods of propagating from system to system. The basic problem is that the function doesn&apos;t know how big the buffer is, so it continues reading until it finds a newline or encounters EOF, and may overflow the bounds of the buffer it was given.\n\nYou should forget you ever heard that gets() existed.\n\nThe C11 standard ISO/IEC 9899:2011 eliminated gets() as a standard function, which is A Good Thing (it was formally marked as &apos;obsolescent&apos; and &apos;deprecated&apos; in ISO/IEC 9899:1999/Cor.3:2007  Technical Corrigendum 3 for C99, and then removed in C11).  Sadly, it will remain in libraries for many years (meaning &apos;decades&apos;) for reasons of backwards compatibility. If it were up to me, the implementation of gets() would become:\n\nchar *gets(char *buffer)\n{\n    assert(buffer != 0);\n    abort();\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nGiven that your code will crash anyway, sooner or later, it is better to head the trouble off sooner rather than later.  I&apos;d be prepared to add an error message: \n\nfputs(&quot;obsolete and dangerous function gets() called\\n&quot;, stderr);\n\n\nModern versions of the Linux compilation system generates warnings if you link gets()  and also for some other functions that also have security problems (mktemp(), ).\n\nAlternatives to gets()\n\nfgets()\n\nAs everyone else said, the canonical alternative to gets() is fgets() specifying stdin as the file stream.\n\nchar buffer[BUFSIZ];\n\nwhile (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin) != 0)\n{\n    ...process line of data...\n}\n\n\nWhat no-one else yet mentioned is that gets() does not include the newline but fgets() does.  So, you might need to use a wrapper around fgets() that deletes the newline:\n\nchar *fgets_wrapper(char *buffer, size_t buflen, FILE *fp)\n{\n    if (fgets(buffer, buflen, fp) != 0)\n    {\n        size_t len = strlen(buffer);\n        if (len &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; buffer[len-1] == &apos;\\n&apos;)\n            buffer[len-1] = &apos;\\0&apos;;\n        return buffer;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nOr, better:\n\nchar *fgets_wrapper(char *buffer, size_t buflen, FILE *fp)\n{\n    if (fgets(buffer, buflen, fp) != 0)\n    {\n        buffer[strcspn(buffer, &quot;\\n&quot;)] = &apos;\\0&apos;;\n        return buffer;\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nAlso, as caf points out in a comment and paxdiablo shows in his answer, with fgets() you might have data left over on a line.  My wrapper code leaves that data to be read next time; you can readily modify it to gobble the rest of the line of data if you prefer:\n\n        if (len &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; buffer[len-1] == &apos;\\n&apos;)\n            buffer[len-1] = &apos;\\0&apos;;\n        else\n        {\n             int ch;\n             while ((ch = getc(fp)) != EOF &amp;&amp; ch != &apos;\\n&apos;)\n                 ;\n        }\n\n\nThe residual problem is how to report the three different result states  EOF or error, line read and not truncated, and partial line read but data was truncated.\n\nThis problem doesn&apos;t arise with gets() because it doesn&apos;t know where your buffer ends and merrily tramples beyond the end, wreaking havoc on your beautifully tended memory layout, often messing up the return stack (a Stack Overflow) if the buffer is allocated on the stack, or trampling over the control information if the buffer is dynamically allocated, or copying data over other precious global (or module) variables if the buffer is statically allocated.  None of these is a good idea  they epitomize the phrase &apos;undefined behaviour`.\n\n\n\nThere is also the TR 24731-1 (Technical Report from the C Standard Committee) which provides safer alternatives to a variety of functions, including gets():\n\n\n  §6.5.4.1 The gets_s function\n  \n  Synopsis\n\n#define __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ 1\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\nchar *gets_s(char *s, rsize_t n);\n\n  \n  Runtime-constraints\n  \n  s shall not be a null pointer. n shall neither be equal to zero nor be greater than\n  RSIZE_MAX. A new-line character, end-of-file, or read error shall occur within reading\n  n-1 characters from stdin.25)\n  \n  3 If there is a runtime-constraint violation, s[0] is set to the null character, and characters\n  are read and discarded from stdin until a new-line character is read, or end-of-file or a\n  read error occurs.\n  \n  Description\n  \n  4 The gets_s function reads at most one less than the number of characters specified by n\n  from the stream pointed to by stdin, into the array pointed to by s. No additional\n  characters are read after a new-line character (which is discarded) or after end-of-file.\n  The discarded new-line character does not count towards number of characters read. A\n  null character is written immediately after the last character read into the array.\n  \n  5 If end-of-file is encountered and no characters have been read into the array, or if a read\n  error occurs during the operation, then s[0] is set to the null character, and the other\n  elements of s take unspecified values.\n  \n  Recommended practice\n  \n  6 The fgets function allows properly-written programs to safely process input lines too\n  long to store in the result array. In general this requires that callers of fgets pay\n  attention to the presence or absence of a new-line character in the result array. Consider\n  using fgets (along with any needed processing based on new-line characters) instead of\n  gets_s.\n  \n  25) The gets_s function, unlike gets, makes it a runtime-constraint violation for a line of input to\n  overflow the buffer to store it. Unlike fgets, gets_s maintains a one-to-one relationship between\n  input lines and successful calls to gets_s. Programs that use gets expect such a relationship.\n\n\nThe Microsoft Visual Studio compilers implement an approximation to the TR 24731-1 standard, but there are differences between the signatures implemented by Microsoft and those in the TR.\n\nThe C11 standard, ISO/IEC 9899-2011, includes TR24731 in Annex K as an optional part of the library. Unfortunately, it is seldom implemented on Unix-like systems.\n\n\n\ngetline()  POSIX\n\nPOSIX 2008 also provides a safe alternative to gets() called getline().  It allocates space for the line dynamically, so you end up needing to free it.  It removes the limitation on line length, therefore. It also returns the length of the data that was read, or -1 (and not EOF!), which means that null bytes in the input can be handled reliably.  There is also a &apos;choose your own single-character delimiter&apos; variation called getdelim(); this can be useful if you are dealing with the output from find -print0 where the ends of the file names are marked with an ASCII NUL &apos;\\0&apos; character, for example.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Because gets doesn&apos;t do any kind of check while getting bytes from stdin and putting them somewhere. A simple example:\n\nchar array1[] = &quot;12345&quot;;\nchar array2[] = &quot;67890&quot;;\n\ngets(array1);\n\n\nNow, first of all you are allowed to input how many characters you want, gets won&apos;t care about it. Secondly the bytes over the size of the array in which you put them (in this case array1) will overwrite whatever they find in memory because gets will write them. In the previous example this means that if you input &quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrts&quot; maybe, unpredictably, it will overwrite also array2 or whatever.\n\nThe function is unsafe because it assumes consistent input. NEVER USE IT!\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You should not use gets since it has no way to stop a buffer overflow. If the user types in more data than can fit in your buffer, you will most likely end up with corruption or worse.\n\nIn fact, ISO have actually taken the step of removing gets from the C standard (as of C11, though it was deprecated in C99) which, given how highly they rate backward compatibility, should be an indication of how bad that function was.\n\nThe correct thing to do is to use the fgets function with the stdin file handle since you can limit the characters read from the user.\n\nBut this also has its problems such as:\n\n\nextra characters entered by the user will be picked up the next time around.\nthere&apos;s no quick notification that the user entered too much data.\n\n\nTo that end, almost every C coder at some point in their career will write a more useful wrapper around fgets as well. Here&apos;s mine:\n\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;\n\n#define OK       0\n#define NO_INPUT 1\n#define TOO_LONG 2\nstatic int getLine (char *prmpt, char *buff, size_t sz) {\n    int ch, extra;\n\n    // Get line with buffer overrun protection.\n    if (prmpt != NULL) {\n        printf (&quot;%s&quot;, prmpt);\n        fflush (stdout);\n    }\n    if (fgets (buff, sz, stdin) == NULL)\n        return NO_INPUT;\n\n    // If it was too long, there&apos;ll be no newline. In that case, we flush\n    // to end of line so that excess doesn&apos;t affect the next call.\n    if (buff[strlen(buff)-1] != &apos;\\n&apos;) {\n        extra = 0;\n        while (((ch = getchar()) != &apos;\\n&apos;) &amp;&amp; (ch != EOF))\n            extra = 1;\n        return (extra == 1) ? TOO_LONG : OK;\n    }\n\n    // Otherwise remove newline and give string back to caller.\n    buff[strlen(buff)-1] = &apos;\\0&apos;;\n    return OK;\n}\n\n\nwith some test code:\n\n// Test program for getLine().\n\nint main (void) {\n    int rc;\n    char buff[10];\n\n    rc = getLine (&quot;Enter string&gt; &quot;, buff, sizeof(buff));\n    if (rc == NO_INPUT) {\n        printf (&quot;No input\\n&quot;);\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    if (rc == TOO_LONG) {\n        printf (&quot;Input too long\\n&quot;);\n        return 1;\n    }\n\n    printf (&quot;OK [%s]\\n&quot;, buff);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nIt provides the same protections as fgets in that it prevents buffer overflows but it also notifies the caller as to what happened and clears out the excess characters so that they do not affect your next input operation.\n\nFeel free to use it as you wish, I hereby release it under the &quot;do what you damn well want to&quot; licence :-)\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"fgets.\n\nTo read from the stdin:\n\nchar string[512];\n\nfgets(string, sizeof(string), stdin); /* no buffer overflows here, you&apos;re safe! */\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You can&apos;t remove API functions without breaking the API.

<h1>Why is <code>gets()</code> dangerous</h1>

<p>The first internet worm (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm" rel="noreferrer">Morris Internet Worm</a>) escaped about 30 years ago (1988-11-02), and it used <code>gets()</code> and a buffer overflow as one of its methods of propagating from system to system. The basic problem is that the function doesn't know how big the buffer is, so it continues reading until it finds a newline or encounters EOF, and may overflow the bounds of the buffer it was given.</p>

<p>You should forget you ever heard that <code>gets()</code> existed.</p>

<p>The C11 standard ISO/IEC 9899:2011 eliminated <code>gets()</code> as a standard function, which is A Good Thing (it was formally marked as 'obsolescent' and 'deprecated' in ISO/IEC 9899:1999/Cor.3:2007  Technical Corrigendum 3 for C99, and then removed in C11).  Sadly, it will remain in libraries for many years (meaning 'decades') for reasons of backwards compatibility. If it were up to me, the implementation of <code>gets()</code> would become:</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-type">char</span> *<span class="hljs-title function_">gets</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-type">char</span> *buffer)</span>
{
    assert(buffer != <span class="hljs-number">0</span>);
    <span class="hljs-built_in">abort</span>();
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Given that your code will crash anyway, sooner or later, it is better to head the trouble off sooner rather than later.  I'd be prepared to add an error message: </p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-built_in">fputs</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"obsolete and dangerous function gets() called\n"</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">stderr</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>Modern versions of the Linux compilation system generates warnings if you link <code>gets()</code>  and also for some other functions that also have security problems (<code>mktemp()</code>, ).</p>

<h1>Alternatives to <code>gets()</code></h1>

<h2>fgets()</h2>

<p>As everyone else said, the canonical alternative to <code>gets()</code> is <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fgets.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>fgets()</code></a> specifying <code>stdin</code> as the file stream.</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-type">char</span> buffer[BUFSIZ];

<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> (fgets(buffer, <span class="hljs-keyword">sizeof</span>(buffer), <span class="hljs-built_in">stdin</span>) != <span class="hljs-number">0</span>)
{
    ...process line of data...
}
</code></pre>

<p>What no-one else yet mentioned is that <code>gets()</code> does not include the newline but <code>fgets()</code> does.  So, you might need to use a wrapper around <code>fgets()</code> that deletes the newline:</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-type">char</span> *<span class="hljs-title function_">fgets_wrapper</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-type">char</span> *buffer, <span class="hljs-type">size_t</span> buflen, FILE *fp)</span>
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (fgets(buffer, buflen, fp) != <span class="hljs-number">0</span>)
    {
        <span class="hljs-type">size_t</span> len = <span class="hljs-built_in">strlen</span>(buffer);
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (len &gt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span> &amp;&amp; buffer[len<span class="hljs-number">-1</span>] == <span class="hljs-string">'\n'</span>)
            buffer[len<span class="hljs-number">-1</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">'\0'</span>;
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> buffer;
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or, better:</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-type">char</span> *<span class="hljs-title function_">fgets_wrapper</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-type">char</span> *buffer, <span class="hljs-type">size_t</span> buflen, FILE *fp)</span>
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (fgets(buffer, buflen, fp) != <span class="hljs-number">0</span>)
    {
        buffer[<span class="hljs-built_in">strcspn</span>(buffer, <span class="hljs-string">"\n"</span>)] = <span class="hljs-string">'\0'</span>;
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> buffer;
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/134633/caf">caf</a> points out in a comment and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/14860/paxdiablo">paxdiablo</a> shows in his answer, with <code>fgets()</code> you might have data left over on a line.  My wrapper code leaves that data to be read next time; you can readily modify it to gobble the rest of the line of data if you prefer:</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c">        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (len &gt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span> &amp;&amp; buffer[len<span class="hljs-number">-1</span>] == <span class="hljs-string">'\n'</span>)
            buffer[len<span class="hljs-number">-1</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">'\0'</span>;
        <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>
        {
             <span class="hljs-type">int</span> ch;
             <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> ((ch = getc(fp)) != EOF &amp;&amp; ch != <span class="hljs-string">'\n'</span>)
                 ;
        }
</code></pre>

<p>The residual problem is how to report the three different result states  EOF or error, line read and not truncated, and partial line read but data was truncated.</p>

<p>This problem doesn't arise with <code>gets()</code> because it doesn't know where your buffer ends and merrily tramples beyond the end, wreaking havoc on your beautifully tended memory layout, often messing up the return stack (a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>) if the buffer is allocated on the stack, or trampling over the control information if the buffer is dynamically allocated, or copying data over other precious global (or module) variables if the buffer is statically allocated.  None of these is a good idea  they epitomize the phrase 'undefined behaviour`.</p>

<p>There is also the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/372980/do-you-use-the-tr-24731-safe-functions-in-your-c-code">TR 24731-1</a> (Technical Report from the C Standard Committee) which provides safer alternatives to a variety of functions, including <code>gets()</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>§6.5.4.1 The <code>gets_s</code> function</h2>
  
  <h3>Synopsis</h3>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-keyword">define</span> __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ 1</span>

</code></pre>
  
  <h3>Runtime-constraints</h3>
  
  <p><code>s</code> shall not be a null pointer. <code>n</code> shall neither be equal to zero nor be greater than
  RSIZE_MAX. A new-line character, end-of-file, or read error shall occur within reading
  <code>n-1</code> characters from <code>stdin</code>.<sup>25)</sup></p>
  
  <p>3 If there is a runtime-constraint violation, <code>s[0]</code> is set to the null character, and characters
  are read and discarded from <code>stdin</code> until a new-line character is read, or end-of-file or a
  read error occurs.</p>
  
  <h3>Description</h3>
  
  <p>4 The <code>gets_s</code> function reads at most one less than the number of characters specified by <code>n</code>
  from the stream pointed to by <code>stdin</code>, into the array pointed to by <code>s</code>. No additional
  characters are read after a new-line character (which is discarded) or after end-of-file.
  The discarded new-line character does not count towards number of characters read. A
  null character is written immediately after the last character read into the array.</p>
  
  <p>5 If end-of-file is encountered and no characters have been read into the array, or if a read
  error occurs during the operation, then <code>s[0]</code> is set to the null character, and the other
  elements of <code>s</code> take unspecified values.</p>
  
  <h3>Recommended practice</h3>
  
  <p>6 The <code>fgets</code> function allows properly-written programs to safely process input lines too
  long to store in the result array. In general this requires that callers of <code>fgets</code> pay
  attention to the presence or absence of a new-line character in the result array. Consider
  using <code>fgets</code> (along with any needed processing based on new-line characters) instead of
  <code>gets_s</code>.</p>
  
  <p><sup>25)</sup> The <code>gets_s</code> function, unlike <code>gets</code>, makes it a runtime-constraint violation for a line of input to
  overflow the buffer to store it. Unlike <code>fgets</code>, <code>gets_s</code> maintains a one-to-one relationship between
  input lines and successful calls to <code>gets_s</code>. Programs that use <code>gets</code> expect such a relationship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Microsoft Visual Studio compilers implement an approximation to the TR 24731-1 standard, but there are differences between the signatures implemented by Microsoft and those in the TR.</p>

<p>The C11 standard, ISO/IEC 9899-2011, includes TR24731 in Annex K as an optional part of the library. Unfortunately, it is seldom implemented on Unix-like systems.</p>

<h2><code>getline()</code>  POSIX</h2>

<p>POSIX 2008 also provides a safe alternative to <code>gets()</code> called <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/getline.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>getline()</code></a>.  It allocates space for the line dynamically, so you end up needing to free it.  It removes the limitation on line length, therefore. It also returns the length of the data that was read, or <code>-1</code> (and not <code>EOF</code>!), which means that null bytes in the input can be handled reliably.  There is also a 'choose your own single-character delimiter' variation called <code>getdelim()</code>; this can be useful if you are dealing with the output from <code>find -print0</code> where the ends of the file names are marked with an ASCII NUL <code>'\0'</code> character, for example.</p>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution3" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl solution-inner border md:px-10 md:py-10 px-2 py-10 shadow-md bg-white"><div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-between"><h4 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 3</h4><div class="tags-wrap h-max space-x-8"><div class="tags"><a class="rounded-2xl border bg-neutral-100 px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold whitespace-nowrap" href="/questions/tag/fgets">fgets</a><a class="rounded-2xl border bg-neutral-100 px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold whitespace-nowrap" href="/questions/tag/buffer-overflow">buffer-overflow</a><a class="rounded-2xl border bg-neutral-100 px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold whitespace-nowrap" href="/questions/tag/gets">gets</a></div></div></div><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>Because <code>gets</code> doesn't do any kind of check while getting bytes from <em>stdin</em> and putting them somewhere. A simple example:</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-type">char</span> array1[] = <span class="hljs-string">"12345"</span>;
<span class="hljs-type">char</span> array2[] = <span class="hljs-string">"67890"</span>;

gets(array1);
</code></pre>

<p>Now, first of all you are allowed to input how many characters you want, <code>gets</code> won't care about it. Secondly the bytes over the size of the array in which you put them (in this case <code>array1</code>) will overwrite whatever they find in memory because <code>gets</code> will write them. In the previous example this means that if you input <code>"abcdefghijklmnopqrts"</code> maybe, unpredictably, it will overwrite also <code>array2</code> or whatever.</p>

<p>The function is unsafe because it assumes consistent input. <strong>NEVER USE IT!</strong></p>

<p>You should not use <code>gets</code> since it has no way to stop a buffer overflow. If the user types in more data than can fit in your buffer, you will most likely end up with corruption or worse.</p>

<p>In fact, ISO have actually taken the step of <em>removing</em> <code>gets</code> from the C standard (as of C11, though it was deprecated in C99) which, given how highly they rate backward compatibility, should be an indication of how bad that function was.</p>

<p>The correct thing to do is to use the <code>fgets</code> function with the <code>stdin</code> file handle since you can limit the characters read from the user.</p>

<p>But this also has its problems such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>extra characters entered by the user will be picked up the next time around.</li>
<li>there's no quick notification that the user entered too much data.</li>
</ul>

<p>To that end, almost every C coder at some point in their career will write a more useful wrapper around <code>fgets</code> as well. Here's mine:</p>

    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> OK;

</code></pre>

<p>with some test code:</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-comment">// Test program for getLine().</span>

    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It provides the same protections as <code>fgets</code> in that it prevents buffer overflows but it also notifies the caller as to what happened and clears out the excess characters so that they do not affect your next input operation.</p>

<p><code>gets()</code> is dangerous because it is possible for the user to crash the program by typing too much into the prompt. It can't detect the end of available memory, so if you allocate an amount of memory too small for the purpose, it can cause a seg fault and crash. Sometimes it seems very unlikely that a user will type 1000 letters into a prompt meant for a person's name, but as programmers, we need to make our programs bulletproof. (it may also be a security risk if a user can crash a system program by sending too much data).</p>

<p><code>fgets()</code> allows you to specify how many characters are taken out of the standard input buffer, so they don't overrun the variable.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>The <code>gets()</code> function does not perform bounds checking, therefore this function is extremely vulnerable to buffer-overflow attacks. It cannot be used safely (unless the program runs in an environment which restricts what can appear on <code>stdin</code>). For this reason, the function has been deprecated in the third corrigendum to the C99 standard and removed altogether in the C11 standard. <code>fgets()</code> and <code>gets_s()</code> are the recommended replacements.</p>
