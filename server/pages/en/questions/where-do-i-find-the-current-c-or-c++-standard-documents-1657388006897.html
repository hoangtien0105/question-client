For many questions the answer seems to be found in &quot;the standard&quot;. However, where do we find that? Preferably online.

Googling can sometimes feel futile, again especially for the C standards, since they are drowned in the flood of discussions on programming forums.

To get this started, since these are the ones I am searching for right now, where are there good online resources for:

Note that the conversion between ANSI and ISO/IEC Standard is seen inside this document, the document refers to its name as &quot;ANSI/ISO: 9899/99&quot; although this isn&apos;t the right name of the later made standard of it, the right name is &quot;ISO/IEC 9899:1990&quot;)\n\nTC1 for C90: http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n423.pdf\n\nThere isn&apos;t a PDF link for TC2 on the WG14 website, sadly.\n\nISO/IEC 9899:1999 (C99 incorporating all three Technical Corrigenda):\nhttp://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf\n\nAn earlier version of C99 incorporating only TC1 and TC2:\nhttp://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1124.pdf\n\nWorking draft for the original (i.e. pre-corrigenda) C99: http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n843.htm (HTML) and http://www.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n843.pdf (PDF).\nNote that there were two later working drafts: N869 and N878, but they seem to have been removed from the WG14 website, so this is the latest one available.\n\nList of changes between C89/C90 and C99: http://port70.net/~nsz/c/c89/c9x_changes.html\n\nTC1 for C99 (only the TC, not the standard incorporating it): http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/9899tc1/n32071.PDF\n\nTC2 for C99 (only the TC, not the standard incorporating it): http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/9899-1999_cor_2-2004.pdf\n\nISO/IEC 9899:2011 (C11):\nhttp://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf\nFor information on the differences between N1570 and the final, published version of C11, see Latest changes in C11 and https://groups.google.com/g/comp.std.c/c/v5hsWOu5vSw\n\nISO/IEC 9899:2011/Cor 1:2012 (C11&apos;s only technical corrigendum): This can be viewed at https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:9899:ed-3:v1:cor:1:v1:en but cannot be downloaded.

The FCD (Final Committee Draft) versions are password protected; you need to be on the standards committee to get them.\nEven though the draft versions might be very close to the final ratified versions of the standards, some of this post&apos;s editors would strongly advise you to get a copy of the actual documents  especially if you&apos;re planning on quoting them as references. Of course, starving students should go ahead and use the drafts if strapped for cash.\n\nIt appears that, if you are willing and able to wait a few months after ratification of a standard, to search for &quot;INCITS/ISO/IEC&quot; instead of &quot;ISO/IEC&quot; when looking for a standard is the key. By doing so, one of this post&apos;s editors was able to find the C11 and C++11 standards at reasonable prices. For example, if you search for &quot;INCITS/ISO/IEC 9899:2011&quot; instead of &quot;ISO/IEC 9899:2011&quot; on webstore.ansi.org you will find the reasonably priced PDF version.\n\nThe site https://wg21.link/ provides short-URL links to the C++ current working draft and draft standards, and committee papers:\n\nhttps://wg21.link/std11 - C++11\nhttps://wg21.link/std14 - C++14\nhttps://wg21.link/std17 - C++17\nhttps://wg21.link/std20 - C++20\nhttps://wg21.link/std - current working draft (as of May 2022 still points to the 2021 version)\n\n\nThe current draft of the standard is maintained as LaTeX sources on Github. These sources can be converted to HTML using cxxdraft-htmlgen. The following sites maintain HTML pages so generated:\n\nTim Song - Current working draft - C++11 - C++14 - C++17 - C++20\nEelis - Current working draft\n\nTim Song also maintains generated HTML and PDF versions of the Networking TS and Ranges TS.\nPOSIX extensions to the C standard\nThe POSIX standard (IEEE 1003.1) requires a compliant operating system to include a C compiler. This compiler must in turn be compliant with the C standard, and must also support various extensions defined in the &quot;System Interfaces&quot; section of POSIX (such as the off_t data type, the &lt;aio.h&gt; header, the clock_gettime() function and the _POSIX_C_SOURCE macro.)\nSo if you&apos;ve tried to look up a particular function, been informed &quot;This function is part of POSIX, not the C standard&quot;, and wondered why an operating system standard was mandating compiler features and language extensions... now you know!\n\nPOSIX.1-2001: The System Interfaces section can be downloaded as a separate document from https://mirror.math.princeton.edu/pub/oldlinux/download/c951.pdf. Section 1.7 states that the relevant version of the C standard is C99.\nThe &quot;Shell and Utilities&quot; section (https://mirror.math.princeton.edu/pub/oldlinux/download/c952.pdf) mandates not only that a C99-compliant compiler should exist, but that it should be invokable from the command line under the name &quot;c99&quot;. One way in which this can be implemented is to place a shell script called &quot;c99&quot; in /usr/bin, which calls gcc with the -std=c99 option added to the list of command-line parameters, and blocks any competing standards from being specified.\nPOSIX.1-2001 had two technical corrigenda, one dated 2002 and one dated 2004. I don&apos;t think they&apos;re incorporated into the documents as linked above. There&apos;s an online HTML version incorporating the corrigenda at https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/ - but I should add that I&apos;ve had some trouble with the search box and so using Google to search the site is probably your best bet.\nThere is a paywalled link to download the first corrigendum at https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1003_1-2001-Cor1-2002.html.\nThere is also a paywalled link for the second at https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1003_1-2001-Cor2-2004.html\n\n\n\nThere is a draft version of POSIX.1-2008 at http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/open/n4217.pdf.\nPOSIX.1-2008 also had two technical corrigenda, the latter of the two being dated 2016. There is an online HTML version of the standard incorporating the corrigenda at https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799.2016edition/ - though, again, I have had situations where the site&apos;s own search box wasn&apos;t good for finding information.\n\nThere is an online HTML version of POSIX.1-2017 at https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/ - though, again, I recommend using Google instead of that site&apos;s searchbox. According to the Open Group website &quot;IEEE 1003.1-2017 ... is a revision to the 1003.1-2008 standard to rollup the standard including its two technical corrigenda (as-is)&quot;. Linux manpages describe it as &quot;technically identical&quot; to POSIX.1-2008 with Technical Corrigenda 1 and 2 applied.

It was integrated into C99, although some compilers such as Clang allow you to specifiy -std=c94 on the command line.

This work has culminated in Normative Addendum 1.\n  \n  Normative Addendum 1 embodies C&apos;s reaction to both the limitations and\n  promises of international character sets.  Digraphs and the \n  header were meant to improve the appearance of C programs written in\n  national variants of ISO 646 without, e.g., { or } characters.  On the\n  other end of the spectrum, the facilities connected to  and\n   extend the old Standard&apos;s barely adequate basis into a\n  complete and consistent set of utilities for handling wide characters\n  and multibyte strings.\n  \n  This document summarizes Normative Addendum 1.  It is intended to\n  quickly inform readers who are already familiar with the Standard; it\n  does not, and cannot, introduce the complex subject matter behind NA1,\n  nor can it replace the original document as a reference manual. \n  (Nevertheless, it tries to be as accurate as possible, and its author\n  would like to hear about any errors or omissions.)\n\n\n\nhttp://www.lysator.liu.se/c/na1.html\n\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/where-do-i-find-the-current-c-or-c++-standard-documents-1657388006897#solution11","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0}],"@type":"Question"}}</script><meta name="next-head-count" content="22"/><script id="google-analytics" data-nscript="beforeInteractive">(function(w,d,s,l,i){w[l]=w[l]||[];w[l].push({'gtm.start':

<p>For many questions the answer seems to be found in "the standard". However, where do we find that? Preferably online.</p>

<p>Googling can sometimes feel futile, again especially for the C standards, since they are drowned in the flood of discussions on programming forums.</p>

<p>To get this started, since these are the ones I am searching for right now, where are there good online resources for:</p>

<ul>
<li>C89</li>
<li>C99</li>
<li>C11</li>
<li>C++98</li>
<li>C++03</li>
<li>C++11</li>
<li>C++14</li>

<h3>Non-PDF electronic versions of the standard</h3>
<p><em><strong>Warning: most copies of standard drafts are published in PDF format, and errors may have been introduced if the text/HTML was transcribed or automatically generated from the PDF.</strong></em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>(The site hosting the plain text version of the C++11 working draft also has some C++14 drafts in this format. But none of them are copies of the final working draft, N4140.)</em></p>
<h3>Print versions of the standard</h3>
<p>Print copies of the standards are available from national standards bodies and <a href="https://www.iso.org/home.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ISO</a> but are very expensive.</p>
<p>If you want a hardcopy of the C90 standard for much less money than above, you may be able to find a cheap used copy of <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/bullschildt.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Herb Schildt</a>'s book <a href="http://www.davros.org/c/schildt.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><em>The Annotated ANSI Standard</em></a> at <a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0078819520" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Amazon</a>, which contains the actual text of the standard (useful) and commentary on the standard (less useful - it contains several dangerous and misleading errors).</p>
<p>The C99 and C++03 standards are available in book form from Wiley and the BSI (British Standards Institute):</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>Standards committee draft versions (free)</h3>
<p>The working drafts for future standards are often available from the committee websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">C++ committee website</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">C committee website</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to get drafts from the current or earlier C/C++ standards, there are some available for free on the internet:</p>
<h3>For C:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>ANSI X3.159-198 (C89):
I cannot find a PDF of C89, but it is almost the same as C90. The only major differences are in the boilerplate and section numbering, although there are some slight textual differences</p>
</li>
<li><p>ISO/IEC 9899:1990 (C90):
(Almost the same as ANSI X3.159-198 (C89) except for the frontmatter and section numbering. There is at least one textual difference in section 6.5.7 (previously 3.5.7), where <em>"a list"</em> became <em>"a brace-enclosed list"</em>. Note that the conversion between ANSI and ISO/IEC Standard is seen inside this document, the document refers to its name as "ANSI/ISO: 9899/99" although this isn't the right name of the later made standard of it, the right name is "ISO/IEC 9899:1990")</p>
</li>

</li>
<li><p>ISO/IEC 9899:1999 (C99 incorporating all three Technical Corrigenda):

</li>
<li><p>Working draft for the original (i.e. pre-corrigenda) C99: <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n843.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n843.htm</a> (HTML) and <a href="http://www.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n843.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n843.pdf</a> (PDF).
Note that there were two later working drafts: N869 and N878, but they seem to have been removed from the WG14 website, so this is the latest one available.</p>

<p>Note that these documents are not the same as the standard, though the versions just prior to the meetings that decide on a standard are usually very close to what is in the final standard. The FCD (Final Committee Draft) versions are password protected; you need to be on the standards committee to get them.</p>
<p>Even though the draft versions might be very close to the final ratified versions of the standards, some of this post's editors would strongly advise you to get a copy of the actual documents  especially if you're planning on quoting them as references. Of course, starving students should go ahead and use the drafts if strapped for cash.</p>
<hr>
<p>It appears that, if you are willing and able to wait a few months after ratification of a standard, to search for "INCITS/ISO/IEC" instead of "ISO/IEC" when looking for a standard is the key. By doing so, one of this post's editors was able to find the C11 and C++11 standards at reasonable prices. For example, if you search for "INCITS/ISO/IEC 9899:2011" instead of "ISO/IEC 9899:2011" on <a href="https://webstore.ansi.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">webstore.ansi.org</a> you will find the reasonably priced PDF version.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX" rel="nofollow noreferrer">POSIX</a> standard (IEEE 1003.1) requires a compliant operating system to include a C compiler. This compiler must in turn be compliant with the C standard, and must also support various extensions defined in the "System Interfaces" section of POSIX (such as the <code>off_t</code> data type, the <code>&lt;aio.h&gt;</code> header, the <code>clock_gettime()</code> function and the <code>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</code> macro.)</p>
<p>So if you've tried to look up a particular function, been informed "This function is part of POSIX, not the C standard", and wondered why an operating system standard was mandating compiler features and language extensions... now you know!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>POSIX.1-2001: The System Interfaces section can be downloaded as a separate document from <a href="https://mirror.math.princeton.edu/pub/oldlinux/download/c951.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://mirror.math.princeton.edu/pub/oldlinux/download/c951.pdf</a>. Section 1.7 states that the relevant version of the C standard is C99.</p>
<p>The "Shell and Utilities" section (<a href="https://mirror.math.princeton.edu/pub/oldlinux/download/c952.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://mirror.math.princeton.edu/pub/oldlinux/download/c952.pdf</a>) mandates not only that a C99-compliant compiler should exist, but that it should be invokable from the command line under the name "c99". One way in which this can be implemented is to place a shell script called "c99" in /usr/bin, which calls gcc with the <code>-std=c99</code> option added to the list of command-line parameters, and blocks any competing standards from being specified.</p>
<p>POSIX.1-2001 had two technical corrigenda, one dated 2002 and one dated 2004. I don't think they're incorporated into the documents as linked above. There's an online HTML version incorporating the corrigenda at <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/</a> - but I should add that I've had some trouble with the search box and so using Google to search the site is probably your best bet.</p>
<p>There is a paywalled link to download the first corrigendum at <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1003_1-2001-Cor1-2002.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1003_1-2001-Cor1-2002.html</a>.</p>
<p>There is also a paywalled link for the second at <a href="https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1003_1-2001-Cor2-2004.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1003_1-2001-Cor2-2004.html</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>There is a draft version of POSIX.1-2008 at <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/open/n4217.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/open/n4217.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>POSIX.1-2008 also had two technical corrigenda, the latter of the two being dated 2016. There is an online HTML version of the standard incorporating the corrigenda at <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799.2016edition/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799.2016edition/</a> - though, again, I have had situations where the site's own search box wasn't good for finding information.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is an online HTML version of POSIX.1-2017 at <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/</a> - though, again, I recommend using Google instead of that site's searchbox. According to the <a href="https://www.opengroup.org/austin/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Open Group website</a> "IEEE 1003.1-2017 ... is a revision to the 1003.1-2008 standard to rollup the standard including its two technical corrigenda (as-is)". <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/standards.7.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Linux manpages</a> describe it as "technically identical" to POSIX.1-2008 with Technical Corrigenda 1 and 2 applied. This is therefore not a major revision and does not change the value of the <code>_POSIX_C_SOURCE</code> macro.</p>

<p>ISO standards cost money, from a moderate amount (for a PDF version), to a bit more (for a book version).</p>

<p>While they aren't finalised however, they can usually be found online, as drafts. Most of the times the final version doesn't differ significantly from the last draft, so while not perfect, they'll suit just fine.</p>

<p>The actual standards documents may not be the most useful.  Most compilers do not fully implement the standards and may sometimes actually conflict.

<p>Although not an actual standard, there is an amendment to ISO C (C89/90) called C94/95, or Normative Addendum 1. It was integrated into C99, although some compilers such as <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html" rel="nofollow">Clang</a> allow you to specifiy <code>-std=c94</code> on the command line.

<p>A summary of the document can be found <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/na1.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the (then draft) ANSI C Standard was being considered for
  adoption of an International Standard in 1990, there were several
  objections because it didn't address internationalization issues. 
  Because the Standard had already been several years in the making, it
  was agreed that a few changes would be made to provide the basis (for
  example, the functions in subclause 7.10.7 were added), and work would
  be carried out separately to provide proper internationalization of
  the Standard.  This work has culminated in Normative Addendum 1.</p>
  
  <p>Normative Addendum 1 embodies C's reaction to both the limitations and
  promises of international character sets.  Digraphs and the 
  header were meant to improve the appearance of C programs written in
  national variants of ISO 646 without, e.g., { or } characters.  On the
  other end of the spectrum, the facilities connected to  and
   extend the old Standard's barely adequate basis into a
  complete and consistent set of utilities for handling wide characters
  and multibyte strings.</p>
  
  <p>This document summarizes Normative Addendum 1.  It is intended to
  quickly inform readers who are already familiar with the Standard; it
  does not, and cannot, introduce the complex subject matter behind NA1,
  nor can it replace the original document as a reference manual. 
  (Nevertheless, it tries to be as accurate as possible, and its author
  would like to hear about any errors or omissions.)</p>

This work has culminated in Normative Addendum 1.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n  \n  \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Normative Addendum 1 embodies C\u0026apos;s reaction to both the limitations and\n  promises of international character sets.  Digraphs and the \n  header were meant to improve the appearance of C programs written in\n  national variants of ISO 646 without, e.g., { or } characters.  On the\n  other end of the spectrum, the facilities connected to  and\n   extend the old Standard\u0026apos;s barely adequate basis into a\n  complete and consistent set of utilities for handling wide characters\n  and multibyte strings.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n  \n  \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This document summarizes Normative Addendum 1.
