How do I do that?\n    ","answerCount":30,"upVoteCount":500,"suggestedAnswer":[{"text":"Are you doing this for logging purposes?  If so there are several libraries for this. Two of the most popular are Log4j and Logback.\nJava 7+\nFor a one-time task, the Files class makes this easy:\ntry {\n    Files.write(Paths.get(&quot;myfile.txt&quot;), &quot;the text&quot;.getBytes(), StandardOpenOption.APPEND);\n}catch (IOException e) {\n    //exception handling left as an exercise for the reader\n}\n\nCareful: The above approach will throw a NoSuchFileException if the file does not already exist. It also does not append a newline automatically (which you often want when appending to a text file). Another approach is to pass both CREATE and APPEND options, which will create the file first if it doesn&apos;t already exist:\nprivate void write(final String s) throws IOException {\n    Files.writeString(\n        Path.of(System.getProperty(&quot;java.io.tmpdir&quot;), &quot;filename.txt&quot;),\n        s + System.lineSeparator(),\n        CREATE, APPEND\n    );\n}\n\nHowever, if you will be writing to the same file many times, the above snippets must open and close the file on the disk many times, which is a slow operation. In this case, a BufferedWriter is faster:\ntry(FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(&quot;myfile.txt&quot;, true);\n    BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw);\n    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(bw))\n{\n    out.println(&quot;the text&quot;);\n    //more code\n    out.println(&quot;more text&quot;);\n    //more code\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    //exception handling left as an exercise for the reader\n}\n\nNotes:\n\nThe second parameter to the FileWriter constructor will tell it to append to the file, rather than writing a new file. (If the file does not exist, it will be created.)\nUsing a BufferedWriter is recommended for an expensive writer (such as FileWriter).\nUsing a PrintWriter gives you access to println syntax that you&apos;re probably used to from System.out.\nBut the BufferedWriter and PrintWriter wrappers are not strictly necessary.\n\n\nOlder Java\ntry {\n    PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(&quot;myfile.txt&quot;, true)));\n    out.println(&quot;the text&quot;);\n    out.close();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    //exception handling left as an exercise for the reader\n}\n\n\nException Handling\nIf you need robust exception handling for older Java, it gets very verbose:\nFileWriter fw = null;\nBufferedWriter bw = null;\nPrintWriter out = null;\ntry {\n    fw = new FileWriter(&quot;myfile.txt&quot;, true);\n    bw = new BufferedWriter(fw);\n    out = new PrintWriter(bw);\n    out.println(&quot;the text&quot;);\n    out.close();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    //exception handling left as an exercise for the reader\n}\nfinally {\n    try {\n        if(out != null)\n            out.close();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        //exception handling left as an exercise for the reader\n    }\n    try {\n        if(bw != null)\n            bw.close();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        //exception handling left as an exercise for the reader\n    }\n    try {\n        if(fw != null)\n            fw.close();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        //exception handling left as an exercise for the reader\n    }\n}\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You can use fileWriter with a flag set to true , for appending.\n\ntry\n{\n    String filename= &quot;MyFile.txt&quot;;\n    FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(filename,true); //the true will append the new data\n    fw.write(&quot;add a line\\n&quot;);//appends the string to the file\n    fw.close();\n}\ncatch(IOException ioe)\n{\n    System.err.println(&quot;IOException: &quot; + ioe.getMessage());\n}\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Shouldn&apos;t all of the answers here with try/catch blocks have the .close() pieces contained in a finally block?\n\nExample for marked answer:\n\nPrintWriter out = null;\ntry {\n    out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(&quot;writePath&quot;, true)));\n    out.println(&quot;the text&quot;);\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    System.err.println(e);\n} finally {\n    if (out != null) {\n        out.close();\n    }\n} \n\n\nAlso, as of Java 7, you can use a try-with-resources statement. No finally block is required for closing the declared resource(s) because it is handled automatically, and is also less verbose:\n\ntry(PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(&quot;writePath&quot;, true)))) {\n    out.println(&quot;the text&quot;);\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    System.err.println(e);\n}\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Using Apache Commons 2.1:\nFileUtils.writeStringToFile(file, &quot;String to append&quot;, true);\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Slightly expanding on Kip&apos;s answer,\nhere is a simple Java 7+ method to append a new line to a file, creating it if it doesn&apos;t already exist:\ntry {\n    final Path path = Paths.get(&quot;path/to/filename.txt&quot;);\n    Files.write(path, Arrays.asList(&quot;New line to append&quot;), StandardCharsets.UTF_8,\n        Files.exists(path) ? StandardOpenOption.APPEND : StandardOpenOption.CREATE);\n} catch (final IOException ioe) {\n    // Add your own exception handling...\n}\n\nFurther notes:\n\nThe above uses the Files.write overload that writes lines of text to a file (i.e. similar to a println command). To just write text to the end (i.e. similar to a print command), an alternative Files.write overload can be used, passing in a byte array (e.g. &quot;mytext&quot;.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8)).\n\nThe CREATE option will only work if the specified directory already exists - if it doesn&apos;t, a NoSuchFileException is thrown. If required, the following code could be added after setting path to create the directory structure:\nPath pathParent = path.getParent();\nif (!Files.exists(pathParent)) {\n    Files.createDirectories(pathParent);\n}\n\n\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Make sure the stream gets properly closed in all scenarios.\n\nIt&apos;s a bit alarming how many of these answers leave the file handle open in case of an error. The answer https://stackoverflow.com/a/15053443/2498188 is on the money but only because BufferedWriter() cannot throw. If it could then an exception would leave the FileWriter object open. \n\nA more general way of doing this that doesn&apos;t care if BufferedWriter() can throw:\n\n  PrintWriter out = null;\n  BufferedWriter bw = null;\n  FileWriter fw = null;\n  try{\n     fw = new FileWriter(&quot;outfilename&quot;, true);\n     bw = new BufferedWriter(fw);\n     out = new PrintWriter(bw);\n     out.println(&quot;the text&quot;);\n  }\n  catch( IOException e ){\n     // File writing/opening failed at some stage.\n  }\n  finally{\n     try{\n        if( out != null ){\n           out.close(); // Will close bw and fw too\n        }\n        else if( bw != null ){\n           bw.close(); // Will close fw too\n        }\n        else if( fw != null ){\n           fw.close();\n        }\n        else{\n           // Oh boy did it fail hard! :3\n        }\n     }\n     catch( IOException e ){\n        // Closing the file writers failed for some obscure reason\n     }\n  }\n\n\nEdit:\n\nAs of Java 7, the recommended way is to use &quot;try with resources&quot; and let the JVM deal with it:\n\n  try(    FileWriter fw = new FileWriter(&quot;outfilename&quot;, true);\n          BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(fw);\n          PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(bw)){\n     out.println(&quot;the text&quot;);\n  }  \n  catch( IOException e ){\n      // File writing/opening failed at some stage.\n  }\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution6","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"In Java-7 it also can be done such kind:\n\nimport java.nio.file.Files;\nimport java.nio.file.Path;\nimport java.nio.file.Paths;\nimport java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption;\n\n\n//---------------------\n\nPath filePath = Paths.get(&quot;someFile.txt&quot;);\nif (!Files.exists(filePath)) {\n    Files.createFile(filePath);\n}\nFiles.write(filePath, &quot;Text to be added&quot;.getBytes(), StandardOpenOption.APPEND);\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution7","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"java 7+\n\nIn my humble opinion since I am fan of plain java, I would suggest something that it is a combination of the aforementioned answers.

<p>Are you doing this for logging purposes?  If so there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_logging_framework" rel="noreferrer">several libraries for this</a>. Two of the most popular are <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/" rel="noreferrer">Log4j</a> and <a href="http://logback.qos.ch/" rel="noreferrer">Logback</a>.</p>
<h2>Java 7+</h2>
<p>For a one-time task, the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html" rel="noreferrer">Files class</a> makes this easy:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">try</span> {
    Files.write(Paths.get(<span class="hljs-string">"myfile.txt"</span>), <span class="hljs-string">"the text"</span>.getBytes(), StandardOpenOption.APPEND);
}<span class="hljs-keyword">catch</span> (IOException e) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">//exception handling left as an exercise for the reader</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Careful</strong>: The above approach will throw a <code>NoSuchFileException</code> if the file does not already exist. It also does not append a newline automatically (which you often want when appending to a text file). Another approach is to pass both <code>CREATE</code> and <code>APPEND</code> options, which will create the file first if it doesn't already exist:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">write</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">final</span> String s)</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">throws</span> IOException {
    Files.writeString(
        Path.of(System.getProperty(<span class="hljs-string">"java.io.tmpdir"</span>), <span class="hljs-string">"filename.txt"</span>),
        s + System.lineSeparator(),
        CREATE, APPEND
    );
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, if you will be writing to the same file many times, the above snippets must open and close the file on the disk many times, which is a slow operation. In this case, a <code>BufferedWriter</code> is faster:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">try</span>(<span class="hljs-type">FileWriter</span> <span class="hljs-variable">fw</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">FileWriter</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"myfile.txt"</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>);
    <span class="hljs-type">BufferedWriter</span> <span class="hljs-variable">bw</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">BufferedWriter</span>(fw);
    <span class="hljs-type">PrintWriter</span> <span class="hljs-variable">out</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">PrintWriter</span>(bw))
{
    out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"the text"</span>);
    <span class="hljs-comment">//more code</span>
    out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"more text"</span>);
    <span class="hljs-comment">//more code</span>
} <span class="hljs-keyword">catch</span> (IOException e) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">//exception handling left as an exercise for the reader</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<li>The second parameter to the <code>FileWriter</code> constructor will tell it to append to the file, rather than writing a new file. (If the file does not exist, it will be created.)</li>
<li>Using a <code>BufferedWriter</code> is recommended for an expensive writer (such as <code>FileWriter</code>).</li>
<li>Using a <code>PrintWriter</code> gives you access to <code>println</code> syntax that you're probably used to from <code>System.out</code>.</li>

<p>In my humble opinion since I am fan of plain java, I would suggest something that it is a combination of the aforementioned answers. Maybe I am late for the party. Here is the code:</p>

 StandardOpenOption.CREATE, StandardOpenOption.APPEND);

<p>If the file doesn't exist, it creates it and if already exists it appends the 
<em>sampleText</em> to the existing file. Using this, saves you from adding unnecessary libs to your classpath.</p>

<p>This creates a <code>BufferedWriter</code> using Files, which accepts <code>StandardOpenOption</code> parameters, and an auto-flushing <code>PrintWriter</code> from the resultant <code>BufferedWriter</code>. <code>PrintWriter</code>'s <code>println()</code> method, can then be called to write to the file.</p>

<p>There are few points to note:</p>

<ol>
<li>It is always a good habit to specify charset encoding and for that we have constant in class <code>StandardCharsets</code>.</li>
<li>The code uses <code>try-with-resource</code> statement in which resources are automatically closed after the try.</li>
</ol>
