It turns out that the most verbose method, the for loop has the highest performance. Use the for loop for really CPU intensive copying (large/many arrays). \n\nAfter that the .slice() method also has decent performance and is also less verbose and easier for the programmer to implement. I suggest to use .slice() for your everyday copying of arrays which aren&apos;t very CPU intensive. Also avoid using the JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(arr)) (lots of overhead) if no deep clone is required and performance is an issue.\n\nSource performance test\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution24","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"\nvar arr2 = arr1.slice(0);\n\nThis way just work for simple Arrays.\nIf you have Complex Array like array of Objects then you must use another solutions like:\nconst arr2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(arr1)); \n\nFor example, we have an array of objects that each cell have another array field in its object ... in this situation if we use slice method then the array fields will copy by Ref and that&apos;s mean these fields updates will affect on orginal array same element and fields.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution25","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Using jQuery deep copy could be made as following:\n\nvar arr2 = $.extend(true, [], arr1);\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution26","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You can also use ES6 spread operator to copy Array\n\nvar arr=[2,3,4,5];\nvar copyArr=[...arr];\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution27","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Here are few more way to copy:\n\n\n\nconst array = [1,2,3,4];\n\nconst arrayCopy1 = Object.values(array);\nconst arrayCopy2 = Object.assign([], array);\nconst arrayCopy3 = array.map(i =&gt; i);\nconst arrayCopy4 = Array.of(...array );\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution28","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"For ES6 array containing objects\n\ncloneArray(arr) {\n    return arr.map(x =&gt; ({ ...x }));\n}\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution29","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Quick Examples:\n\n\nIf elements in the array are primitive types (string, number, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nvar arr1 = [&apos;a&apos;,&apos;b&apos;,&apos;c&apos;];\n// arr1 and arr2 are independent and primitive elements are stored in \n// different places in the memory\nvar arr2 = arr1.slice(); \narr2.push(&apos;d&apos;);\nconsole.log(arr1); // [ &apos;a&apos;, &apos;b&apos;, &apos;c&apos; ]\nconsole.log(arr2); // [ &apos;a&apos;, &apos;b&apos;, &apos;c&apos;, &apos;d&apos; ]\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\n\nIf elements in the array are object literals, another array ({}, [])\n\n\n\n\nvar arr1 = [{ x: &apos;a&apos;, y: &apos;b&apos;}, [1, 2], [3, 4]];\n// arr1 and arr2 are independent and reference&apos;s/addresses are stored in different\n// places in the memory.

<p>Basically, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice" rel="noreferrer"><code>slice()</code></a> operation clones the array and returns a reference to a new array.</p>
<h3>Also note that:</h3>
<p>For references, strings and numbers (and not the actual object), <strong><code>slice()</code> copies object references into the new array.</strong> Both the original and new array refer to the same object. If a referenced object changes, the changes are visible to both the new and original arrays.</p>
<p>Primitives such as strings and numbers are immutable, so changes to the string or number are impossible.</p>

<p>In Javascript, deep-copy techniques depend on the elements in an array. Let's start there.</p>
<h2>Three types of elements</h2>
<p>Elements can be: literal values, literal structures, or prototypes.</p>

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> booleanLiteral = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>;

<span class="hljs-comment">// Literal structures (type2)</span>

<p>From these elements we can create three types of arrays.</p>

<h2>Deep copy techniques depend on the three array types</h2>
<p>Based on the types of elements in the array, we can use various techniques to deep copy.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Array of literal-values (type1)</strong><br>
The <code>[ ...myArray ]</code>, <code>myArray.splice(0)</code>, <code>myArray.slice()</code>, and <code>myArray.concat()</code> techniques can be used to deep copy arrays with literal values (boolean, number, and string) only; where <code>slice()</code> has the highest performance in Chrome, and spread <code>...</code> has the highest performance in Firefox.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Array of literal-values (type1) and literal-structures (type2)</strong><br>
The <code>JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(myArray))</code> technique can be used to deep copy literal values (boolean, number, string) and literal structures (array, object), but not prototype objects.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>All arrays (type1, type2, type3)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/UL33O.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Lo-dash</a> <code>cloneDeep(myArray)</code> or <a href="https://lodash.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">jQuery</a> <code>extend(true, [], myArray)</code> techniques can be used to deep-copy all array-types. Where the Lodash <code>cloneDeep()</code> technique has the highest performance.</li>
<li>And for those who avoid third-party libraries, the custom function below will deep-copy all array-types, with lower performance than <code>cloneDeep()</code> and higher performance than <code>extend(true)</code>.</li>

<h2>So to answer the question...</h2>
<h4>Question</h4>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> arr1 = [<span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>];
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> arr2 = arr1;
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>I realized that arr2 refers to the same array as arr1, rather than a new, independent array. How can I copy the array to get two independent arrays?</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Answer</h4>
<p>Because <code>arr1</code> is an array of literal values (boolean, number, or string), you can use any deep copy technique discussed above, where <code>slice()</code> and spread <code>...</code> have the highest performance.</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">arr2 = arr1.<span class="hljs-title function_">slice</span>();
arr2 = [...arr1];
arr2 = arr1.<span class="hljs-title function_">splice</span>(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>);
arr2 = arr1.<span class="hljs-title function_">concat</span>();
arr2 = <span class="hljs-title class_">JSON</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">parse</span>(<span class="hljs-title class_">JSON</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">stringify</span>(arr1));
arr2 = <span class="hljs-title function_">copy</span>(arr1); <span class="hljs-comment">// Custom function needed, and provided above</span>
arr2 = _.<span class="hljs-title function_">cloneDeep</span>(arr1); <span class="hljs-comment">// Lo-dash.js needed</span>

<p>You can use array spreads <code>...</code> to copy arrays.</p>

<p><code>const itemsCopy = [...items];</code></p>

<p>Also if want to create a new array with the existing one being part of it:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> parts = [<span class="hljs-string">'shoulders'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'knees'</span>];
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> lyrics = [<span class="hljs-string">'head'</span>, ...parts, <span class="hljs-string">'and'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'toes'</span>];
</code></pre>

<p>Array spreads are now <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator#Browser_compatibility" rel="noreferrer">supported in all major browsers</a> but if you need older support use typescript or babel and compile to ES5.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>This copys the array from the starting position <code>0</code> through the end of the array.</p>

<p>It is important to note that it will work as expected for primitive types (string, number, etc.), and to also explain the expected behavior for reference types...</p>

<p>If you have an array of Reference types, say of type <code>Object</code>.  The array <strong>will</strong> be copied, but both of the arrays will contain references to the same <code>Object</code>'s.  So in this case it would seem like the array is copied by reference even though the array <strong>is actually copied.</strong></p>

</code></pre>

<p>This will create a new deep copy not related to the first one (not a shallow copy).</p>

<p>Also this obviously will not clone events and functions, but the good thing you can do it in one line, and it can be used for any kind of object (arrays, strings, numbers, objects ...)</p>

<p>An alternative to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice" rel="noreferrer"><code>slice</code></a> is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat" rel="noreferrer"><code>concat</code></a>, which can be used in 2 ways. The first of these is perhaps more readable as the intended behaviour is very clear:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> array2 = [].<span class="hljs-title function_">concat</span>(array1);
</code></pre>

<p>The second method is:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> array2 = array1.<span class="hljs-title function_">concat</span>();
</code></pre>

<p>Cohen (in the comments) pointed out that this latter method <a href="https://jsperf.com/copy-simple-array" rel="noreferrer">has better performance</a>.</p>

<p>The way this works is that the <code>concat</code> method creates a new array consisting of the elements in the object on which it is called followed by the elements of any arrays passed to it as arguments. So when no arguments are passed, it simply copies the array.</p>

<p>Lee Penkman, also in the comments, points out that if there's a chance <code>array1</code> is <code>undefined</code>, you can return an empty array as follows:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> array2 = [].<span class="hljs-title function_">concat</span>(array1 || []);
</code></pre>

<p>Or, for the second method:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> array2 = (array1 || []).<span class="hljs-title function_">concat</span>();
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you can also do this with <code>slice</code>: <code>var array2 = (array1 || []).slice();</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Important!</strong></p>
<p>Most of answers here works for <em><strong>particular cases</strong></em>.</p>
<p>If you don't care about deep/nested objects and props use (<strong>ES6</strong>):</p>
<p><code>let clonedArray = [...array]</code></p>
<p>but if you want to do deep clone use this instead:</p>
<p><code>let cloneArray = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(array))</code>*</p>
<p>*functions won't be preserved (serialized) while using stringify, you will get result without them.</p>

<p>Some of mentioned methods work well when working with simple data types like number or string, but when the array contains other objects these methods fail. When we try to pass any object from one array to another it is passed as a reference, not the object.</p>

<h1>Primitive values are always pass by its value (copied). Compound values however are passed by reference.</h1>

<p>So how do we copy this arr? </p>

<h1> Copy an Array in ES6 </h1>

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> arrCopy = [].<span class="hljs-title function_">concat</span>(arr);
</code></pre>

<h1> Why `let arrCopy = arr` is not passing by value?</h1>

<p>Passing one varible to another on Compound values such as Object/Array behave difrently. Using asign operator on copand values we pass reference to an object. This is why the value of both arrays are changing when removing/adding arr elements.</p>

<h1>Exceptions: </h1>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">arrCopy[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">'adding new value this way will unreference'</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>When you assign a new value to the variable, you are changing the reference itself and it doesnt affect the original Object/Array. </p>

<p>As we know in Javascript <strong>arrays</strong> and <strong>objects</strong> are by reference, but what ways we can do copy the array without changing the original array later one? </p>

<p>Here are few ways to do it:</p>

<p>Imagine we have this array in your code:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> arr = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">4</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>];
</code></pre>

<p>1) Looping through the array in a function and return a new array, like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"> <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">newArr</span>(<span class="hljs-params">arr</span>) {
      <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i=<span class="hljs-number">0</span>, res = [];
      <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span>(i&lt;arr.<span class="hljs-property">length</span>){
       res.<span class="hljs-title function_">push</span>(arr[i]);
        i++;
       }
   <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> res;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>2) Using slice method, slice is for slicing part of the array, it will slice some part of your array without touching the original, in the slice, if don't specify the start and end of the array, it will slice the whole array and basically make a full copy of the array, so we can easily say:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> arr2 = arr.<span class="hljs-title function_">slice</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// make a copy of the original array</span>
</code></pre>

<p>3) Also contact method, this is for merging two array, but we can just specify one of arrays and then this basically make a copy of the values in the new contacted array:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> arr2 = arr.<span class="hljs-title function_">concat</span>();
</code></pre>

<p>4) Also stringify and parse method, it's not recommended, but can be an easy way to copy Array and Objects:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> arr2 = <span class="hljs-title class_">JSON</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">parse</span>(<span class="hljs-title class_">JSON</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">stringify</span>(arr));
</code></pre>

<p>5) Array.from method, this is not widely supported, before use check the support in different browsers:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> arr2 = <span class="hljs-title class_">Array</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">from</span>(arr);
</code></pre>

<p>6) ECMA6 way, also not fully supported, but babelJs can help you if you want to transpile:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> arr2 = [...arr];
</code></pre>

<p>If your array contains elements of the <strong>primitive data type</strong> such as <strong>int, char, or string etc</strong> then you can user one of those methods which returns a copy of the original array such as .slice() or .map() or spread operator(thanks to ES6).</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">new_array = old_array.<span class="hljs-title function_">slice</span>()
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">new_array = old_array.<span class="hljs-title function_">map</span>(<span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">elem</span>) =&gt;</span> elem)

</code></pre>

<p><strong>BUT</strong> if your array contains <strong>complex elements</strong> such as objects(or arrays) or more <strong>nested objects</strong>, then, you will have to make sure that you are making a copy of all the elements from the top level to the last level else reference of the inner objects will be used and that means changing values in object_elements in new_array will still affect the old_array. You can call this method of copying at each level as making a <strong>DEEP COPY</strong>
of the old_array.</p>

<p>For deep copying, you can use the above-mentioned methods for primitive data types at each level depending upon the type of data or you can use this <strong>costly method(mentioned below)</strong> for making a deep copy without doing much work.</p>

<p>There are a lot of other methods out there which you can use depending on your requirements. I have mentioned only some of those for giving a general idea of what happens when we try to copy an array into the other <strong>by value</strong>.</p>

<p>Often when we transform data we want to keep our initial datastructure (e.g. Array) intact. We do this by making a exact copy of our array so this one can be transformed while the initial one stays intact.</p>

<h2>Be careful when arrays or objects are nested!:</h2>

<p>When arrays are nested the values are copied by reference. Here is an example of how this could lead to issues:</p>

<p></p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> arr1 = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>,[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>]]

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> arr2 = [...arr1];

arr2[<span class="hljs-number">2</span>][<span class="hljs-number">0</span>] = <span class="hljs-number">5</span>;  <span class="hljs-comment">// we change arr2</span>

<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(arr1);  <span class="hljs-comment">// arr1 is also changed because the array inside arr1 was copied by reference</span></code></pre>
<div class="snippet-result"><div class="snippet-ctas"><button type="button" class="s-btn s-btn__primary"><span class="icon-play-white _hover"></span><span> Run code snippet</span></button><input class="copySnippet s-btn s-btn__filled" type="button" value="Copy snippet to answer" style="display: none;"><button type="button" class="s-btn hideResults" style="display: none;">Hide results</button><div class="popout-code"><a class="snippet-expand-link">Expand snippet</a></div></div><div class="snippet-result-code" style="display: none;"><iframe name="sif7" sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-scripts" class="snippet-box-edit snippet-box-result" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></div></div>
</div>
<p></p>

<p>So don't use these methods when there are objects or arrays inside your array you want to copy. i.e. Use these methods on arrays of primitives only. </p>

<p>If you do want to deepclone a javascript array use <code>JSON.parse</code> in conjunction with <code>JSON.stringify</code>, like this:</p>

<p></p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> arr1 = [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>,[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>]]

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> arr2 = <span class="hljs-title class_">JSON</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">parse</span>(<span class="hljs-title class_">JSON</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">stringify</span>(arr1)) ;

arr2[<span class="hljs-number">2</span>][<span class="hljs-number">0</span>] = <span class="hljs-number">5</span>;

<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(arr1);  <span class="hljs-comment">// now I'm not modified because I'm a deep clone</span></code></pre>
<div class="snippet-result"><div class="snippet-ctas"><button type="button" class="s-btn s-btn__primary"><span class="icon-play-white _hover"></span><span> Run code snippet</span></button><input class="copySnippet s-btn s-btn__filled" type="button" value="Copy snippet to answer" style="display: none;"><button type="button" class="s-btn hideResults" style="display: none;">Hide results</button><div class="popout-code"><a class="snippet-expand-link">Expand snippet</a></div></div><div class="snippet-result-code" style="display: none;"><iframe name="sif8" sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-scripts" class="snippet-box-edit snippet-box-result" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></div></div>
</div>
<p></p>

<h2>Performance of copying:</h2>

<p>So which one do we choose for optimal performance. It turns out that the most verbose method, the <code>for</code> loop has the highest performance. Use the <code>for</code> loop for really CPU intensive copying (large/many arrays). </p>

<p>After that the <code>.slice()</code> method also has decent performance and is also less verbose and easier for the programmer to implement. I suggest to use <code>.slice()</code> for your everyday copying of arrays which aren't very CPU intensive. Also avoid using the <code>JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(arr))</code> (lots of overhead) if no deep clone is required and performance is an issue.</p>

<p>This way <strong>just</strong> work for <strong>simple Arrays</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have <em><strong>Complex</strong></em> Array like <em>array of Objects</em> then you must use another solutions like:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> arr2 = <span class="hljs-title class_">JSON</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">parse</span>(<span class="hljs-title class_">JSON</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">stringify</span>(arr1)); 
</code></pre>
<p>For example, we have an array of objects that each cell have another <em>array field</em> in its object ... in this situation if we use <strong>slice</strong> method then the array fields will copy <em><strong>by Ref</strong></em> and that's mean these fields <em>updates</em> will <em>affect</em> on orginal array same element and fields.</p>

It turns out that the most verbose method, the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;for\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; loop has the highest performance. Use the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;for\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; loop for really CPU intensive copying (large/many arrays). \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;After that the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;.slice()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; method also has decent performance and is also less verbose and easier for the programmer to implement. I suggest to use \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;.slice()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; for your everyday copying of arrays which aren\u0026apos;t very CPU intensive. Also avoid using the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(arr))\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; (lots of overhead) if no deep clone is required and performance is an issue.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://www.codefellows.org/blog/speed-alley-the-fastest-way-to-copy-an-array/\u0026quot;
