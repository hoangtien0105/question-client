I dislike it, because it is an exception, and thus confuses things.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution7","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Simple Use of const.\n\nThe simplest use is to declare a named constant. To do this, one declares a constant as if it was a variable but add const before it. One has to initialize it immediately in the constructor because, of course, one cannot set the value later as that would be altering it. For example:\n\nconst int Constant1=96; \n\n\nwill create an integer constant, unimaginatively called Constant1, with the value 96.\n\nSuch constants are useful for parameters which are used in the program but are do not need to be changed after the program is compiled. It has an advantage for programmers over the C preprocessor #define command in that it is understood &amp; used by the compiler itself, not just substituted into the program text by the preprocessor before reaching the main compiler, so error messages are much more helpful.\n\nIt also works with pointers but one has to be careful where const to determine whether the pointer or what it points to is constant or both. For example:\n\nconst int * Constant2 \n\n\ndeclares that Constant2 is variable pointer to a constant integer and:\n\nint const * Constant2\n\n\nis an alternative syntax which does the same, whereas\n\nint * const Constant3\n\n\ndeclares that Constant3 is constant pointer to a variable integer and\n\nint const * const Constant4\n\n\ndeclares that Constant4 is constant pointer to a constant integer. Basically const applies to whatever is on its immediate left (other than if there is nothing there in which case it applies to whatever is its immediate right).\n\nref: http://duramecho.com/ComputerInformation/WhyHowCppConst.html\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution8","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"It&apos;s simple but tricky.

I suppose the question here has simply been about C, but I&apos;ll give some related examples since the tag is C++ :\n\n\nYou often pass large arguments like strings as TYPE const &amp; which prevents the object from being either modified or copied.  Example :\n\nTYPE&amp; TYPE::operator=(const TYPE &amp;rhs) { ... return *this; }\n\nBut TYPE &amp;  const is meaningless because references are always const.\nYou should always label class methods that do not modify the class as const, otherwise you cannot call the method from a TYPE const &amp; reference.  Example :\n\nbool TYPE::operator==(const TYPE &amp;rhs) const { ... }\nThere are common situations where both the return value and the method should be const.  Example :\n\nconst TYPE TYPE::operator+(const TYPE &amp;rhs) const { ... }\n\nIn fact, const methods must not return internal class data as a reference-to-non-const.\nAs a result, one must often create both a const and a non-const method using const overloading.  For example, if you define T const&amp; operator[] (unsigned i) const;, then you&apos;ll probably also want the non-const version given by :\n\ninline T&amp; operator[] (unsigned i) {\n  return const_cast&lt;char&amp;&gt;( \n     static_cast&lt;const TYPE&amp;&gt;(*this)[](i)\n  );\n}\n\n\nAfaik, there are no const functions in C, non-member functions cannot themselves be const in C++, const methods might have side effects, and the compiler cannot use const functions to avoid duplicate function calls.

It means that you can&apos;t change it through that pointer (meaning, you can&apos;t assign $*p = ...`). The value itself may be changed in other ways. Eg\n\nint x = 5;\nconst int *p = &amp;x;\nx = 6; //legal\nprintf(&quot;%d&quot;, *p) // prints 6\n*p = 7; //error \n\n\nThis is meant to be used mostly in function signatures, to guarantee that the function can&apos;t accidentally change the arguments passed.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution16","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"This mostly addresses the second line: best practices, assignments, function parameters etc.\n\nGeneral practice.  Try to make everything const that you can.  Or to put that another way, make everything const to begin with, and then remove exactly the minimum set of consts necessary to allow the program to function.  This will be a big help in attaining const-correctness, and will help ensure that subtle bugs don&apos;t get introduced when people try and assign into things they&apos;re not supposed to modify.\n\nAvoid const_cast&lt;&gt; like the plague.  There are one or two legitimate use cases for it, but they are very few and far between.  If you&apos;re trying to change a const object, you&apos;ll do a lot better to find whoever declared it const in the first pace and talk the matter over with them to reach a consensus as to what should happen.\n\nWhich leads very neatly into assignments.  You can assign into something only if it is non-const.  If you want to assign into something that is const, see above.  Remember that in the declarations int const *foo; and int * const bar; different things are const - other answers here have covered that issue admirably, so I won&apos;t go into it.\n\nFunction parameters:\n\nPass by value: e.g. void func(int param) you don&apos;t care one way or the other at the calling site.  The argument can be made that there are use cases for declaring the function as void func(int const param) but that has no effect on the caller, only on the function itself, in that whatever value is passed cannot be changed by the function during the call.\n\nPass by reference: e.g. void func(int &amp;param) Now it does make a difference.  As just declared func is allowed to change param, and any calling site should be ready to deal with the consequences.  Changing the declaration to void func(int const &amp;param) changes the contract, and guarantees that func can now not change param, meaning what is passed in is what will come back out.  As other have noted this is very useful for cheaply passing a large object that you don&apos;t want to change.  Passing a reference is a lot cheaper than passing a large object by value.\n\nPass by pointer: e.g. void func(int *param) and void func(int const *param) These two are pretty much synonymous with their reference counterparts, with the caveat that the called function now needs to check for nullptr unless some other contractual guarantee assures func that it will never receive a nullptr in param.\n\nOpinion piece on that topic.  Proving correctness in a case like this is hellishly difficult, it&apos;s just too damn easy to make a mistake.  So don&apos;t take chances, and always check pointer parameters for nullptr.  You will save yourself pain and suffering and hard to find bugs in the long term.  And as for the cost of the check, it&apos;s dirt cheap, and in cases where the static analysis built into the compiler can manage it, the optimizer will elide it anyway.  Turn on Link Time Code Generation for MSVC, or WOPR (I think) for GCC, and you&apos;ll get it program wide, i.e. even in function calls that cross a source code module boundary.\n\nAt the end of the day all of the above makes a very solid case to always prefer references to pointers.  They&apos;re just safer all round.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution17","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Just for the sake of completeness for C following the others explanations, not sure for C++.\n\n\npp - pointer to pointer\np - pointer\ndata - the thing pointed, in examples x\nbold - read-only variable\n\n\nPointer\n\n\np data - int *p;\np data - int const *p;\np data - int * const p;\np data - int const * const p;\n\n\nPointer to pointer\n\n\npp p data - int **pp;\npp p data - int ** const pp;\npp p data - int * const *pp;\npp p data - int const **pp;\npp p data - int * const * const pp;\npp p data - int const ** const pp;\npp p data - int const * const *pp;\npp p data - int const * const * const pp;\n\n\n// Example 1\nint x;\nx = 10;\nint *p = NULL;\np = &amp;x;\nint **pp = NULL;\npp = &amp;p;\nprintf(&quot;%d\\n&quot;, **pp);\n\n// Example 2\nint x;\nx = 10;\nint *p = NULL;\np = &amp;x;\nint ** const pp = &amp;p; // Definition must happen during declaration\nprintf(&quot;%d\\n&quot;, **pp);\n\n// Example 3\nint x;\nx = 10;\nint * const p = &amp;x; // Definition must happen during declaration\nint * const *pp = NULL;\npp = &amp;p;\nprintf(&quot;%d\\n&quot;, **pp);\n\n// Example 4\nint const x = 10; // Definition must happen during declaration\nint const * p = NULL;\np = &amp;x;\nint const **pp = NULL;\npp = &amp;p;\nprintf(&quot;%d\\n&quot;, **pp);\n\n// Example 5\nint x;\nx = 10;\nint * const p = &amp;x; // Definition must happen during declaration\nint * const * const pp = &amp;p; // Definition must happen during declaration\nprintf(&quot;%d\\n&quot;, **pp);\n\n// Example 6\nint const x = 10; // Definition must happen during declaration\nint const *p = NULL;\np = &amp;x;\nint const ** const pp = &amp;p; // Definition must happen during declaration\nprintf(&quot;%d\\n&quot;, **pp);\n\n// Example 7\nint const x = 10; // Definition must happen during declaration\nint const * const p = &amp;x; // Definition must happen during declaration\nint const * const *pp = NULL;\npp = &amp;p;\nprintf(&quot;%d\\n&quot;, **pp);\n\n// Example 8\nint const x = 10; // Definition must happen during declaration\nint const * const p = &amp;x; // Definition must happen during declaration\nint const * const * const pp = &amp;p; // Definition must happen during declaration\nprintf(&quot;%d\\n&quot;, **pp);\n\n\nN-levels of Dereference\n\nJust keep going, but may the humanity excommunicate you.\n\nint x = 10;\nint *p = &amp;x;\nint **pp = &amp;p;\nint ***ppp = &amp;pp;\nint ****pppp = &amp;ppp;\n\nprintf(&quot;%d \\n&quot;, ****pppp);\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution18","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"\nconst int* - pointer to constant int object.\n\n\nYou can change the value of the pointer; you can not change the value of the int object, the pointer points to.\n\n\n\n\nconst int * const - constant pointer to constant int object.\n\n\nYou can not change the value of the pointer nor the value of the int object the pointer points to.\n\n\n\n\nint const * - pointer to constant int object.\n\n\nThis statement is equivalent to 1. const int* - You can change the value of the pointer but you can not change the value of the int object, the pointer points to.\n\n\n\nActually, there is a 4th option:\n\n\nint * const - constant pointer to int object.\n\n\nYou can change the value of the object the pointer points to but you can not change the value of the pointer itself.

<p>Read it backwards (as driven by <a href="http://c-faq.com/decl/spiral.anderson.html" rel="noreferrer">Clockwise/Spiral Rule</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>int*</code> - pointer to int</li>
<li><code>int const *</code> - pointer to const int</li>
<li><code>int * const</code> - const pointer to int</li>
<li><code>int const * const</code> - const pointer to const int</li>
</ul>

<p>Now the first <code>const</code> can be on either side of the type so:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>const int *</code> == <code>int const *</code></li>
<li><code>const int * const</code> == <code>int const * const</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to go really crazy you can do things like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>int **</code> - pointer to pointer to int</li>
<li><code>int ** const</code> - a const pointer to a pointer to an int</li>
<li><code>int * const *</code> - a pointer to a const pointer to an int</li>
<li><code>int const **</code> - a pointer to a pointer to a const int</li>
<li><code>int * const * const</code> - a const pointer to a const pointer to an int</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>And to make sure we are clear on the meaning of <code>const</code>:</p>

<p><code>foo</code> is a variable pointer to a constant integer. This lets you change what you point to but not the value that you point to. Most often this is seen with C-style strings where you have a pointer to a <code>const char</code>. You may change which string you point to but you can't change the content of these strings. This is important when the string itself is in the data segment of a program and shouldn't be changed.</p>

<p><code>bar</code> is a constant or fixed pointer to a value that can be changed. This is like a reference without the extra syntactic sugar. Because of this fact, usually you would use a reference where you would use a <code>T* const</code> pointer unless you need to allow <code>NULL</code> pointers.</p>

<p>For those who don't know about Clockwise/Spiral Rule:
Start from the name of the variable, move clockwisely (in this case, move backward) to the next <strong>pointer</strong> or <strong>type</strong>. Repeat until expression ends.</p>

<p>Here is a demo:</p>

<p>I think everything is answered here already, but I just want to add that you should beware of <code>typedef</code>s! They're NOT just text replacements.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-keyword">typedef</span> <span class="hljs-type">char</span> *ASTRING;
<span class="hljs-type">const</span> ASTRING astring;
</code></pre>

<p>The type of <code>astring</code> is <code>char * const</code>, not <code>const char *</code>. This is one reason I always tend to put <code>const</code> to the right of the type, and never at the start.</p>

<li><p><strong>Constant reference:</strong></p>

<p>A reference to a variable (here int), which is constant. We pass the variable as a reference mainly, because references are smaller in size than the actual value, but there is a side effect and that is because it is like an alias to the actual variable. We may accidentally change the main variable through our full access to the alias, so we make it constant to prevent this side effect.</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> var0 = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;

<li><p><strong>Constant pointers</strong></p>

<p>Once a constant pointer points to a variable then it cannot point to any other variable. </p>

<p>In short, I find the easiest way to remember the rule is that the "const" goes <em>after</em> the thing it applies to. So in your question, "int const *" means that the int is constant, while "int * const" would mean that the pointer is constant.</p>

<p>If someone decides to put it at the very front (eg: "const int *"), as a special exception in that case it applies to the thing after it.</p>

<p>Many people like to use that special exception because they think it looks nicer. I dislike it, because it is an exception, and thus confuses things.</p>

<p>Simple Use of <code>const</code>.</p>

<p>The simplest use is to declare a named constant. To do this, one declares a constant as if it was a variable but add <code>const</code> before it. One has to initialize it immediately in the constructor because, of course, one cannot set the value later as that would be altering it. For example:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> Constant1=<span class="hljs-number">96</span>; 
</code></pre>

<p>will create an integer constant, unimaginatively called <code>Constant1</code>, with the value 96.</p>

<p>Such constants are useful for parameters which are used in the program but are do not need to be changed after the program is compiled. It has an advantage for programmers over the C preprocessor <code>#define</code> command in that it is understood &amp; used by the compiler itself, not just substituted into the program text by the preprocessor before reaching the main compiler, so error messages are much more helpful.</p>

<p>It also works with pointers but one has to be careful where <code>const</code> to determine whether the pointer or what it points to is constant or both. For example:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> * Constant2 
</code></pre>

<p>declares that <code>Constant2</code> is variable pointer to a constant integer and:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> * Constant2
</code></pre>

<p>is an alternative syntax which does the same, whereas</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> Constant3
</code></pre>

<p>declares that <code>Constant3</code> is constant pointer to a variable integer and</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> Constant4
</code></pre>

<p>declares that <code>Constant4</code> is constant pointer to a constant integer. Basically const applies to whatever is on its immediate left (other than if there is nothing there in which case it applies to whatever is its immediate right).</p>

<p>There are many other subtle points surrounding const correctness in C++.  I suppose the question here has simply been about C, but I'll give some related examples since the tag is C++ :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You often pass large arguments like strings as <code>TYPE const &amp;</code> which prevents the object from being either modified or copied.  Example :</p>

<p><code>TYPE&amp; TYPE::operator=(const TYPE &amp;rhs) { ... return *this; }</code></p>

<p>But <code>TYPE &amp;  const</code> is meaningless because references are always const.</p></li>
<li><p>You should always label class methods that do not modify the class as <code>const</code>, otherwise you cannot call the method from a <code>TYPE const &amp;</code> reference.  Example :</p>

<p><code>bool TYPE::operator==(const TYPE &amp;rhs) const { ... }</code></p></li>
<li><p>There are common situations where both the return value and the method should be const.  Example :</p>

<p><code>const TYPE TYPE::operator+(const TYPE &amp;rhs) const { ... }</code></p>

<p>In fact, const methods must not return internal class data as a reference-to-non-const.</p></li>
<li><p>As a result, one must often create both a const and a non-const method using const overloading.  For example, if you define <code>T const&amp; operator[] (unsigned i) const;</code>, then you'll probably also want the non-const version given by :</p>

<p><code>inline T&amp; operator[] (unsigned i) {
  return const_cast&lt;char&amp;&gt;( 
     static_cast&lt;const TYPE&amp;&gt;(*this)[](i)
  );
}</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Afaik, there are no const functions in C, non-member functions cannot themselves be const in C++, const methods might have side effects, and the compiler cannot use const functions to avoid duplicate function calls.  In fact, even a simple <code>int const &amp;</code> reference might witness the value to which it refers be changed elsewhere.</p>

<p>The const with the int on either sides will make <strong>pointer to constant int</strong>:</p>

<p>This mostly addresses the second line: best practices, assignments, function parameters etc.</p>

<p>General practice.  Try to make everything <code>const</code> that you can.  Or to put that another way, make everything <code>const</code> to begin with, and then remove exactly the minimum set of <code>const</code>s necessary to allow the program to function.  This will be a big help in attaining const-correctness, and will help ensure that subtle bugs don't get introduced when people try and assign into things they're not supposed to modify.</p>

<p>Avoid const_cast&lt;&gt; like the plague.  There are one or two legitimate use cases for it, but they are very few and far between.  If you're trying to change a <code>const</code> object, you'll do a lot better to find whoever declared it <code>const</code> in the first pace and talk the matter over with them to reach a consensus as to what should happen.</p>

<p>Which leads very neatly into assignments.  You can assign into something only if it is non-const.  If you want to assign into something that is const, see above.  Remember that in the declarations <code>int const *foo;</code> and <code>int * const bar;</code> different things are <code>const</code> - other answers here have covered that issue admirably, so I won't go into it.</p>

<p>Function parameters:</p>

<p>Pass by value: e.g. <code>void func(int param)</code> you don't care one way or the other at the calling site.  The argument can be made that there are use cases for declaring the function as <code>void func(int const param)</code> but that has no effect on the caller, only on the function itself, in that whatever value is passed cannot be changed by the function during the call.</p>

<p>Pass by reference: e.g. <code>void func(int &amp;param)</code> Now it does make a difference.  As just declared <code>func</code> is allowed to change <code>param</code>, and any calling site should be ready to deal with the consequences.  Changing the declaration to <code>void func(int const &amp;param)</code> changes the contract, and guarantees that <code>func</code> can now not change <code>param</code>, meaning what is passed in is what will come back out.  As other have noted this is very useful for cheaply passing a large object that you don't want to change.  Passing a reference is a lot cheaper than passing a large object by value.</p>

<p>Pass by pointer: e.g. <code>void func(int *param)</code> and <code>void func(int const *param)</code> These two are pretty much synonymous with their reference counterparts, with the caveat that the called function now needs to check for <code>nullptr</code> unless some other contractual guarantee assures <code>func</code> that it will never receive a <code>nullptr</code> in <code>param</code>.</p>

<p>Opinion piece on that topic.  Proving correctness in a case like this is hellishly difficult, it's just too damn easy to make a mistake.  So don't take chances, and always check pointer parameters for <code>nullptr</code>.  You will save yourself pain and suffering and hard to find bugs in the long term.  And as for the cost of the check, it's dirt cheap, and in cases where the static analysis built into the compiler can manage it, the optimizer will elide it anyway.  Turn on Link Time Code Generation for MSVC, or WOPR (I think) for GCC, and you'll get it program wide, i.e. even in function calls that cross a source code module boundary.</p>

<p>At the end of the day all of the above makes a very solid case to always prefer references to pointers.  They're just safer all round.</p>

<ol start="2">

<ol start="3">

<p>This statement is equivalent to 1. <code>const int*</code> - You can change the value of the pointer but you can not change the value of the <code>int</code> object, the pointer points to.</p>

<hr>

<p>Actually, there is a 4th option:</p>

<ol start="4">
<li><code>int * const</code> - constant pointer to <code>int</code> object.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can change the value of the object the pointer points to but you can not change the value of the pointer itself. The pointer will always point to the same <code>int</code> object but this value of this <code>int</code> object can be changed.</p>

<p>I like to think of <code>int *i</code> as declaring "the dereference of <code>i</code> is <code>int</code>"; in this sense, <code>const int *i</code> means "the deref of <code>i</code> is <code>const int</code>", while <code>int *const i</code> means "deref of <code>const i</code> is <code>int</code>".</p>

is a variable pointer to a constant integer. This lets you change what you point to but not the value that you point to. Most often this is seen with C-style strings where you have a pointer to a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;const char\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. You may change which string you point to but you can\u0026apos;t change the content of these strings.

This is like a reference without the extra syntactic sugar. Because of this fact, usually you would use a reference where you would use a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;T* const\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; pointer unless you need to allow \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;NULL\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; pointers.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;For those who don\u0026apos;t know about Clockwise/Spiral Rule:\nStart from the name of the variable, move clockwisely (in this case, move backward) to the next \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;pointer\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;type\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;.

To do this, one declares a constant as if it was a variable but add \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;const\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; before it.

Try to make everything \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;const\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; that you can.  Or to put that another way, make everything \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;const\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to begin with, and then remove exactly the minimum set of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;const\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;s necessary to allow the program to function.  This will be a big help in attaining const-correctness, and will help ensure that subtle bugs don\u0026apos;t get introduced when people try and assign into things they\u0026apos;re not supposed to modify.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Avoid const_cast\u0026amp;lt;\u0026amp;gt; like the plague.  There are one or two legitimate use cases for it, but they are very few and far between.  If you\u0026apos;re trying to change a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;const\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; object, you\u0026apos;ll do a lot better to find whoever declared it \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;const\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; in the first pace and talk the matter over with them to reach a consensus as to what should happen.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Which leads very neatly into assignments.  You can assign into something only if it is non-const.  If you want to assign into something that is const, see above.  Remember that in the declarations \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;int const *foo;\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;int * const bar;\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; different things are \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;const\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; - other answers here have covered that issue admirably, so I won\u0026apos;t go into it.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Function parameters:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Pass by value: e.g. \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;void func(int param)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; you don\u0026apos;t care one way or the other at the calling site.  The argument can be made that there are use cases for declaring the function as \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;void func(int const param)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; but that has no effect on the caller, only on the function itself, in that whatever value is passed cannot be changed by the function during the call.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Pass by reference: e.g. \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;void func(int \u0026amp;amp;param)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; Now it does make a difference.  As just declared \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;func\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is allowed to change \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;param\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, and any calling site should be ready to deal with the consequences.  Changing the declaration to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;void func(int const \u0026amp;amp;param)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; changes the contract, and guarantees that \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;func\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; can now not change \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;param\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, meaning what is passed in is what will come back out.  As other have noted this is very useful for cheaply passing a large object that you don\u0026apos;t want to change.  Passing a reference is a lot cheaper than passing a large object by value.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Pass by pointer: e.g. \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;void func(int *param)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;void func(int const *param)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; These two are pretty much synonymous with their reference counterparts, with the caveat that the called function now needs to check for \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;nullptr\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; unless some other contractual guarantee assures \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;func\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; that it will never receive a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;nullptr\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; in \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;param\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Opinion piece on that topic.  Proving correctness in a case like this is hellishly difficult, it\u0026apos;s just too damn easy to make a mistake.  So don\u0026apos;t take chances, and always check pointer parameters for \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;nullptr\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.  You will save yourself pain and suffering and hard to find bugs in the long term.  And as for the cost of the check, it\u0026apos;s dirt cheap, and in cases where the static analysis built into the compiler can manage it, the optimizer will elide it anyway.  Turn on Link Time Code Generation for MSVC, or WOPR (I think) for GCC, and you\u0026apos;ll get it program wide, i.e. even in function calls that cross a source code module boundary.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;At the end of the day all of the above makes a very solid case to always prefer references to pointers.  They\u0026apos;re just safer all round.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Just for the sake of completeness for C following the others explanations, not sure for C++.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;pp - pointer to pointer\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;p - pointer\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;data - the thing pointed, in examples \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;x\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;bold\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;
