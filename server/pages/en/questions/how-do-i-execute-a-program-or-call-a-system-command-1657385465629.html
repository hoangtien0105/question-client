See the Replacing Older Functions with the subprocess Module section in the subprocess documentation for some helpful recipes.\n\nOn Python 3.4 and earlier, use subprocess.call instead of .run:\nsubprocess.call([&quot;ls&quot;, &quot;-l&quot;])\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Summary of ways to call external programs, including their advantages and disadvantages:\n\nos.system passes the command and arguments to your system&apos;s shell. This is nice because you can actually run multiple commands at once in this manner and set up pipes and input/output redirection. For example:\nos.system(&quot;some_command &lt; input_file | another_command &gt; output_file&quot;)  \n\nHowever, while this is convenient, you have to manually handle the escaping of shell characters such as spaces, et cetera. On the other hand, this also lets you run commands which are simply shell commands and not actually external programs.\n\nos.popen will do the same thing as os.system except that it gives you a file-like object that you can use to access standard input/output for that process. There are 3 other variants of popen that all handle the i/o slightly differently. If you pass everything as a string, then your command is passed to the shell; if you pass them as a list then you don&apos;t need to worry about escaping anything. Example:\nprint(os.popen(&quot;ls -l&quot;).read())\n\n\nsubprocess.Popen. This is intended as a replacement for os.popen, but has the downside of being slightly more complicated by virtue of being so comprehensive. For example, you&apos;d say:\nprint subprocess.Popen(&quot;echo Hello World&quot;, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE).stdout.read()\n\ninstead of\nprint os.popen(&quot;echo Hello World&quot;).read()\n\nbut it is nice to have all of the options there in one unified class instead of 4 different popen functions. See the documentation.\n\nsubprocess.call. This is basically just like the Popen class and takes all of the same arguments, but it simply waits until the command completes and gives you the return code. For example:\nreturn_code = subprocess.call(&quot;echo Hello World&quot;, shell=True)\n\n\nsubprocess.run. Python 3.5+ only. Similar to the above but even more flexible and returns a CompletedProcess object when the command finishes executing.\n\nos.fork, os.exec, os.spawn are similar to their C language counterparts, but I don&apos;t recommend using them directly.\n\n\nThe subprocess module should probably be what you use.\nFinally, please be aware that for all methods where you pass the final command to be executed by the shell as a string and you are responsible for escaping it. There are serious security implications if any part of the string that you pass can not be fully trusted. For example, if a user is entering some/any part of the string. If you are unsure, only use these methods with constants. To give you a hint of the implications consider this code:\nprint subprocess.Popen(&quot;echo %s &quot; % user_input, stdout=PIPE).stdout.read()\n\nand imagine that the user enters something &quot;my mama didnt love me &amp;&amp; rm -rf /&quot; which could erase the whole filesystem.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Typical implementation:\nimport subprocess\n\np = subprocess.Popen(&apos;ls&apos;, shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)\nfor line in p.stdout.readlines():\n    print line,\nretval = p.wait()\n\nYou are free to do what you want with the stdout data in the pipe.

That is, the child process should live longer than the CGI script execution process.\n\nThe classical example from the subprocess module documentation is:\n\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\n# Some code here\n\npid = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, &quot;longtask.py&quot;]) # Call subprocess\n\n# Some more code here\n\n\nThe idea here is that you do not want to wait in the line &apos;call subprocess&apos; until the longtask.py is finished. But it is not clear what happens after the line &apos;some more code here&apos; from the example.\n\nMy target platform was FreeBSD, but the development was on Windows, so I faced the problem on Windows first.\n\nOn Windows (Windows XP), the parent process will not finish until the longtask.py has finished its work. It is not what you want in a CGI script. The problem is not specific to Python; in the PHP community the problems are the same.\n\nThe solution is to pass DETACHED_PROCESS Process Creation Flag to the underlying CreateProcess function in Windows API.\nIf you happen to have installed pywin32, you can import the flag from the win32process module, otherwise you should define it yourself:\n\nDETACHED_PROCESS = 0x00000008\n\npid = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, &quot;longtask.py&quot;],\n                       creationflags=DETACHED_PROCESS).pid\n\n\n/* UPD 2015.10.27 @eryksun in a comment below notes, that the semantically correct flag is CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE (0x00000010) */\n\nOn FreeBSD we have another problem: when the parent process is finished, it finishes the child processes as well. And that is not what you want in a CGI script either. Some experiments showed that the problem seemed to be in sharing sys.stdout. And the working solution was the following:\n\npid = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, &quot;longtask.py&quot;], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE, stdin=subprocess.PIPE)\n\n\nI have not checked the code on other platforms and do not know the reasons of the behaviour on FreeBSD.

Available from Python 3.7.\ntext=True - a convenience argument added in Python 3.7 which converts the received binary data to Python strings you can easily work with.\nChecking the returncode\nDo\nif result.returncode == 127: print(&quot;The program failed for some weird reason&quot;)\nelif result.returncode == 0: print(&quot;The program succeeded&quot;)\nelse: print(&quot;The program failed unexpectedly&quot;)\n\nIf you just want to check if the program succeeded (returncode == 0) and otherwise throw an Exception, there is a more convenient function:\nresult.check_returncode()\n\nBut it&apos;s Python, so there&apos;s an even more convenient argument check which does the same thing automatically for you:\nresult = subprocess.run(..., check=True)\n\nstderr should be inside stdout\nYou might want to have all program output inside stdout, even errors. To accomplish this, run\nresult = subprocess.run(..., stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)\n\nresult.stderr will then be None and result.stdout will contain everything.\nUsing shell=False with an argument string\nshell=False expects a list of arguments. You might however, split an argument string on your own using shlex.\nimport subprocess\nimport shlex\nsubprocess.run(shlex.split(&quot;ls -a&quot;))\n\nThat&apos;s it.\nCommon Problems\nChances are high you just started using Python when you come across this question. Let&apos;s look at some common problems.\n\nFileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: &apos;ls -a&apos;: &apos;ls -a&apos;\n\nYou&apos;re running a subprocess without shell=True . Either use a list ([&quot;ls&quot;, &quot;-a&quot;]) or set shell=True.\n\nTypeError: [...] NoneType [...]\n\nCheck that you&apos;ve set capture_output=True.\n\nTypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not [...]\n\nYou always receive byte results from your program. If you want to work with it like a normal string, set text=True.\n\nsubprocess.CalledProcessError: Command &apos;[...]&apos; returned non-zero exit status 1.\n\nYour command didn&apos;t run successfully. You could disable returncode checking or check your actual program&apos;s validity.\n\nTypeError: init() got an unexpected keyword argument [...]\n\nYou&apos;re likely using a version of Python older than 3.7.0; update it to the most recent one available.

<p>Summary of ways to call external programs, including their advantages and disadvantages:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.system" rel="noreferrer"><code>os.system</code></a> passes the command and arguments to your system's shell. This is nice because you can actually run multiple commands at once in this manner and set up pipes and input/output redirection. For example:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">os.system(<span class="hljs-string">"some_command &lt; input_file | another_command &gt; output_file"</span>)  
</code></pre>
<p>However, while this is convenient, you have to manually handle the escaping of shell characters such as spaces, et cetera. On the other hand, this also lets you run commands which are simply shell commands and not actually external programs.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.popen" rel="noreferrer"><code>os.popen</code></a> will do the same thing as <code>os.system</code> except that it gives you a file-like object that you can use to access standard input/output for that process. There are 3 other variants of popen that all handle the i/o slightly differently. If you pass everything as a string, then your command is passed to the shell; if you pass them as a list then you don't need to worry about escaping anything. Example:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(os.popen(<span class="hljs-string">"ls -l"</span>).read())
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen" rel="noreferrer"><code>subprocess.Popen</code></a>. This is intended as a replacement for <code>os.popen</code>, but has the downside of being slightly more complicated by virtue of being so comprehensive. For example, you'd say:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> subprocess.Popen(<span class="hljs-string">"echo Hello World"</span>, shell=<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>, stdout=subprocess.PIPE).stdout.read()
</code></pre>
<p>instead of</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> os.popen(<span class="hljs-string">"echo Hello World"</span>).read()
</code></pre>
<p>but it is nice to have all of the options there in one unified class instead of 4 different popen functions. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor" rel="noreferrer">the documentation</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.call" rel="noreferrer"><code>subprocess.call</code></a>. This is basically just like the <code>Popen</code> class and takes all of the same arguments, but it simply waits until the command completes and gives you the return code. For example:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">return_code = subprocess.call(<span class="hljs-string">"echo Hello World"</span>, shell=<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run" rel="noreferrer"><code>subprocess.run</code></a>. Python 3.5+ only. Similar to the above but even more flexible and returns a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.CompletedProcess" rel="noreferrer"><code>CompletedProcess</code></a> object when the command finishes executing.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>os.fork</code>, <code>os.exec</code>, <code>os.spawn</code> are similar to their C language counterparts, but I don't recommend using them directly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>subprocess</code> module should probably be what you use.</p>
<p>Finally, please be aware that for all methods where you pass the final command to be executed by the shell as a string and you are responsible for escaping it. <strong>There are serious security implications</strong> if any part of the string that you pass can not be fully trusted. For example, if a user is entering some/any part of the string. If you are unsure, only use these methods with constants. To give you a hint of the implications consider this code:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> subprocess.Popen(<span class="hljs-string">"echo %s "</span> % user_input, stdout=PIPE).stdout.read()
</code></pre>
<p>and imagine that the user enters something "<code>my mama didnt love me &amp;&amp; rm -rf /</code>" which could erase the whole filesystem.</p>

<p>Some hints on detaching the child process from the calling one (starting the child process in background).</p>

<p>Suppose you want to start a long task from a CGI script. That is, the child process should live longer than the CGI script execution process.</p>

<p>The classical example from the subprocess module documentation is:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-coffeescript"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> subprocess
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> sys

<span class="hljs-comment"># Some code here</span>

pid = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, <span class="hljs-string">"longtask.py"</span>]) <span class="hljs-comment"># Call subprocess</span>

<span class="hljs-comment"># Some more code here</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The idea here is that you do not want to wait in the line 'call subprocess' until the longtask.py is finished. But it is not clear what happens after the line 'some more code here' from the example.</p>

<p>My target platform was FreeBSD, but the development was on Windows, so I faced the problem on Windows first.</p>

<p>On Windows (Windows&nbsp;XP), the parent process will not finish until the longtask.py has finished its work. It is not what you want in a CGI script. The problem is not specific to Python; in the PHP community the problems are the same.</p>

<p>The solution is to pass DETACHED_PROCESS <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684863(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="noreferrer">Process Creation Flag</a> to the underlying CreateProcess function in Windows API.
If you happen to have installed pywin32, you can import the flag from the win32process module, otherwise you should define it yourself:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-ini"><span class="hljs-attr">DETACHED_PROCESS</span> = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>x00000008

<span class="hljs-attr">pid</span> = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, <span class="hljs-string">"longtask.py"</span>],
                       <span class="hljs-attr">creationflags</span>=DETACHED_PROCESS).pid
</code></pre>

<p>/* <em>UPD 2015.10.27</em> @eryksun in a comment below notes, that the semantically correct flag is CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE (0x00000010) */</p>

<p>On FreeBSD we have another problem: when the parent process is finished, it finishes the child processes as well. And that is not what you want in a CGI script either. Some experiments showed that the problem seemed to be in sharing sys.stdout. And the working solution was the following:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-lua">pid = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, <span class="hljs-string">"longtask.py"</span>], <span class="hljs-built_in">stdout</span>=subprocess.PIPE, <span class="hljs-built_in">stderr</span>=subprocess.PIPE, <span class="hljs-built_in">stdin</span>=subprocess.PIPE)
</code></pre>

<p>I have not checked the code on other platforms and do not know the reasons of the behaviour on FreeBSD. If anyone knows, please share your ideas. Googling on starting background processes in Python does not shed any light yet.</p>

<p>Note that this is dangerous, since the command isn't cleaned. I leave it up to you to google for the relevant documentation on the 'os' and 'sys' modules. There are a bunch of functions (exec* and spawn*) that will do similar things.</p>

<h3>These are all the libraries</h3>
<p>Hopefully this will help you make a decision on which library to use :)</p>
<h3><em>subprocess</em></h3>
<p>Subprocess allows you to call external commands and connect them to their input/output/error pipes (stdin, stdout, and stderr). Subprocess is the default choice for running commands, but sometimes other modules are better.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-perl">subprocess.run([<span class="hljs-string">"ls"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"-l"</span>]) <span class="hljs-comment"># Run command</span>
subprocess.run([<span class="hljs-string">"ls"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"-l"</span>], stdout=subprocess.PIPE) <span class="hljs-comment"># This will run the command and return any output</span>
subprocess.run(shlex.<span class="hljs-keyword">split</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"ls -l"</span>)) <span class="hljs-comment"># You can also use the shlex library to split the command</span>
</code></pre>
<h3><em>os</em></h3>
<p>os is used for "operating system dependent functionality". It can also be used to call external commands with <code>os.system</code> and <code>os.popen</code> (Note: There is also a subprocess.popen). os will always run the shell and is a simple alternative for people who don't need to, or don't know how to use <code>subprocess.run</code>.</p>
<pre class="lang-python s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">os.system(<span class="hljs-string">"ls -l"</span>) <span class="hljs-comment"># Run command</span>
os.popen(<span class="hljs-string">"ls -l"</span>).read() <span class="hljs-comment"># This will run the command and return any output</span>
</code></pre>
<h3><em>sh</em></h3>
<p>sh is a subprocess interface which lets you call programs as if they were functions. This is useful if you want to run a command multiple times.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-makefile">sh.ls(<span class="hljs-string">"-l"</span>) <span class="hljs-comment"># Run command normally</span>
ls_cmd = sh.Command(<span class="hljs-string">"ls"</span>) <span class="hljs-comment"># Save command as a variable</span>
ls_cmd() <span class="hljs-comment"># Run command as if it were a function</span>
</code></pre>
<h3><em>plumbum</em></h3>
<p>plumbum is a library for "script-like" Python programs. You can call programs like functions as in <code>sh</code>. Plumbum is useful if you want to run a pipeline without the shell.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-makefile">ls_cmd = plumbum.local(<span class="hljs-string">"ls -l"</span>) <span class="hljs-comment"># Get command</span>
ls_cmd() <span class="hljs-comment"># Run command</span>
</code></pre>
<h3><em>pexpect</em></h3>
<p>pexpect lets you spawn child applications, control them and find patterns in their output. This is a better alternative to subprocess for commands that expect a tty on Unix.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-kotlin">pexpect.run(<span class="hljs-string">"ls -l"</span>) # Run command <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> normal
child = pexpect.spawn(<span class="hljs-string">'scp foo user@example.com:.'</span>) # Spawns child application
child.<span class="hljs-keyword">expect</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'Password:'</span>) # When <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> the output
child.sendline(<span class="hljs-string">'mypassword'</span>)
</code></pre>
<h3><em>fabric</em></h3>
<p>fabric is a Python 2.5 and 2.7 library. It allows you to execute local and remote shell commands. Fabric is simple alternative for running commands in a secure shell (SSH)</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">fabric.operations.local(<span class="hljs-string">'ls -l'</span>) <span class="hljs-comment"># Run command as normal</span>
fabric.operations.local(<span class="hljs-string">'ls -l'</span>, capture = <span class="hljs-literal">True</span>) <span class="hljs-comment"># Run command and receive output</span>
</code></pre>
<h3><em>envoy</em></h3>
<p>envoy is known as "subprocess for humans". It is used as a convenience wrapper around the <code>subprocess</code> module.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-makefile">r = envoy.run(<span class="hljs-string">"ls -l"</span>) <span class="hljs-comment"># Run command</span>
r.std_out <span class="hljs-comment"># Get output</span>
</code></pre>
<h3><em>commands</em></h3>
<p><code>commands</code> contains wrapper functions for <code>os.popen</code>, but it has been removed from Python 3 since <code>subprocess</code> is a better alternative.</p>

<h3>With the standard library</h3>

<p>Use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run" rel="noreferrer">subprocess module</a> (Python 3):</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css">import subprocess
subprocess<span class="hljs-selector-class">.run</span>(<span class="hljs-selector-attr">[<span class="hljs-string">'ls'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'-l'</span>]</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>It is the recommended standard way. However, more complicated tasks (pipes, output, input, etc.) can be tedious to construct and write.</p>

<p><em>Note on Python version: If you are still using Python 2, <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.call" rel="noreferrer">subprocess.call</a> works in a similar way.</em></p>

<p><em>ProTip: <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/shlex.html#shlex.split" rel="noreferrer">shlex.split</a> can help you to parse the command for <code>run</code>, <code>call</code>, and other <code>subprocess</code> functions in case you don't want (or you can't!) provide them in form of lists:</em></p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-haskell"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> shlex
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> subprocess
<span class="hljs-title">subprocess</span>.run(shlex.split('ls -l'))
</code></pre>

<h3>With external dependencies</h3>

<p>If you do not mind external dependencies, use <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plumbum" rel="noreferrer">plumbum</a>:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-coffeescript"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> plumbum.cmd <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> ifconfig
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(ifconfig[<span class="hljs-string">'wlan0'</span>]())
</code></pre>

<p>It is the best <code>subprocess</code> wrapper. It's cross-platform, i.e. it works on both Windows and Unix-like systems. Install by <code>pip install plumbum</code>.</p>

<p>Another popular library is <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sh" rel="noreferrer">sh</a>:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-coffeescript"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> sh <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> ifconfig
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(ifconfig(<span class="hljs-string">'wlan0'</span>))
</code></pre>

<p>However, <code>sh</code> dropped Windows support, so it's not as awesome as it used to be. Install by <code>pip install sh</code>.</p>

However, note that Python itself offers implementations of many shell-like features (in particular, <code>glob</code>, <code>fnmatch</code>, <code>os.walk()</code>, <code>os.path.expandvars()</code>, <code>os.path.expanduser()</code>, and <code>shutil</code>).</p>

<h1>Update:</h1>

<p><code>subprocess.run</code> is the recommended approach <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/whatsnew/3.5.html#whatsnew-subprocess" rel="noreferrer">as of Python 3.5</a> if your code does not need to maintain compatibility with earlier Python versions.

<h1>Original answer:</h1>

<p>I recommend trying <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/envoy" rel="noreferrer">Envoy</a>. It's a wrapper for subprocess, which in turn <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html" rel="noreferrer">aims to replace</a> the older modules and functions. Envoy is subprocess for humans.</p>

<p>Example usage from <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/envoy#readme" rel="noreferrer">the README</a>:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>r = envoy.run(<span class="hljs-string">'git config'</span>, data=<span class="hljs-string">'data to pipe in'</span>, timeout=<span class="hljs-number">2</span>)

<span class="hljs-string">''</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Pipe stuff around too:</p>

<h2>How to execute a program or call a system command from Python</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>Simple, use <code>subprocess.run</code>, which returns a <code>CompletedProcess</code> object:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> subprocess <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> run
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> shlex <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> split
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>completed_process = run(split(<span class="hljs-string">'python --version'</span>))
Python <span class="hljs-number">3.8</span><span class="hljs-number">.8</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>completed_process
CompletedProcess(args=[<span class="hljs-string">'python'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'--version'</span>], returncode=<span class="hljs-number">0</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>(<code>run</code> wants a list of lexically parsed shell arguments - this is what you'd type in a shell, separated by spaces, but not where the spaces are quoted, so use a specialized function, <code>split</code>, to split up what you would literally type into your shell)</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>As of Python 3.5, the documentation recommends <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run" rel="noreferrer">subprocess.run</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The recommended approach to invoking subprocesses is to use the run() function for all use cases it can handle. For more advanced use cases, the underlying Popen interface can be used directly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's an example of the simplest possible usage - and it does exactly as asked:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> subprocess <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> run
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> shlex <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> split
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>completed_process = run(split(<span class="hljs-string">'python --version'</span>))
Python <span class="hljs-number">3.8</span><span class="hljs-number">.8</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>completed_process
CompletedProcess(args=[<span class="hljs-string">'python'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'--version'</span>], returncode=<span class="hljs-number">0</span>)
</code></pre>
<p><code>run</code> waits for the command to successfully finish, then returns a <code>CompletedProcess</code> object. It may instead raise <code>TimeoutExpired</code> (if you give it a <code>timeout=</code> argument) or <code>CalledProcessError</code> (if it fails and you pass <code>check=True</code>).</p>
<p>As you might infer from the above example, stdout and stderr both get piped to your own stdout and stderr by default.</p>
<p>We can inspect the returned object and see the command that was given and the returncode:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>completed_process.args
[<span class="hljs-string">'python'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'--version'</span>]
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>completed_process.returncode
<span class="hljs-number">0</span>
</code></pre>
<h3>Capturing output</h3>
<p>If you want to capture the output, you can pass <code>subprocess.PIPE</code> to the appropriate <code>stderr</code> or <code>stdout</code>:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> subprocess <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> PIPE
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>completed_process = run(shlex.split(<span class="hljs-string">'python --version'</span>), stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>completed_process.stdout
<span class="hljs-string">b'Python 3.8.8\n'</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>completed_process.stderr
<span class="hljs-string">b''</span>
</code></pre>
<p>And those respective attributes return bytes.</p>
<h2>Pass a command list</h2>
<p>One might easily move from manually providing a command string (like the question suggests) to providing a string built programmatically. <strong>Don't build strings programmatically.</strong> This is a potential security issue. It's better to assume you don't trust the input.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> textwrap
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>args = [<span class="hljs-string">'python'</span>, textwrap.__file__]
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>cp = run(args, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>cp.stdout
<span class="hljs-string">b'Hello there.\n  This is indented.\n'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Note, only <code>args</code> should be passed positionally.</p>
<h2>Full Signature</h2>
<p>Here's the actual signature in the source and as shown by <code>help(run)</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">run</span>(<span class="hljs-params">*popenargs, <span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>=<span class="hljs-literal">None</span>, timeout=<span class="hljs-literal">None</span>, check=<span class="hljs-literal">False</span>, **kwargs</span>):
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>popenargs</code> and <code>kwargs</code> are given to the <code>Popen</code> constructor. <code>input</code> can be a string of bytes (or unicode, if specify encoding or <code>universal_newlines=True</code>) that will be piped to the subprocess's stdin.</p>
<p>The documentation describes <code>timeout=</code> and <code>check=True</code> better than I could:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The timeout argument is passed to Popen.communicate(). If the timeout
expires, the child process will be killed and waited for. The
TimeoutExpired exception will be re-raised after the child process has
terminated.</p>
<p>If check is true, and the process exits with a non-zero exit code, a
CalledProcessError exception will be raised. Attributes of that
exception hold the arguments, the exit code, and stdout and stderr if
they were captured.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and this example for <code>check=True</code> is better than one I could come up with:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="hljs-operator">&gt;</span> subprocess.run("exit 1", shell<span class="hljs-operator">=</span><span class="hljs-literal">True</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">check</span><span class="hljs-operator">=</span><span class="hljs-literal">True</span>)

<p>When use <code>Popen</code> instead? I would struggle to find use-case based on the arguments alone. Direct usage of <code>Popen</code> would, however, give you access to its methods, including <code>poll</code>, 'send_signal', 'terminate', and 'wait'.</p>
<p>Here's the <code>Popen</code> signature as given in <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/subprocess.py#L752" rel="noreferrer">the source</a>. I think this is the most precise encapsulation of the information (as opposed to <code>help(Popen)</code>):</p>

<hr>
<h1>TL;DR in 2021</h1>
<p>The big advantage of <code>os.system(...)</code> was its simplicity. <code>subprocess</code> is better and still easy to use, especially as of <strong>Python 3.5</strong>.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> subprocess
subprocess.run(<span class="hljs-string">"ls -a"</span>, shell=<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>)
</code></pre>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> This is the exact answer to your question - running a command</p>
<blockquote>
<p>like in a shell</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3>Preferred Way</h3>
<p>If possible, remove the shell overhead and run the command directly (requires a list).</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css">import subprocess
subprocess<span class="hljs-selector-class">.run</span>(<span class="hljs-selector-attr">[<span class="hljs-string">"help"</span>]</span>)
subprocess<span class="hljs-selector-class">.run</span>(<span class="hljs-selector-attr">[<span class="hljs-string">"ls"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"-a"</span>]</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Pass program arguments in a list. <strong>Don't include <code>\"</code>-escaping for arguments containing spaces.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h1>Advanced Use Cases</h1>
<h2>Checking The Output</h2>
<p>The following code speaks for itself:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> subprocess
result = subprocess.run([<span class="hljs-string">"ls"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"-a"</span>], capture_output=<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>, text=<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-string">"stackoverflow-logo.png"</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> result.stdout:
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"You're a fan!"</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"You're not a fan?"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p><code>result.stdout</code> is all normal program output <strong>excluding errors</strong>. Read <code>result.stderr</code> to get them.</p>
<p><code>capture_output=True</code> - turns capturing on. Otherwise <code>result.stderr</code> and <code>result.stdout</code> would be <code>None</code>. Available from <em>Python 3.7</em>.</p>
<p><code>text=True</code> - a convenience argument added in <em>Python 3.7</em> which converts the received binary data to Python strings you can easily work with.</p>
<h2>Checking the returncode</h2>
<p>Do</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> result.returncode == 127: <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"The program failed for some weird reason"</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">elif</span> result.returncode == 0: <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"The program succeeded"</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>: <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"The program failed unexpectedly"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>If you just want to check if the program succeeded (returncode == 0) and otherwise throw an Exception, there is a more convenient function:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-scss">result<span class="hljs-selector-class">.check_returncode</span>()
</code></pre>
<p>But it's Python, so there's an even more convenient argument <code>check</code> which does the same thing automatically for you:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">result</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> subprocess.run(..., <span class="hljs-keyword">check</span><span class="hljs-operator">=</span><span class="hljs-literal">True</span>)
</code></pre>
<h2>stderr should be inside stdout</h2>
<p>You might want to have all program output inside stdout, even errors. To accomplish this, run</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-ini"><span class="hljs-attr">result</span> = subprocess.run(..., stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
</code></pre>
<p><code>result.stderr</code> will then be <code>None</code> and <code>result.stdout</code> will contain everything.</p>
<h2>Using shell=False with an argument string</h2>
<p><code>shell=False</code> expects a <strong>list</strong> of arguments. You might however, split an argument string on your own using shlex.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-haskell"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> subprocess
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> shlex
<span class="hljs-title">subprocess</span>.run(shlex.split(<span class="hljs-string">"ls -a"</span>))
</code></pre>
<p>That's it.</p>
<h1>Common Problems</h1>
<p>Chances are high you just started using Python when you come across this question. Let's look at some common problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'ls -a': 'ls -a'</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>You're running a subprocess without <code>shell=True</code> . Either use a list (<code>["ls", "-a"]</code>) or set <code>shell=True</code>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>TypeError: [...] NoneType [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Check that you've set <code>capture_output=True</code>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>You always receive byte results from your program. If you want to work with it like a normal string, set <code>text=True</code>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '[...]' returned non-zero exit status 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Your command didn't run successfully. You could disable returncode checking or check your actual program's validity.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>TypeError: <strong>init</strong>() got an unexpected keyword argument [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>You're likely using a version of Python older than 3.7.0; update it to the most recent one available. Otherwise there are other answers in this Stack Overflow post showing you older alternative solutions.</em></p>

<p>There is another difference here which is not mentioned previously.</p>

<p><code>subprocess.Popen</code> executes the &lt;command&gt; as a subprocess. In my case, I need to execute file &lt;a&gt; which needs to communicate with another program, &lt;b&gt;. </p>

<p>I tried subprocess, and execution was successful. However &lt;b&gt; could not communicate with &lt;a&gt;.
Everything is normal when I run both from the terminal.</p>

<p>One more: 
(NOTE: kwrite behaves different from other applications. If you try the below with Firefox, the results will not be the same.)</p>

<p>If you try <code>os.system("kwrite")</code>, program flow freezes until the user closes kwrite. To overcome that I tried instead <code>os.system(konsole -e kwrite)</code>. This time program continued to flow, but kwrite became the subprocess of the console.</p>

<p>Anyone runs the kwrite not being a subprocess (i.e. in the system monitor it must appear at the leftmost edge of the tree).</p>

<p>Under Linux, in case you would like to call an external command that will execute independently (will keep running after the Python script terminates), you can use a simple queue as <a href="http://vicerveza.homeunix.net/%7Eviric/soft/ts/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">task spooler</a> or the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/at" rel="nofollow noreferrer">at</a> command.</p>
<p>An example with task spooler:</p>

<p>Notes about task spooler (<code>ts</code>):</p>
<ol>
<li><p>You could set the number of concurrent processes to be run ("slots") with:</p>
<p><code>ts -S &lt;number-of-slots&gt;</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Installing <code>ts</code> doesn't requires admin privileges. You can download and compile it from source with a simple <code>make</code>, add it to your path and you're done.</p>
