In C, A a() is function declaration. For example, putchar has the following declaration. Normally, such declarations are stored in header files, however nothing stops you from writing them manually, if you know how the declaration of function looks like. The argument names are optional in declarations, so I omitted it in this example.\n\nint putchar(int);\n\n\nThis allows you to write the code like this.\n\nint puts(const char *);\nint main() {\n    puts(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);\n}\n\n\nC also allows you to define functions that take functions as arguments, with nice readable syntax that looks like a function call (well, it&apos;s readable, as long you won&apos;t return a pointer to function).\n\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint eighty_four() {\n    return 84;\n}\n\nint output_result(int callback()) {\n    printf(&quot;Returned: %d\\n&quot;, callback());\n    return 0;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    return output_result(eighty_four);\n}\n\n\nAs I mentioned, C allows omitting argument names in header files, therefore the output_result would look like this in header file.\n\nint output_result(int());\n\n\nOne argument in constructor\n\nDon&apos;t you recognize that one? Well, let me remind you.\n\nA a(B());\n\n\nYep, it&apos;s exactly the same function declaration. A is int, a is output_result, and B is int.\n\nYou can easily notice a conflict of C with new features of C++. To be exact, constructors being class name and parenthesis, and alternate declaration syntax with () instead of =. By design, C++ tries to be compatible with C code, and therefore it has to deal with this case - even if practically nobody cares. Therefore, old C features have priority over new C++ features. The grammar of declarations tries to match the name as function, before reverting to the new syntax with () if it fails.\n\nIf one of those features wouldn&apos;t exist, or had a different syntax (like {} in C++11), this issue would never have happened for syntax with one argument.\n\nNow you may ask why A a((B())) works. Well, let&apos;s declare output_result with useless parentheses.\n\nint output_result((int()));\n\n\nIt won&apos;t work. The grammar requires the variable to not be in parentheses.\n\n&lt;stdin&gt;:1:19: error: expected declaration specifiers or ... before ( token\n\n\nHowever, C++ expects standard expression here. In C++, you can write the following code.\n\nint value = int();\n\n\nAnd the following code.\n\nint value = ((((int()))));\n\n\nC++ expects expression inside inside parentheses to be... well... expression, as opposed to the type C expects. Parentheses don&apos;t mean anything here. However, by inserting useless parentheses, the C function declaration is not matched, and the new syntax can be matched properly (which simply expects an expression, such as 2 + 2).\n\nMore arguments in constructor\n\nSurely one argument is nice, but what about two? It&apos;s not that constructors may have just one argument. One of built-in classes which takes two arguments is std::string\n\nstd::string hundred_dots(100, &apos;.&apos;);\n\n\nThis is all well and fine (technically, it would have most vexing parse if it would be written as std::string wat(int(), char()), but let&apos;s be honest - who would write that? But let&apos;s assume this code has a vexing problem. You would assume that you have to put everything in parentheses.\n\nstd::string hundred_dots((100, &apos;.&apos;));\n\n\nNot quite so.\n\n&lt;stdin&gt;:2:36: error: invalid conversion from char to const char* [-fpermissive]\nIn file included from /usr/include/c++/4.8/string:53:0,\n                 from &lt;stdin&gt;:1:\n/usr/include/c++/4.8/bits/basic_string.tcc:212:5: error:   initializing argument 1 of std::basic_string&lt;_CharT, _Traits, _Alloc&gt;::basic_string(const _CharT*, const _Alloc&amp;) [with _CharT = char; _Traits = std::char_traits&lt;char&gt;; _Alloc = std::allocator&lt;char&gt;] [-fpermissive]\n     basic_string&lt;_CharT, _Traits, _Alloc&gt;::\n     ^\n\n\nI&apos;m not sure why g++ tries to convert char to const char *. Either way, the constructor was called with just one value of type char. There is no overload which has one argument of type char, therefore the compiler is confused. You may ask - why the argument is of type char?\n\n(100, &apos;.&apos;)\n\n\nYes, , here is a comma operator. The comma operator takes two arguments, and gives the right-side argument. It isn&apos;t really useful, but it&apos;s something to be known for my explanation.\n\nInstead, to solve the most vexing parse, the following code is needed.\n\nstd::string hundred_dots((100), (&apos;.&apos;));\n\n\nThe arguments are in parentheses, not the entire expression. In fact, just one of expressions needs to be in parentheses, as it&apos;s enough to break from the C grammar slightly to use the C++ feature. Things brings us to the point of zero arguments.\n\nZero arguments in constructor\n\nYou may have noticed the eighty_four function in my explanation.\n\nint eighty_four();\n\n\nYes, this is also affected by the most vexing parse. It&apos;s a valid definition, and one you most likely have seen if you created header files (and you should). Adding parentheses doesn&apos;t fix it.\n\nint eighty_four(());\n\n\nWhy is that so? Well, () is not an expression. In C++, you have to put an expression between parentheses. You cannot write auto value = () in C++, because () doesn&apos;t mean anything (and even if did, like empty tuple (see Python), it would be one argument, not zero). Practically that means you cannot use shorthand syntax without using C++11&apos;s {} syntax, as there are no expressions to put in parenthesis, and C grammar for function declarations will always apply.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You could instead\n\nA a(());\n\n\nuse\n\nA a=A();\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"The innermost parens in your example would be an expression, and in C++ the grammar defines an expression to be an assignment-expression or another expression followed by a comma and another assignment-expression (Appendix A.4 - Grammar summary/Expressions).\n\nThe grammar further defines an assignment-expression as one of several other types of expression, none of which can be nothing (or only whitespace).\n\nSo the reason you can&apos;t have A a(()) is simply because the grammar doesn&apos;t allow it.  However, I can&apos;t answer why the people who created C++ didn&apos;t allow this particular use of empty parens as some sort of special-case - I&apos;d guess that they&apos;d rather not put in such a special case if there was a reasonable alternative.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0}],"@type":"Question"}}</script><meta name="next-head-count"

<p>While this, for most, intuitively appears to be the declaration of an object <code>a</code> of type <code>A</code>, taking a temporary <code>B</code> object as a constructor parameter, it's actually a declaration of a function <code>a</code> returning an <code>A</code>, taking a pointer to a function which returns <code>B</code> and itself takes no parameters.

<h1>C function declarators</h1>

<p>First of all, there is C. In C, <code>A a()</code> is function declaration. For example, <code>putchar</code> has the following declaration. Normally, such declarations are stored in header files, however nothing stops you from writing them manually, if you know how the declaration of function looks like. The argument names are optional in declarations, so I omitted it in this example.</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-title">putchar</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-type">int</span>)</span></span>;
</code></pre>

<p>This allows you to write the code like this.</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-title">puts</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-type">const</span> <span class="hljs-type">char</span> *)</span></span>;
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-title">main</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-built_in">puts</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Hello, world!"</span>);
}
</code></pre>

<p>C also allows you to define functions that take functions as arguments, with nice readable syntax that looks like a function call (well, it's readable, as long you won't return a pointer to function).</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-keyword">include</span> <span class="hljs-string">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></span>

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-title">eighty_four</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-number">84</span>;
}

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-title">output_result</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-type">int</span> callback())</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-built_in">printf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Returned: %d\n"</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">callback</span>());
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
}

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-title">main</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">output_result</span>(eighty_four);
}
</code></pre>

<p>As I mentioned, C allows omitting argument names in header files, therefore the <code>output_result</code> would look like this in header file.</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-title">output_result</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-type">int</span>())</span></span>;
</code></pre>

<h1>One argument in constructor</h1>

<p>Don't you recognize that one? Well, let me remind you.</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-function">A <span class="hljs-title">a</span><span class="hljs-params">(B())</span></span>;
</code></pre>

<p>Yep, it's exactly the same function declaration. <code>A</code> is <code>int</code>, <code>a</code> is <code>output_result</code>, and <code>B</code> is <code>int</code>.</p>

<p>You can easily notice a conflict of C with new features of C++. To be exact, constructors being class name and parenthesis, and alternate declaration syntax with <code>()</code> instead of <code>=</code>. By design, C++ tries to be compatible with C code, and therefore it has to deal with this case - even if practically nobody cares. Therefore, old C features have priority over new C++ features. The grammar of declarations tries to match the name as function, before reverting to the new syntax with <code>()</code> if it fails.</p>

<p>If one of those features wouldn't exist, or had a different syntax (like <code>{}</code> in C++11), this issue would never have happened for syntax with one argument.</p>

<p>Now you may ask why <code>A a((B()))</code> works. Well, let's declare <code>output_result</code> with useless parentheses.</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-title">output_result</span><span class="hljs-params">((<span class="hljs-type">int</span>()))</span></span>;
</code></pre>

<p>It won't work. The grammar requires the variable to not be in parentheses.</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp">&lt;stdin&gt;:<span class="hljs-number">1</span>:<span class="hljs-number">19</span>: error: expected declaration specifiers <span class="hljs-keyword">or</span> ... before ( token
</code></pre>

<p>However, C++ expects standard expression here. In C++, you can write the following code.</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> value = <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>();
</code></pre>

<p>And the following code.</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> value = ((((<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>()))));
</code></pre>

<p>C++ expects expression inside inside parentheses to be... well... expression, as opposed to the type C expects. Parentheses don't mean anything here. However, by inserting useless parentheses, the C function declaration is not matched, and the new syntax can be matched properly (which simply expects an expression, such as <code>2 + 2</code>).</p>

<h1>More arguments in constructor</h1>

<p>Surely one argument is nice, but what about two? It's not that constructors may have just one argument. One of built-in classes which takes two arguments is <code>std::string</code></p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-function">std::string <span class="hljs-title">hundred_dots</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-number">100</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'.'</span>)</span></span>;
</code></pre>

<p>This is all well and fine (technically, it would have most vexing parse if it would be written as <code>std::string wat(int(), char())</code>, but let's be honest - who would write that? But let's assume this code has a vexing problem. You would assume that you have to put everything in parentheses.</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-function">std::string <span class="hljs-title">hundred_dots</span><span class="hljs-params">((<span class="hljs-number">100</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'.'</span>))</span></span>;
</code></pre>

<p>Not quite so.</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp">&lt;stdin&gt;:<span class="hljs-number">2</span>:<span class="hljs-number">36</span>: error: invalid conversion from <span class="hljs-type">char</span> to <span class="hljs-type">const</span> <span class="hljs-type">char</span>* [-fpermissive]

     basic_string&lt;_CharT, _Traits, _Alloc&gt;::
     ^
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure why g++ tries to convert <code>char</code> to <code>const char *</code>. Either way, the constructor was called with just one value of type <code>char</code>. There is no overload which has one argument of type <code>char</code>, therefore the compiler is confused. You may ask - why the argument is of type char?</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp">(<span class="hljs-number">100</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'.'</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, <code>,</code> here is a comma operator. The comma operator takes two arguments, and gives the right-side argument. It isn't really useful, but it's something to be known for my explanation.</p>

<p>Instead, to solve the most vexing parse, the following code is needed.</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-function">std::string <span class="hljs-title">hundred_dots</span><span class="hljs-params">((<span class="hljs-number">100</span>), (<span class="hljs-string">'.'</span>))</span></span>;
</code></pre>

<p>The arguments are in parentheses, not the entire expression. In fact, just one of expressions needs to be in parentheses, as it's enough to break from the C grammar slightly to use the C++ feature. Things brings us to the point of zero arguments.</p>

<h1>Zero arguments in constructor</h1>

<p>You may have noticed the <code>eighty_four</code> function in my explanation.</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-title">eighty_four</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>;
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, this is also affected by the most vexing parse. It's a valid definition, and one you most likely have seen if you created header files (and you should). Adding parentheses doesn't fix it.</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-title">eighty_four</span><span class="hljs-params">(())</span></span>;
</code></pre>

<p>Why is that so? Well, <code>()</code> is not an expression. In C++, you have to put an expression between parentheses. You cannot write <code>auto value = ()</code> in C++, because <code>()</code> doesn't mean anything (and even if did, like empty tuple (see Python), it would be one argument, not zero). Practically that means you cannot use shorthand syntax without using C++11's <code>{}</code> syntax, as there are no expressions to put in parenthesis, and C grammar for function declarations will always apply.</p>

<p>The innermost parens in your example would be an expression, and in C++ the grammar defines an <code>expression</code> to be an <code>assignment-expression</code> or another <code>expression</code> followed by a comma and another <code>assignment-expression</code> (Appendix A.4 - Grammar summary/Expressions).</p>

<p>The grammar further defines an <code>assignment-expression</code> as one of several other types of expression, none of which can be nothing (or only whitespace).</p>

<p>So the reason you can't have <code>A a(())</code> is simply because the grammar doesn't allow it.  However, I can't answer why the people who created C++ didn't allow this particular use of empty parens as some sort of special-case - I'd guess that they'd rather not put in such a special case if there was a reasonable alternative.</p>
