I&#x27;ve been using the == operator in my program to compare all my strings so far.
However, I ran into a bug, changed one of them into .equals() instead, and it fixed the bug.

Is == bad? When should it and should it not be used? What&#x27;s the difference?

That means whenever you try to change/modify the string you get a new instance. You cannot change the original string. This has been done so that these string instances can be cached. A typical program contains a lot of string references and caching these instances can decrease the memory footprint and increase the performance of the program.\n\nWhen using == operator for string comparison you are not comparing the contents of the string, but are actually comparing the memory address. If they are both equal it will return true and false otherwise. Whereas equals in string compares the string contents.\n\nSo the question is if all the strings are cached in the system, how come == returns false whereas equals return true? Well, this is possible. If you make a new string like String str = new String(&quot;Testing&quot;) you end up creating a new string in the cache even if the cache already contains a string having the same content. In short &quot;MyString&quot; == new String(&quot;MyString&quot;) will always return false.\n\nJava also talks about the function intern() that can be used on a string to make it part of the cache so &quot;MyString&quot; == new String(&quot;MyString&quot;).intern() will return true.\n\nNote: == operator is much faster than equals just because you are comparing two memory addresses, but you need to be sure that the code isn&apos;t creating new String instances in the code.

At the end of this Java String comparison tutorial I&apos;ll also discuss why the &quot;==&quot; operator doesn&apos;t work when comparing Java strings.\n\nOption 1: Java String comparison with the equals method\nMost of the time (maybe 95% of the time) I compare strings with the equals method of the Java String class, like this:\n\nif (string1.equals(string2))\n\n\nThis String equals method looks at the two Java strings, and if they contain the exact same string of characters, they are considered equal.\n\nTaking a look at a quick String comparison example with the equals method, if the following test were run, the two strings would not be considered equal because the characters are not the exactly the same (the case of the characters is different):\n\nString string1 = &quot;foo&quot;;\nString string2 = &quot;FOO&quot;;\n\nif (string1.equals(string2))\n{\n    // this line will not print because the\n    // java string equals method returns false:\n    System.out.println(&quot;The two strings are the same.&quot;)\n}\n\n\nBut, when the two strings contain the exact same string of characters, the equals method will return true, as in this example:\n\nString string1 = &quot;foo&quot;;\nString string2 = &quot;foo&quot;;\n\n// test for equality with the java string equals method\nif (string1.equals(string2))\n{\n    // this line WILL print\n    System.out.println(&quot;The two strings are the same.&quot;)\n}\n\n\nOption 2: String comparison with the equalsIgnoreCase method\n\nIn some string comparison tests you&apos;ll want to ignore whether the strings are uppercase or lowercase. When you want to test your strings for equality in this case-insensitive manner, use the equalsIgnoreCase method of the String class, like this:\n\nString string1 = &quot;foo&quot;;\nString string2 = &quot;FOO&quot;;\n\n // java string compare while ignoring case\n if (string1.equalsIgnoreCase(string2))\n {\n     // this line WILL print\n     System.out.println(&quot;Ignoring case, the two strings are the same.&quot;)\n }\n\n\nOption 3: Java String comparison with the compareTo method\n\nThere is also a third, less common way to compare Java strings, and that&apos;s with the String class compareTo method. If the two strings are exactly the same, the compareTo method will return a value of 0 (zero). Here&apos;s a quick example of what this String comparison approach looks like:\n\nString string1 = &quot;foo bar&quot;;\nString string2 = &quot;foo bar&quot;;\n\n// java string compare example\nif (string1.compareTo(string2) == 0)\n{\n    // this line WILL print\n    System.out.println(&quot;The two strings are the same.&quot;)\n}\n\n\nWhile I&apos;m writing about this concept of equality in Java, it&apos;s important to note that the Java language includes an equals method in the base Java Object class. Whenever you&apos;re creating your own objects and you want to provide a means to see if two instances of your object are &quot;equal&quot;, you should override (and implement) this equals method in your class (in the same way the Java language provides this equality/comparison behavior in the String equals method).\n\nYou may want to have a look at this ==, .equals(), compareTo(), and compare()\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution14","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Function:\n\npublic float simpleSimilarity(String u, String v) {\n    String[] a = u.split(&quot; &quot;);\n    String[] b = v.split(&quot; &quot;);\n\n    long correct = 0;\n    int minLen = Math.min(a.length, b.length);\n\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; minLen; i++) {\n        String aa = a[i];\n        String bb = b[i];\n        int minWordLength = Math.min(aa.length(), bb.length());\n\n        for (int j = 0; j &lt; minWordLength; j++) {\n            if (aa.charAt(j) == bb.charAt(j)) {\n                correct++;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return (float) (((double) correct) / Math.max(u.length(), v.length()));\n}\n\n\nTest:\n\nString a = &quot;This is the first string.&quot;;\n\nString b = &quot;this is not 1st string!&quot;;\n\n// for exact string comparison, use .equals\n\nboolean exact = a.equals(b);\n\n// For similarity check, there are libraries for this\n// Here I&apos;ll try a simple example I wrote\n\nfloat similarity = simple_similarity(a,b);\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution15","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"The == operator check if the two references point to the same object or not. .equals() check for the actual string content (value).\n\nNote that the .equals() method belongs to class Object (super class of all classes).

<p>I've been using the <code>==</code> operator in my program to compare all my strings so far.
However, I ran into a bug, changed one of them into <code>.equals()</code> instead, and it fixed the bug.</p>

<p>Is <code>==</code> bad? When should it and should it not be used? What's the difference?</p>

<p>You almost <strong>always</strong> want to use <code>Objects.equals()</code>. In the <strong>rare</strong> situation where you <strong>know</strong> you're dealing with <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#intern--" rel="noreferrer">interned</a> strings, you <em>can</em> use <code>==</code>.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.10.5" rel="noreferrer">JLS 3.10.5. <em>String Literals</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Moreover, a string literal always refers to the <em>same</em> instance of class <code>String</code>. This is because string literals - or, more generally, strings that are the values of constant expressions (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.28" rel="noreferrer">§15.28</a>) - are "interned" so as to share unique instances, using the method <code>String.intern</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar examples can also be found in <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-3.html#d5e1634" rel="noreferrer">JLS 3.10.5-1</a>.</p>
<h3>Other Methods To Consider</h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#equalsIgnoreCase-java.lang.String-" rel="noreferrer">String.equalsIgnoreCase()</a> value equality that ignores case. Beware, however, that this method can have unexpected results in various locale-related cases, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44238749/equalsignorecase-not-working-as-intended">this question</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#contentEquals-java.lang.CharSequence-" rel="noreferrer">String.contentEquals()</a> compares the content of the <code>String</code> with the content of any <code>CharSequence</code> (available since Java 1.5). Saves you from having to turn your StringBuffer, etc into a String before doing the equality comparison, but leaves the null checking to you.</p>

<p><code>==</code> tests object references, <code>.equals()</code> tests the string values.  </p>

<p>Sometimes it looks as if <code>==</code> compares values, because Java does some behind-the-scenes stuff to make sure identical in-line strings are actually the same object.</p>

<p>For example:  </p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">fooString1</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>);
<span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">fooString2</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>);

<span class="hljs-comment">// Evaluates to false</span>
fooString1 == fooString2;

<span class="hljs-comment">// Evaluates to true</span>
fooString1.equals(fooString2);

<span class="hljs-comment">// Evaluates to true, because Java uses the same object</span>
<span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span> == <span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span>;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>But beware of nulls!</strong>  </p>

<p><code>==</code> handles <code>null</code> strings fine, but calling <code>.equals()</code> from a null string will cause an exception:  </p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">nullString1</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>;
<span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">nullString2</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>;

<span class="hljs-comment">// Evaluates to true</span>
System.out.print(nullString1 == nullString2);

<span class="hljs-comment">// Throws a NullPointerException</span>
System.out.print(nullString1.equals(nullString2));
</code></pre>

<p>So if you know that <code>fooString1</code> may be null, tell the reader that by writing</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">System.out.print(fooString1 != <span class="hljs-literal">null</span> &amp;&amp; fooString1.equals(<span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span>));
</code></pre>

<p>The following are shorter, but its less obvious that it checks for null:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">System.out.print(<span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span>.equals(fooString1));  <span class="hljs-comment">// "bar" is never null</span>
System.out.print(Objects.equals(fooString1, <span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span>));  <span class="hljs-comment">// Java 7 required</span>

<p><code>==</code> compares Object references.</p>

<p><code>.equals()</code> compares String values.</p>

<p>Sometimes <code>==</code> gives illusions of comparing String values, as in following cases:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">String a=<span class="hljs-string">"Test"</span>;
String b=<span class="hljs-string">"Test"</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(a==b) ===&gt; <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This is because when you create any String literal, the JVM first searches for that literal in the String pool, and if it finds a match, that same reference will be given to the new String. Because of this, we get:</p>

<p><strong>(a==b) ===&gt; true</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">                       String Pool
     b -----------------&gt; <span class="hljs-string">"test"</span> &lt;-----------------a
</code></pre>

<p>However, <code>==</code> fails in the following case:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">String a=<span class="hljs-string">"test"</span>;
String b=<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"test"</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (a==b) ===&gt; <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In this case for <code>new String("test")</code> the statement new String will be created on the heap, and that reference will be given to <code>b</code>, so <code>b</code> will be given a reference on the heap, not in String pool.</p>

<p>Now <code>a</code> is pointing to a String in the String pool while <code>b</code> is pointing to a String on the heap. Because of that we get:</p>

<p><strong>if(a==b) ===&gt; false.</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">                String Pool
     <span class="hljs-string">"test"</span> &lt;-------------------- a

                   Heap
     <span class="hljs-string">"test"</span> &lt;-------------------- b
</code></pre>

<p>While <code>.equals()</code> always compares a value of String so it gives true in both cases:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">String a=<span class="hljs-string">"Test"</span>;
String b=<span class="hljs-string">"Test"</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(a.equals(b)) ===&gt; <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>

String a=<span class="hljs-string">"test"</span>;
String b=<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"test"</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(a.equals(b)) ===&gt; <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>

<p>Strings in Java are immutable. That means whenever you try to change/modify the string you get a new instance. You cannot change the original string. This has been done so that these string instances can be cached. A typical program contains a lot of string references and caching these instances can decrease the memory footprint and increase the performance of the program.</p>

<p>When using == operator for string comparison you are not comparing the contents of the string, but are actually comparing the memory address. If they are both equal it will return true and false otherwise. Whereas equals in string compares the string contents.</p>

<p>So the question is if all the strings are cached in the system, how come <code>==</code> returns false whereas equals return true? Well, this is possible. If you make a new string like <code>String str = new String("Testing")</code> you end up creating a new string in the cache even if the cache already contains a string having the same content. In short <code>"MyString" == new String("MyString")</code> will always return false.</p>

<p>Java also talks about the function intern() that can be used on a string to make it part of the cache so <code>"MyString" == new String("MyString").intern()</code> will return true.</p>

<p>Note: == operator is much faster than equals just because you are comparing two memory addresses, but you need to be sure that the code isn't creating new String instances in the code. Otherwise you will encounter bugs.</p>

<p>Yea, it's bad...</p>

<p><code>==</code> means that your two string references are exactly the same object. You may have heard that this is the case because Java keeps sort of a literal table (which it does), but that is not always the case.

<p>Yes, <code>==</code> is bad for comparing Strings (any objects really, unless you know they're canonical).  <code>==</code> just compares object references.  <code>.equals()</code> tests for equality.

<p>Java have a String pool under which Java manages the memory allocation for the String objects. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3801343/what-is-string-pool-in-java"><strong>String Pools in Java</strong></a></p>

<p>When you check (compare) two objects using the <code>==</code> operator it compares the address equality into the string-pool. If the two String objects have the same address references then it returns <code>true</code>, otherwise <code>false</code>. But if you want to compare the contents of two String objects then you must override the <code>equals</code> method.</p>

<p><code>equals</code> is actually the method of the Object class, but it is Overridden into the String class and a new definition is given which compares the contents of object.</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">Example:
    stringObjectOne.equals(stringObjectTwo);

<p>But mind it respects the case of String. If you want case insensitive compare then you must go for the equalsIgnoreCase method of the String class. </p>

<p><code>==</code> performs a <strong>reference</strong> equality check, whether the 2 objects (strings in this case) refer to the same object in the memory.</p>
<p>The <code>equals()</code> method will check whether the <strong>contents</strong> or the <strong>states</strong> of 2 objects are the same.</p>
<p>Obviously <code>==</code> is faster, but will (might) give false results in many cases if you just want to tell if 2 <code>String</code>s hold the same text.</p>
<p>Definitely the use of the <code>equals()</code> method is recommended.</p>
<p>Don't worry about the performance. Some things to encourage using <code>String.equals()</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implementation of <code>String.equals()</code> first checks for reference equality (using <code>==</code>), and if the 2 strings are the same by reference, no further calculation is performed!</li>
<li>If the 2 string references are not the same, <code>String.equals()</code> will next check the lengths of the strings. This is also a fast operation because the <code>String</code> class stores the length of the string, no need to count the characters or code points. If the lengths differ, no further check is performed, we know they cannot be equal.</li>
<li>Only if we got this far will the contents of the 2 strings be actually compared, and this will be a short-hand comparison: not all the characters will be compared, if we find a mismatching character (at the same position in the 2 strings), no further characters will be checked.</li>
</ol>
<p>When all is said and done, even if we have a guarantee that the strings are interns, using the <code>equals()</code> method is still not that overhead that one might think, definitely the recommended way. If you want an efficient reference check, then use enums where it is guaranteed by the language specification and implementation that the same enum value will be the same object (by reference).</p>

<p>If you're like me, when I first started using Java, I wanted to use the "==" operator to test whether two String instances were equal, but for better or worse, that's not the correct way to do it in Java.</p>

<p>In this tutorial I'll demonstrate several different ways to correctly compare Java strings, starting with the approach I use most of the time. At the end of this Java String comparison tutorial I'll also discuss why the "==" operator doesn't work when comparing Java strings.</p>

<p><strong>Option 1: Java String comparison with the equals method</strong>
Most of the time (maybe 95% of the time) I compare strings with the equals method of the Java String class, like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (string1.equals(string2))
</code></pre>

<p>This String equals method looks at the two Java strings, and if they contain the exact same string of characters, they are considered equal.</p>

<p>Taking a look at a quick String comparison example with the equals method, if the following test were run, the two strings would not be considered equal because the characters are not the exactly the same (the case of the characters is different):</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">string1</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>;
<span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">string2</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">"FOO"</span>;

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (string1.equals(string2))
{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// this line will not print because the</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// java string equals method returns false:</span>
    System.out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"The two strings are the same."</span>)
}
</code></pre>

<p>But, when the two strings contain the exact same string of characters, the equals method will return true, as in this example:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">string1</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>;
<span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">string2</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>;

<span class="hljs-comment">// test for equality with the java string equals method</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (string1.equals(string2))
{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// this line WILL print</span>
    System.out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"The two strings are the same."</span>)

<p><strong>Option 2: String comparison with the equalsIgnoreCase method</strong></p>

<p>In some string comparison tests you'll want to ignore whether the strings are uppercase or lowercase. When you want to test your strings for equality in this case-insensitive manner, use the equalsIgnoreCase method of the String class, like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">string1</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>;
<span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">string2</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">"FOO"</span>;

 {
     <span class="hljs-comment">// this line WILL print</span>
     System.out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"Ignoring case, the two strings are the same."</span>)
 }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Option 3: Java String comparison with the compareTo method</strong></p>

<p>There is also a third, less common way to compare Java strings, and that's with the String class compareTo method. If the two strings are exactly the same, the compareTo method will return a value of 0 (zero). Here's a quick example of what this String comparison approach looks like:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">string1</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">"foo bar"</span>;
<span class="hljs-type">String</span> <span class="hljs-variable">string2</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">"foo bar"</span>;

<span class="hljs-comment">// java string compare example</span>

{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// this line WILL print</span>
    System.out.println(<span class="hljs-string">"The two strings are the same."</span>)
}
</code></pre>

<p>While I'm writing about this concept of equality in Java, it's important to note that the Java language includes an equals method in the base Java Object class. Whenever you're creating your own objects and you want to provide a means to see if two instances of your object are "equal", you should override (and implement) this equals method in your class (in the same way the Java language provides this equality/comparison behavior in the String equals method).</p>

<p>If the <code>equals()</code> method is present in the <code>java.lang.Object</code> class, and it is expected to check for the equivalence of the state of objects! That means, the contents of the objects. Whereas the <code>==</code> operator is expected to check the actual object instances are same or not.</p>

<p><em>Example</em></p>

<p>Consider two different reference variables, <code>str1</code> and <code>str2</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">str1 = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"abc"</span>);
str2 = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"abc"</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>If you use the <code>equals()</code></p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">System.out.println((str1.equals(str2))?<span class="hljs-string">"TRUE"</span>:<span class="hljs-string">"FALSE"</span>);

</code></pre>

<p>Now you will get the <code>FALSE</code> as output, because both <code>str1</code> and <code>str2</code> are pointing to two different objects even though both of them share the same string content. It is because of <code>new String()</code> a new object is created every time.</p>

<p>All objects are guaranteed to have a <code>.equals()</code> method since Object contains a method, <code>.equals()</code>, that returns a boolean. It is the subclass' job to override this method if a further defining definition is required. Without it (i.e. using <code>==</code>) only memory addresses are checked between two objects for equality. String overrides this <code>.equals()</code> method and instead of using the memory address it returns the comparison of strings at the character level for equality. </p>

<p>A key note is that strings are stored in one lump pool so once a string is created it is forever stored in a program at the same address. Strings do not change, they are immutable. This is why it is a bad idea to use regular string concatenation if you have a serious of amount of string processing to do. Instead you would use the <code>StringBuilder</code> classes provided. Remember the pointers to this string can change and if you were interested to see if two pointers were the same <code>==</code> would be a fine way to go. Strings themselves do not.</p>

<p>In Java, when the <code>==</code> operator is used to compare 2 objects, it checks to see if the objects refer to the same place in memory. In other words, it checks to see if the 2 object names are basically references to the same memory location.</p>
<p>The Java <code>String</code> class actually overrides the default <code>equals()</code> implementation in the <code>Object</code> class  and it overrides the method so that it checks only the values of the strings, not their locations in memory.
