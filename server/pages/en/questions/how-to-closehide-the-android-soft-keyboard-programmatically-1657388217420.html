The reason there are so many answers, each different, for the same simple question is that this API, like many others in Android, is horribly designed. I can think of no polite way to state it.\nI want to hide the keyboard.  I expect to provide Android with the following statement: Keyboard.hide(). The end. Thank you very much.  But Android has a problem.  You must use the InputMethodManager to hide the keyboard. OK, fine, this is Android&apos;s API to the keyboard. BUT! You are required to have a Context in order to get access to the IMM. Now we have a problem.  I may want to hide the keyboard from a static or utility class that has no use or need for any Context. or And FAR worse, the IMM requires that you specify what View (or even worse, what Window) you want to hide the keyboard FROM.\nThis is what makes hiding the keyboard so challenging. Dear Google: When I&apos;m looking up the recipe for a cake, there is no RecipeProvider on Earth that would refuse to provide me with the recipe unless I first answer WHO the cake will be eaten by AND where it will be eaten!!\nThis sad story ends with the ugly truth: to hide the Android keyboard, you will be required to provide 2 forms of identification: a Context and either a View or a Window.\nI have created a static utility method that can do the job VERY solidly, provided you call it from an Activity.\npublic static void hideKeyboard(Activity activity) {\n    InputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager) activity.getSystemService(Activity.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);\n    //Find the currently focused view, so we can grab the correct window token from it.\n    View view = activity.getCurrentFocus();\n    //If no view currently has focus, create a new one, just so we can grab a window token from it\n    if (view == null) {\n        view = new View(activity);\n    }\n    imm.hideSoftInputFromWindow(view.getWindowToken(), 0);\n}\n\nBe aware that this utility method ONLY works when called from an Activity! The above method calls getCurrentFocus of the target Activity to fetch the proper window token.\nBut suppose you want to hide the keyboard from an EditText hosted in a DialogFragment? You can&apos;t use the method above for that:\nhideKeyboard(getActivity()); //won&apos;t work\n\nThis won&apos;t work because you&apos;ll be passing a reference to the Fragment&apos;s host Activity, which will have no focused control while the Fragment is shown! Wow! So, for hiding the keyboard from fragments, I resort to the lower-level, more common, and uglier:\npublic static void hideKeyboardFrom(Context context, View view) {\n    InputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager) context.getSystemService(Activity.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);\n    imm.hideSoftInputFromWindow(view.getWindowToken(), 0);\n}\n\nBelow is some additional information gleaned from more time wasted chasing this solution:\nAbout windowSoftInputMode\nThere&apos;s yet another point of contention to be aware of. By default, Android will automatically assign initial focus to the first EditText or focusable control in your Activity.  It naturally follows that the InputMethod (typically the soft keyboard) will respond to the focus event by showing itself. The windowSoftInputMode attribute in AndroidManifest.xml, when set to stateAlwaysHidden, instructs the keyboard to ignore this automatically-assigned initial focus.\n&lt;activity\n    android:name=&quot;.MyActivity&quot;\n    android:windowSoftInputMode=&quot;stateAlwaysHidden&quot;/&gt;\n\nAlmost unbelievably, it appears to do nothing to prevent the keyboard from opening when you touch the control (unless focusable=&quot;false&quot; and/or focusableInTouchMode=&quot;false&quot; are assigned to the control). Apparently, the windowSoftInputMode setting applies only to automatic focus events, not to focus events triggered by touch events.\nTherefore, stateAlwaysHidden is VERY poorly named indeed. It should perhaps be called ignoreInitialFocus instead.\n\nUPDATE: More ways to get a window token\nIf there is no focused view (e.g. can happen if you just changed fragments), there are other views that will supply a useful window token.\nThese are alternatives for the above code if (view == null)   view = new View(activity);  These don&apos;t refer explicitly to your activity.\nInside a fragment class:\nview = getView().getRootView().getWindowToken();\n\nGiven a fragment fragment as a parameter:\nview = fragment.getView().getRootView().getWindowToken();\n\nStarting from your content body:\nview = findViewById(android.R.id.content).getRootView().getWindowToken();\n\n\nUPDATE 2: Clear focus to avoid showing keyboard again if you open the app from the background\nAdd this line to the end of the method:\nview.clearFocus();\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Also useful for hiding the soft-keyboard is:\n\ngetWindow().setSoftInputMode(\n    WindowManager.LayoutParams.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_ALWAYS_HIDDEN\n);\n\n\nThis can be used to suppress the soft-keyboard until the user actually touches the editText View.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I got one more solution to hide keyboard:\n\nInputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager) getSystemService(Activity.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);\nimm.toggleSoftInput(InputMethodManager.HIDE_IMPLICIT_ONLY, 0);\n\n\nHere pass HIDE_IMPLICIT_ONLY at the position of showFlag and 0 at the position of hiddenFlag.

My exact requirement is to have a button that will with 100% reliability show or hide the on screen keyboard.  When the keyboard is in its hidden state is should not re-appear, no matter what input fields the user clicks on.  When it is in its visible state the keyboard should not disappear no matter what buttons the user clicks.  This needs to work on Android 2.2+ all the way up to the latest devices.\n\nYou can see a working implementation of this in my app clean RPN.\n\nAfter testing many of the suggested answers on a number of different phones (including froyo and gingerbread devices) it became apparent that android apps can reliably:\n\n\nTemporarily hide the keyboard.  It will re-appear again when a user\nfocuses a new text field.\nShow the keyboard when an activity starts\nand set a flag on the activity indicating that they keyboard should\nalways be visible.  This flag can only be set when an activity is\ninitialising.\nMark an activity to never show or allow the use of the\nkeyboard.  This flag can only be set when an activity is\ninitialising.\n\n\nFor me, temporarily hiding the keyboard is not enough.  On some devices it will re-appear as soon as a new text field is focused.  As my app uses multiple text fields on one page, focusing a new text field will cause the hidden keyboard to pop back up again.\n\nUnfortunately item 2 and 3 on the list only work reliability when an activity is being started.  Once the activity has become visible you cannot permanently hide or show the keyboard.  The trick is to actually restart your activity when the user presses the keyboard toggle button.  In my app when the user presses on the toggle keyboard button, the following code runs:\n\nprivate void toggleKeyboard(){\n\n    if(keypadPager.getVisibility() == View.VISIBLE){\n        Intent i = new Intent(this, MainActivity.class);\n        i.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION);\n        Bundle state = new Bundle();\n        onSaveInstanceState(state);\n        state.putBoolean(SHOW_KEYBOARD, true);\n        i.putExtras(state);\n\n        startActivity(i);\n    }\n    else{\n        Intent i = new Intent(this, MainActivity.class);\n        i.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION);\n        Bundle state = new Bundle();\n        onSaveInstanceState(state);\n        state.putBoolean(SHOW_KEYBOARD, false);\n        i.putExtras(state);\n\n        startActivity(i);\n    }\n}\n\n\nThis causes the current activity to have its state saved into a Bundle, and then the activity is started, passing through an boolean which indicates if the keyboard should be shown or hidden.\n\nInside the onCreate method the following code is run:\n\nif(bundle.getBoolean(SHOW_KEYBOARD)){\n    ((InputMethodManager) getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE)).showSoftInput(newEquationText,0);\n    getWindow().setSoftInputMode(LayoutParams.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_ALWAYS_VISIBLE);\n}\nelse{\n    getWindow().setFlags(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_ALT_FOCUSABLE_IM,\n            WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_ALT_FOCUSABLE_IM);\n}\n\n\nIf the soft keyboard should be shown, then the InputMethodManager is told to show the keyboard and the window is instructed to make the soft input always visible. If the soft keyboard should be hidden then the WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_ALT_FOCUSABLE_IM is set.\n\nThis approach works reliably on all devices I have tested on - from a 4 year old HTC phone running android 2.2 up to a nexus 7 running 4.2.2.  The only disadvantage with this approach is you need to be careful with handling the back button.  As my app essentially only has one screen (its a calculator) I can override onBackPressed() and return to the devices home screen.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution16","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Alternatively to this all around solution, if you wanted to close the soft keyboard from anywhere without having a reference to the (EditText) field that was used to open the keyboard, but still wanted to do it if the field was focused, you could use this (from an Activity):\n\nif (getCurrentFocus() != null) {\n    InputMethodManager imm = (InputMethodManager) getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);\n    imm.hideSoftInputFromWindow(getCurrentFocus().getWindowToken(), 0);\n}\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution17","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Thank God its officially supported after 11 years\nFirst add dependency implementation &apos;androidx.core:core-ktx:1.7.0&apos; to app gradle\nHere is the simple project on github\nimport android.app.Activity\nimport android.content.Context\nimport android.view.View\nimport androidx.core.view.WindowInsetsCompat\nimport androidx.core.view.WindowInsetsControllerCompat\nimport androidx.fragment.app.Fragment\nimport androidx.fragment.app.FragmentActivity\n\n\nfun View.showKeyboard() = (this.context as?

<p>After writing in the edit field and clicking on the <code>Button</code>, I want to hide the virtual keyboard when touching it outside the keyboard. I assume that this is a simple piece of code, but where can I find an example of it?</p>

<p>To help clarify this madness, I'd like to begin by apologizing on behalf of all Android users for Google's downright ridiculous treatment of the soft keyboard. The reason there are so many answers, each different, for the same simple question is that this API, like many others in Android, is horribly designed. I can think of no polite way to state it.</p>
<p>I want to hide the keyboard.  I expect to provide Android with the following statement: <code>Keyboard.hide()</code>. The end. Thank you very much.  But Android has a problem.  You must use the <code>InputMethodManager</code> to hide the keyboard. OK, fine, this is Android's API to the keyboard. BUT! You are required to have a <code>Context</code> in order to get access to the IMM. Now we have a problem.  I may want to hide the keyboard from a static or utility class that has no use or need for any <code>Context</code>. or And FAR worse, the IMM requires that you specify what <code>View</code> (or even worse, what <code>Window</code>) you want to hide the keyboard FROM.</p>
<p>This is what makes hiding the keyboard so challenging. Dear Google: When I'm looking up the recipe for a cake, there is no <code>RecipeProvider</code> on Earth that would refuse to provide me with the recipe unless I first answer WHO the cake will be eaten by AND where it will be eaten!!</p>
<p>This sad story ends with the ugly truth: to hide the Android keyboard, you will be required to provide 2 forms of identification: a <code>Context</code> and either a <code>View</code> or a <code>Window</code>.</p>
<p>I have created a static utility method that can do the job VERY solidly, provided you call it from an <code>Activity</code>.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">hideKeyboard</span><span class="hljs-params">(Activity activity)</span> {
    <span class="hljs-type">InputMethodManager</span> <span class="hljs-variable">imm</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> (InputMethodManager) activity.getSystemService(Activity.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
    <span class="hljs-comment">//Find the currently focused view, so we can grab the correct window token from it.</span>
    <span class="hljs-type">View</span> <span class="hljs-variable">view</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> activity.getCurrentFocus();
    <span class="hljs-comment">//If no view currently has focus, create a new one, just so we can grab a window token from it</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (view == <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>) {
        view = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">View</span>(activity);
    }
    imm.hideSoftInputFromWindow(view.getWindowToken(), <span class="hljs-number">0</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Be aware that this utility method ONLY works when called from an <code>Activity</code>! The above method calls <code>getCurrentFocus</code> of the target <code>Activity</code> to fetch the proper window token.</p>
<p>But suppose you want to hide the keyboard from an <code>EditText</code> hosted in a <code>DialogFragment</code>? You can't use the method above for that:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-scss"><span class="hljs-built_in">hideKeyboard</span>(getActivity()); <span class="hljs-comment">//won't work</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This won't work because you'll be passing a reference to the <code>Fragment</code>'s host <code>Activity</code>, which will have no focused control while the <code>Fragment</code> is shown! Wow! So, for hiding the keyboard from fragments, I resort to the lower-level, more common, and uglier:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">hideKeyboardFrom</span><span class="hljs-params">(Context context, View view)</span> {
    <span class="hljs-type">InputMethodManager</span> <span class="hljs-variable">imm</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> (InputMethodManager) context.getSystemService(Activity.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
    imm.hideSoftInputFromWindow(view.getWindowToken(), <span class="hljs-number">0</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Below is some additional information gleaned from more time wasted chasing this solution:</p>
<p><strong>About windowSoftInputMode</strong></p>
<p>There's yet another point of contention to be aware of. By default, Android will automatically assign initial focus to the first <code>EditText</code> or focusable control in your <code>Activity</code>.  It naturally follows that the InputMethod (typically the soft keyboard) will respond to the focus event by showing itself. The <code>windowSoftInputMode</code> attribute in <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>, when set to <code>stateAlwaysHidden</code>, instructs the keyboard to ignore this automatically-assigned initial focus.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">activity</span>
    <span class="hljs-attr">android:name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">".MyActivity"</span>
    <span class="hljs-attr">android:windowSoftInputMode</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"stateAlwaysHidden"</span>/&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Almost unbelievably, it appears to do nothing to prevent the keyboard from opening when you touch the control (unless <code>focusable="false"</code> and/or <code>focusableInTouchMode="false"</code> are assigned to the control). Apparently, the windowSoftInputMode setting applies only to automatic focus events, not to focus events triggered by touch events.</p>
<p>Therefore, <code>stateAlwaysHidden</code> is VERY poorly named indeed. It should perhaps be called <code>ignoreInitialFocus</code> instead.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>UPDATE: More ways to get a window token</strong></p>
<p>If there is no focused view (e.g. can happen if you just changed fragments), there are other views that will supply a useful window token.</p>
<p>These are alternatives for the above code <code>if (view == null)   view = new View(activity);</code>  These don't refer explicitly to your activity.</p>
<p>Inside a fragment class:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-ini"><span class="hljs-attr">view</span> = getView().getRootView().getWindowToken()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Given a fragment <code>fragment</code> as a parameter:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-ini"><span class="hljs-attr">view</span> = fragment.getView().getRootView().getWindowToken()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Starting from your content body:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-ini"><span class="hljs-attr">view</span> = findViewById(android.R.id.content).getRootView().getWindowToken()<span class="hljs-comment">;</span>
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p><strong>UPDATE 2: Clear focus to avoid showing keyboard again if you open the app from the background</strong></p>
<p>Add this line to the end of the method:</p>
<p><code>view.clearFocus();</code></p>

<p>If all the other answers here don't work for you as you would like them to, there's another way of manually controlling the keyboard.</p>

<p>Create a function with that will manage some of the <code>EditText</code>'s properties:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-scss">public void <span class="hljs-built_in">setEditTextFocus</span>(boolean isFocused) {
    searchEditText<span class="hljs-selector-class">.setCursorVisible</span>(isFocused);
    searchEditText<span class="hljs-selector-class">.setFocusable</span>(isFocused);
    searchEditText<span class="hljs-selector-class">.setFocusableInTouchMode</span>(isFocused);

    if (isFocused) {
        searchEditText<span class="hljs-selector-class">.requestFocus</span>();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, make sure that onFocus of the <code>EditText</code> you open/close the keyboard:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-scss">searchEditText<span class="hljs-selector-class">.setOnFocusChangeListener</span>(new OnFocusChangeListener() {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">@Override</span>
    public void onFocusChange(View v, boolean hasFocus) {
        if (v == searchEditText) {
            if (hasFocus) {
                <span class="hljs-comment">// Open keyboard</span>
                ((InputMethodManager) context<span class="hljs-selector-class">.getSystemService</span>(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE))<span class="hljs-selector-class">.showSoftInput</span>(searchEditText, InputMethodManager.SHOW_FORCED);
            } else {
                <span class="hljs-comment">// Close keyboard</span>
                ((InputMethodManager) context<span class="hljs-selector-class">.getSystemService</span>(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE))<span class="hljs-selector-class">.hideSoftInputFromWindow</span>(searchEditText.getWindowToken(), <span class="hljs-number">0</span>);
            }
        }
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now, whenever you want to open the keyboard manually call: </p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-scss"><span class="hljs-built_in">setEditTextFocus</span>(true);
</code></pre>

<p>And for closing call:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-scss"><span class="hljs-built_in">setEditTextFocus</span>(false);

<h2>The short answer</h2>

<p>In your <code>OnClick</code> listener call the <code>onEditorAction</code> of the <code>EditText</code> with <code>IME_ACTION_DONE</code></p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-typescript">button.<span class="hljs-title function_">setOnClickListener</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">OnClickListener</span>() {

    <span class="hljs-meta">@Override</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">onClick</span>(<span class="hljs-params">View v</span>) {
        someEditText.<span class="hljs-title function_">onEditorAction</span>(<span class="hljs-title class_">EditorInfo</span>.<span class="hljs-property">IME_ACTION_DONE</span>)
    }
});
</code></pre>

<h2>The drill-down</h2>

<p>I feel this method is better, simpler and more aligned with Android's design pattern.
In the simple example above (and usually in most of the common cases) you'll have an <code>EditText</code> that has/had focus and it also usually was the one to invoke the keyboard in the first place (it is definitely able to invoke it in many common scenarios). In that same way, <strong>it</strong> should be the one to release the keyboard, usually that can be done by an <code>ImeAction</code>. Just see how an <code>EditText</code> with <code>android:imeOptions="actionDone"</code> behaves, you want to achieve the same behavior by the same means.</p>

<p>In v3.2.4_r1 <code>setSoftInputShownOnFocus(boolean show)</code> was added to control weather or not to display the keyboard when a TextView gets focus, but its still hidden so reflection must be used:</p>

<p>For older versions, I got very good results (but far from perfect) with a <code>OnGlobalLayoutListener</code>, added with the aid of a <code>ViewTreeObserver</code> from my root view and then checking if the keyboard is shown like this:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-meta">@Override</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">onGlobalLayout</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> {
    <span class="hljs-type">Configuration</span> <span class="hljs-variable">config</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> getResources().getConfiguration();

    <span class="hljs-comment">// Dont allow the default keyboard to show up</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (config.keyboardHidden != Configuration.KEYBOARDHIDDEN_YES) {
        <span class="hljs-type">InputMethodManager</span> <span class="hljs-variable">imm</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> (InputMethodManager) getSystemService(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE);
        imm.hideSoftInputFromWindow(mRootView.getWindowToken(), <span class="hljs-number">0</span>);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This last solution may show the keyboard for a split second and messes with the selection handles.</p>

<p>When in the keyboard enters full screen, onGlobalLayout isn't called. To avoid that, use <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView.html#setImeOptions%28int%29" rel="noreferrer">TextView#setImeOptions(int)</a> or in the TextView XML declaration:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet"><span class="hljs-symbol">android:</span>imeOptions=<span class="hljs-string">"actionNone|actionUnspecified|flagNoFullscreen|flagNoExtractUi"</span>
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Just found what dialogs use to never show the keyboard and works in all versions:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-scss"><span class="hljs-built_in">getWindow</span>()<span class="hljs-selector-class">.setFlags</span>(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_ALT_FOCUSABLE_IM,

<p>I have spent more than two days working through all of the solutions posted in the thread and have found them lacking in one way or another.  My exact requirement is to have a button that will with 100% reliability show or hide the on screen keyboard.  When the keyboard is in its hidden state is should not re-appear, no matter what input fields the user clicks on.  When it is in its visible state the keyboard should not disappear no matter what buttons the user clicks.  This needs to work on Android 2.2+ all the way up to the latest devices.</p>

<p>You can see a working implementation of this in my app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.lukesleeman.rpn&amp;hl=en" rel="noreferrer">clean RPN</a>.</p>

<p>After testing many of the suggested answers on a number of different phones (including froyo and gingerbread devices) it became apparent that android apps can reliably:</p>

<ol>
<li>Temporarily hide the keyboard.  It will re-appear again when a user
focuses a new text field.</li>
<li>Show the keyboard when an activity starts
and set a flag on the activity indicating that they keyboard should
always be visible.  This flag can only be set when an activity is
initialising.</li>
<li>Mark an activity to never show or allow the use of the
keyboard.  This flag can only be set when an activity is
initialising.</li>
</ol>

<p>For me, temporarily hiding the keyboard is not enough.  On some devices it will re-appear as soon as a new text field is focused.  As my app uses multiple text fields on one page, focusing a new text field will cause the hidden keyboard to pop back up again.</p>

<p>Unfortunately item 2 and 3 on the list only work reliability when an activity is being started.  Once the activity has become visible you cannot permanently hide or show the keyboard.  The trick is to actually restart your activity when the user presses the keyboard toggle button.  In my app when the user presses on the toggle keyboard button, the following code runs:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">toggleKeyboard</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>{

    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(keypadPager.getVisibility() == View.VISIBLE){
        <span class="hljs-type">Intent</span> <span class="hljs-variable">i</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Intent</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">this</span>, MainActivity.class);
        i.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION);
        <span class="hljs-type">Bundle</span> <span class="hljs-variable">state</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Bundle</span>();
        onSaveInstanceState(state);
        state.putBoolean(SHOW_KEYBOARD, <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>);
        i.putExtras(state);

        startActivity(i);
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>{
        <span class="hljs-type">Intent</span> <span class="hljs-variable">i</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Intent</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">this</span>, MainActivity.class);
        i.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION);
        <span class="hljs-type">Bundle</span> <span class="hljs-variable">state</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Bundle</span>();
        onSaveInstanceState(state);
        state.putBoolean(SHOW_KEYBOARD, <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>);
        i.putExtras(state);

        startActivity(i);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This causes the current activity to have its state saved into a Bundle, and then the activity is started, passing through an boolean which indicates if the keyboard should be shown or hidden.</p>

<p>Inside the onCreate method the following code is run:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-scss"><span class="hljs-built_in">if</span>(bundle.getBoolean(SHOW_KEYBOARD)){
    ((InputMethodManager) <span class="hljs-built_in">getSystemService</span>(Context.INPUT_METHOD_SERVICE))<span class="hljs-selector-class">.showSoftInput</span>(newEquationText,<span class="hljs-number">0</span>);
    <span class="hljs-built_in">getWindow</span>()<span class="hljs-selector-class">.setSoftInputMode</span>(LayoutParams.SOFT_INPUT_STATE_ALWAYS_VISIBLE);
}
else{
    <span class="hljs-built_in">getWindow</span>()<span class="hljs-selector-class">.setFlags</span>(WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_ALT_FOCUSABLE_IM,
            WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_ALT_FOCUSABLE_IM);
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the soft keyboard should be shown, then the InputMethodManager is told to show the keyboard and the window is instructed to make the soft input always visible. If the soft keyboard should be hidden then the WindowManager.LayoutParams.FLAG_ALT_FOCUSABLE_IM is set.</p>

<p>This approach works reliably on all devices I have tested on - from a 4 year old HTC phone running android 2.2 up to a nexus 7 running 4.2.2.  The only disadvantage with this approach is you need to be careful with handling the back button.  As my app essentially only has one screen (its a calculator) I can override onBackPressed() and return to the devices home screen.</p>

<p>If you want to close the soft keyboard during a unit or functional test, you can do so by clicking the "back button" from your test:</p>

<p>I put "back button" in quotes, since the above doesn't trigger the <code>onBackPressed()</code> for the Activity in question. It just closes the keyboard.</p>

<p>Make sure to pause for a little while before moving on, since it takes a little while to close the back button, so subsequent clicks to Views, etc., won't be registered until after a short pause (1 second is long enough ime).</p>

The reason there are so many answers, each different, for the same simple question is that this API, like many others in Android, is horribly designed. I can think of no polite way to state it.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I want to hide the keyboard.  I expect to provide Android with the following statement: \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Keyboard.hide()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. The end. Thank you very much.  But Android has a problem.  You must use the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;InputMethodManager\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to hide the keyboard. OK, fine, this is Android\u0026apos;s API to the keyboard. BUT! You are required to have a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Context\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; in order to get access to the IMM. Now we have a problem.  I may want to hide the keyboard from a static or utility class that has no use or need for any \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Context\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. or And FAR worse, the IMM requires that you specify what \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;View\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; (or even worse, what \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Window\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;) you want to hide the keyboard FROM.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This is what makes hiding the keyboard so challenging.

My exact requirement is to have a button that will with 100% reliability show or hide the on screen keyboard.  When the keyboard is in its hidden state is should not re-appear, no matter what input fields the user clicks on.  When it is in its visible state the keyboard should not disappear no matter what buttons the user clicks.  This needs to work on Android 2.2+ all the way up to the latest devices.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You can see a working implementation of this in my app \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.lukesleeman.rpn\u0026amp;amp;hl=en\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;clean RPN\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;After testing many of the suggested answers on a number of different phones (including froyo and gingerbread devices) it became apparent that android apps can reliably:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ol\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Temporarily hide the keyboard.  It will re-appear again when a user\nfocuses a new text field.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Show the keyboard when an activity starts\nand set a flag on the activity indicating that they keyboard should\nalways be visible.  This flag can only be set when an activity is\ninitialising.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Mark an activity to never show or allow the use of the\nkeyboard.  This flag can only be set when an activity is\ninitialising.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ol\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;For me, temporarily hiding the keyboard is not enough.  On some devices it will re-appear as soon as a new text field is focused.  As my app uses multiple text fields on one page, focusing a new text field will cause the hidden keyboard to pop back up again.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Unfortunately item 2 and 3 on the list only work reliability when an activity is being started.  Once the activity has become visible you cannot permanently hide or show the keyboard.  The trick is to actually restart your activity when the user presses the keyboard toggle button.  In my app when the user presses on the toggle keyboard button, the following code runs:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;default s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-java\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;private\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;
