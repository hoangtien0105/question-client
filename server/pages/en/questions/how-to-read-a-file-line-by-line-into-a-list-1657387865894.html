The most commonly used function to open a file in Python is open, it takes one mandatory argument and two optional ones in Python 2.7:\n\n\nFilename\nMode\nBuffering (I&apos;ll ignore this argument in this answer)\n\n\nThe filename should be a string that represents the path to the file. For example:\n\nopen(&apos;afile&apos;)   # opens the file named afile in the current working directory\nopen(&apos;adir/afile&apos;)            # relative path (relative to the current working directory)\nopen(&apos;C:/users/aname/afile&apos;)  # absolute path (windows)\nopen(&apos;/usr/local/afile&apos;)      # absolute path (linux)\n\n\nNote that the file extension needs to be specified. This is especially important for Windows users because file extensions like .txt or .doc, etc. are hidden by default when viewed in the explorer.\n\nThe second argument is the mode, it&apos;s r by default which means &quot;read-only&quot;. That&apos;s exactly what you need in your case. \n\nBut in case you actually want to create a file and/or write to a file you&apos;ll need a different argument here. There is an excellent answer if you want an overview.\n\nFor reading a file you can omit the mode or pass it in explicitly:\n\nopen(filename)\nopen(filename, &apos;r&apos;)\n\n\nBoth will open the file in read-only mode. In case you want to read in a binary file on Windows you need to use the mode rb:\n\nopen(filename, &apos;rb&apos;)\n\n\nOn other platforms the &apos;b&apos; (binary mode) is simply ignored.\n\n\n\nNow that I&apos;ve shown how to open the file, let&apos;s talk about the fact that you always need to close it again. Otherwise it will keep an open file-handle to the file until the process exits (or Python garbages the file-handle). \n\nWhile you could use:\n\nf = open(filename)\n# ... do stuff with f\nf.close()\n\n\nThat will fail to close the file when something between open and close throws an exception. You could avoid that by using a try and finally:\n\nf = open(filename)\n# nothing in between!\ntry:\n    # do stuff with f\nfinally:\n    f.close()\n\n\nHowever Python provides context managers that have a prettier syntax (but for open it&apos;s almost identical to the try and finally above):\n\nwith open(filename) as f:\n    # do stuff with f\n# The file is always closed after the with-scope ends.\n\n\nThe last approach is the recommended approach to open a file in Python!\n\nReading the file\n\nOkay, you&apos;ve opened the file, now how to read it? \n\nThe open function returns a file object and it supports Pythons iteration protocol. Each iteration will give you a line:\n\nwith open(filename) as f:\n    for line in f:\n        print(line)\n\n\nThis will print each line of the file. Note however that each line will contain a newline character \\n at the end (you might want to check if your Python is built with universal newlines support - otherwise you could also have \\r\\n on Windows or \\r on Mac as newlines). If you don&apos;t want that you can could simply remove the last character (or the last two characters on Windows):\n\nwith open(filename) as f:\n    for line in f:\n        print(line[:-1])\n\n\nBut the last line doesn&apos;t necessarily has a trailing newline, so one shouldn&apos;t use that. One could check if it ends with a trailing newline and if so remove it:\n\nwith open(filename) as f:\n    for line in f:\n        if line.endswith(&apos;\\n&apos;):\n            line = line[:-1]\n        print(line)\n\n\nBut you could simply remove all whitespaces (including the \\n character) from the end of the string, this will also remove all other trailing whitespaces so you have to be careful if these are important:\n\nwith open(filename) as f:\n    for line in f:\n        print(f.rstrip())\n\n\nHowever if the lines end with \\r\\n (Windows &quot;newlines&quot;) that .rstrip() will also take care of the \\r!\n\nStore the contents as list\n\nNow that you know how to open the file and read it, it&apos;s time to store the contents in a list. The simplest option would be to use the list function:\n\nwith open(filename) as f:\n    lst = list(f)\n\n\nIn case you want to strip the trailing newlines you could use a list comprehension instead:\n\nwith open(filename) as f:\n    lst = [line.rstrip() for line in f]\n\n\nOr even simpler: The .readlines() method of the file object by default returns a list of the lines:\n\nwith open(filename) as f:\n    lst = f.readlines()\n\n\nThis will also include the trailing newline characters, if you don&apos;t want them I would recommend the [line.rstrip() for line in f] approach because it avoids keeping two lists containing all the lines in memory.\n\nThere&apos;s an additional option to get the desired output, however it&apos;s rather &quot;suboptimal&quot;: read the complete file in a string and then split on newlines:\n\nwith open(filename) as f:\n    lst = f.read().split(&apos;\\n&apos;)\n\n\nor:\n\nwith open(filename) as f:\n    lst = f.read().splitlines()\n\n\nThese take care of the trailing newlines automatically because the split character isn&apos;t included. However they are not ideal because you keep the file as string and as a list of lines in memory!\n\nSummary\n\n\nUse with open(...) as f when opening files because you don&apos;t need to take care of closing the file yourself and it closes the file even if some exception happens.\nfile objects support the iteration protocol so reading a file line-by-line is as simple as for line in the_file_object:.\nAlways browse the documentation for the available functions/classes. Most of the time there&apos;s a perfect match for the task or at least one or two good ones. The obvious choice in this case would be readlines() but if you want to process the lines before storing them in the list I would recommend a simple list-comprehension.\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution9","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Clean and Pythonic Way of Reading the Lines of a File Into a List\n\n\n\nFirst and foremost, you should focus on opening your file and reading its contents in an efficient and pythonic way. Here is an example of the way I personally DO NOT prefer:\n\ninfile = open(&apos;my_file.txt&apos;, &apos;r&apos;)  # Open the file for reading.\n\ndata = infile.read()  # Read the contents of the file.\n\ninfile.close()  # Close the file since we&apos;re done using it.\n\n\nInstead, I prefer the below method of opening files for both reading and writing as it\nis very clean, and does not require an extra step of closing the file\nonce you are done using it. In the statement below, we&apos;re opening the file\nfor reading, and assigning it to the variable &apos;infile.&apos;  Once the code within\nthis statement has finished running, the file will be automatically closed.\n\n# Open the file for reading.\nwith open(&apos;my_file.txt&apos;, &apos;r&apos;) as infile:\n\n    data = infile.read()  # Read the contents of the file into memory.\n\n\nNow we need to focus on bringing this data into a Python List because they are iterable, efficient, and flexible.  In your case, the desired goal is to bring each line of the text file into a separate element. To accomplish this, we will use the splitlines() method as follows:\n\n# Return a list of the lines, breaking at line boundaries.\nmy_list = data.splitlines()\n\n\n\n\nThe Final Product:\n\n# Open the file for reading.\nwith open(&apos;my_file.txt&apos;, &apos;r&apos;) as infile:\n\n    data = infile.read()  # Read the contents of the file into memory.\n\n# Return a list of the lines, breaking at line boundaries.\nmy_list = data.splitlines()\n\n\nTesting Our Code:\n\n\nContents of the text file:\n\n\n     A fost odatã ca-n povesti,\n     A fost ca niciodatã,\n     Din rude mãri împãrãtesti,\n     O prea frumoasã fatã.\n\n\n\nPrint statements for testing purposes:\n\n\n    print my_list  # Print the list.\n\n    # Print each line in the list.\n    for line in my_list:\n        print line\n\n    # Print the fourth element in this list.\n    print my_list[3]\n\n\n\nOutput (different-looking because of unicode characters):\n\n\n     [&apos;A fost odat\\xc3\\xa3 ca-n povesti,&apos;, &apos;A fost ca niciodat\\xc3\\xa3,&apos;,\n     &apos;Din rude m\\xc3\\xa3ri \\xc3\\xaemp\\xc3\\xa3r\\xc3\\xa3testi,&apos;, &apos;O prea\n     frumoas\\xc3\\xa3 fat\\xc3\\xa3.&apos;]\n\n     A fost odatã ca-n povesti, A fost ca niciodatã, Din rude mãri\n     împãrãtesti, O prea frumoasã fatã.\n\n     O prea frumoasã fatã.\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution10","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Introduced in Python 3.4, pathlib has a really convenient method for reading in text from files, as follows:\n\nfrom pathlib import Path\np = Path(&apos;my_text_file&apos;)\nlines = p.read_text().splitlines()\n\n\n(The splitlines call is what turns it from a string containing the whole contents of the file to a list of lines in the file).\n\npathlib has a lot of handy conveniences in it. read_text is nice and concise, and you don&apos;t have to worry about opening and closing the file.

First, let&apos;s create some sample data:\n\nfrom pathlib import Path\nPath(&apos;filename&apos;).write_text(&apos;foo\\nbar\\nbaz&apos;)\n\n\nFile objects are lazy iterators, so just iterate over it.\n\nfilename = &apos;filename&apos;\nwith open(filename) as f:\n    for line in f:\n        line # do something with the line\n\n\nAlternatively, if you have multiple files, use fileinput.input, another lazy iterator. With just one file:\n\nimport fileinput\n\nfor line in fileinput.input(filename): \n    line # process the line\n\n\nor for multiple files, pass it a list of filenames:\n\nfor line in fileinput.input([filename]*2): \n    line # process the line\n\n\nAgain, f and fileinput.input above both are/return lazy iterators.\nYou can only use an iterator one time, so to provide functional code while avoiding verbosity I&apos;ll use the slightly more terse fileinput.input(filename) where apropos from here.\n\n\n  In Python, how do I read a file line-by-line into a list?\n\n\nAh but you want it in a list for some reason? I&apos;d avoid that if possible. But if you insist... just pass the result of fileinput.input(filename) to list:\n\nlist(fileinput.input(filename))\n\n\nAnother direct answer is to call f.readlines, which returns the contents of the file (up to an optional hint number of characters, so you could break this up into multiple lists that way). \n\nYou can get to this file object two ways. One way is to pass the filename to the open builtin:\n\nfilename = &apos;filename&apos;\n\nwith open(filename) as f:\n    f.readlines()\n\n\nor using the new Path object from the pathlib module (which I have become quite fond of, and will use from here on):\n\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\npath = Path(filename)\n\nwith path.open() as f:\n    f.readlines()\n\n\nlist will also consume the file iterator and return a list - a quite direct method as well:\n\nwith path.open() as f:\n    list(f)\n\n\nIf you don&apos;t mind reading the entire text into memory as a single string before splitting it, you can do this as a one-liner with the Path object and the splitlines() string method. By default, splitlines removes the newlines:\n\npath.read_text().splitlines()\n\n\nIf you want to keep the newlines, pass keepends=True:\n\npath.read_text().splitlines(keepends=True)\n\n\n\n  I want to read the file line by line and append each line to the end of the list.\n\n\nNow this is a bit silly to ask for, given that we&apos;ve demonstrated the end result easily with several methods. But you might need to filter or operate on the lines as you make your list, so let&apos;s humor this request.\n\nUsing list.append would allow you to filter or operate on each line before you append it:\n\nline_list = []\nfor line in fileinput.input(filename):\n    line_list.append(line)\n\nline_list\n\n\nUsing list.extend would be a bit more direct, and perhaps useful if you have a preexisting list:\n\nline_list = []\nline_list.extend(fileinput.input(filename))\nline_list\n\n\nOr more idiomatically, we could instead use a list comprehension, and map and filter inside it if desirable:\n\n[line for line in fileinput.input(filename)]\n\n\nOr even more directly, to close the circle, just pass it to list to create a new list directly without operating on the lines:\n\nlist(fileinput.input(filename))\n\n\nConclusion\n\nYou&apos;ve seen many ways to get lines from a file into a list, but I&apos;d recommend you avoid materializing large quantities of data into a list and instead use Python&apos;s lazy iteration to process the data if possible.\n\nThat is, prefer fileinput.input or with path.open() as f.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution23","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I like to use the following.

<p>According to Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Methods of File Objects</a>, the simplest way to convert a text file into a <code>list</code> is:</p>

<p>You could simply do the following, as has been suggested:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'/your/path/file'</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f:
    my_lines = f.readlines()
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this approach has 2 downsides:</p>

<p>1) You store all the lines in memory. In the general case, this is a very bad idea. The file could be very large, and you could run out of memory. Even if it's not large, it is simply a waste of memory.</p>

<p>2) This does not allow processing of each line as you read them. So if you process your lines after this, it is not efficient (requires two passes rather than one).</p>

<p>A better approach for the general case would be the following:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'/your/path/file'</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f:
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> line <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> f:
        process(line)
</code></pre>

<p>Where you define your process function any way you want. For example:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">process</span>(<span class="hljs-params">line</span>):
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-string">'save the world'</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> line.lower():
         superman.save_the_world()
</code></pre>

<p>(The implementation of the <code>Superman</code> class is left as an exercise for you).</p>

<p>This will work nicely for any file size and you go through your file in just 1 pass. This is typically how generic parsers will work.</p>

<p>To read a file into a list you need to do three things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open the file</li>
<li>Read the file</li>
<li>Store the contents as list</li>
</ul>

<p>Fortunately Python makes it very easy to do these things so the shortest way to read a file into a list is:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">lst = <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(filename))
</code></pre>

<p>However I'll add some more explanation.</p>

<h2>Opening the file</h2>

<p>I assume that you want to open a specific file and you don't deal directly with a file-handle (or a file-like-handle). The most commonly used function to open a file in Python is <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#open" rel="noreferrer"><code>open</code></a>, it takes one mandatory argument and two optional ones in Python 2.7:</p>

<ul>
<li>Filename</li>
<li>Mode</li>
<li>Buffering (I'll ignore this argument in this answer)</li>
</ul>

<p>The filename should be a string that represents the <em>path to the file</em>. For example:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'afile'</span>)   <span class="hljs-comment"># opens the file named afile in the current working directory</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'adir/afile'</span>)            <span class="hljs-comment"># relative path (relative to the current working directory)</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'C:/users/aname/afile'</span>)  <span class="hljs-comment"># absolute path (windows)</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'/usr/local/afile'</span>)      <span class="hljs-comment"># absolute path (linux)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the file extension needs to be specified. This is especially important for Windows users because file extensions like <code>.txt</code> or <code>.doc</code>, etc. are hidden <em>by default</em> when viewed in the explorer.</p>

<p>The second argument is the <code>mode</code>, it's <code>r</code> by default which means "read-only". That's exactly what you need in your case. </p>

<p>But in case you actually want to create a file and/or write to a file you'll need a different argument here. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/30566011/5393381">There is an excellent answer if you want an overview</a>.</p>

<p>For reading a file you can omit the <code>mode</code> or pass it in explicitly:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(filename)
<span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(filename, <span class="hljs-string">'r'</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>Both will open the file in read-only mode. In case you want to read in a binary file on Windows you need to use the mode <code>rb</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(filename, <span class="hljs-string">'rb'</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>On other platforms the <code>'b'</code> (binary mode) is simply ignored.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now that I've shown how to <code>open</code> the file, let's talk about the fact that you always need to <code>close</code> it again. Otherwise it will keep an open file-handle to the file until the process exits (or Python garbages the file-handle). </p>

<p>While you could use:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">f = <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(filename)
<span class="hljs-comment"># ... do stuff with f</span>
f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>That will fail to close the file when something between <code>open</code> and <code>close</code> throws an exception. You could avoid that by using a <code>try</code> and <code>finally</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">f = <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(filename)
<span class="hljs-comment"># nothing in between!</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">try</span>:
    <span class="hljs-comment"># do stuff with f</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">finally</span>:
    f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>However Python provides context managers that have a prettier syntax (but for <code>open</code> it's almost identical to the <code>try</code> and <code>finally</code> above):</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(filename) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f:
    <span class="hljs-comment"># do stuff with f</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># The file is always closed after the with-scope ends.</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The last approach is the <strong>recommended</strong> approach to open a file in Python!</p>

<h2>Reading the file</h2>

<p>Okay, you've opened the file, now how to read it? </p>

<p>The <code>open</code> function returns a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#bltin-file-objects" rel="noreferrer"><code>file</code></a> object and it supports Pythons iteration protocol. Each iteration will give you a line:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(filename) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f:
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> line <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> f:
        <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(line)
</code></pre>

<p>This will print each line of the file. Note however that each line will contain a newline character <code>\n</code> at the end (you might want to check if your Python is built with <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-universal-newlines" rel="noreferrer">universal newlines support</a> - otherwise you could also have <code>\r\n</code> on Windows or <code>\r</code> on Mac as newlines). If you don't want that you can could simply remove the last character (or the last two characters on Windows):</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(filename) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f:
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> line <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> f:
        <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(line[:-<span class="hljs-number">1</span>])
</code></pre>

<p>But the last line doesn't necessarily has a trailing newline, so one shouldn't use that. One could check if it ends with a trailing newline and if so remove it:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(filename) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f:
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> line <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> f:
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> line.endswith(<span class="hljs-string">'\n'</span>):
            line = line[:-<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]
        <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(line)
</code></pre>

<p>But you could simply remove all whitespaces (including the <code>\n</code> character) from the <em>end of the string</em>, this will also remove all other <em>trailing</em> whitespaces so you have to be careful if these are important:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(filename) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f:
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> line <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> f:
        <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(f.rstrip())
</code></pre>

<p>However if the lines end with <code>\r\n</code> (Windows "newlines") that <code>.rstrip()</code> will also take care of the <code>\r</code>!</p>

<h2>Store the contents as list</h2>

<p>Now that you know how to open the file and read it, it's time to store the contents in a list. The simplest option would be to use the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#func-list" rel="noreferrer"><code>list</code></a> function:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(filename) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f:
    lst = <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(f)
</code></pre>

<p>In case you want to strip the trailing newlines you could use a list comprehension instead:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(filename) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f:
    lst = [line.rstrip() <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> line <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> f]
</code></pre>

<p>Or even simpler: The <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.readlines" rel="noreferrer"><code>.readlines()</code></a> method of the <code>file</code> object by default returns a <code>list</code> of the lines:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(filename) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f:
    lst = f.readlines()
</code></pre>

<p>This will also include the trailing newline characters, if you don't want them I would recommend the <code>[line.rstrip() for line in f]</code> approach because it avoids keeping two lists containing all the lines in memory.</p>

<p>There's an additional option to get the desired output, however it's rather "suboptimal": <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#file.read" rel="noreferrer"><code>read</code></a> the complete file in a string and then split on newlines:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(filename) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f:
    lst = f.read().split(<span class="hljs-string">'\n'</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(filename) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f:
    lst = f.read().splitlines()
</code></pre>

<p>These take care of the trailing newlines automatically because the <code>split</code> character isn't included. However they are not ideal because you keep the file as string and as a list of lines in memory!</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li>Use <code>with open(...) as f</code> when opening files because you don't need to take care of closing the file yourself and it closes the file even if some exception happens.</li>
<li><code>file</code> objects support the iteration protocol so reading a file line-by-line is as simple as <code>for line in the_file_object:</code>.</li>
<li>Always browse the documentation for the available functions/classes. Most of the time there's a perfect match for the task or at least one or two good ones. The obvious choice in this case would be <code>readlines()</code> but if you want to process the lines before storing them in the list I would recommend a simple list-comprehension.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Clean and Pythonic Way of Reading the Lines of a File Into a List</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>First and foremost, you should focus on opening your file and reading its contents in an efficient and pythonic way. Here is an example of the way I personally DO NOT prefer:</p>

<pre class="lang-python s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">infile = <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'my_file.txt'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'r'</span>)  <span class="hljs-comment"># Open the file for reading.</span>

data = infile.read()  <span class="hljs-comment"># Read the contents of the file.</span>

infile.close()  <span class="hljs-comment"># Close the file since we're done using it.</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Instead, I prefer the below method of opening files for both reading and writing as it
is very clean, and does not require an extra step of closing the file
once you are done using it. In the statement below, we're opening the file
for reading, and assigning it to the variable 'infile.'  Once the code within
this statement has finished running, the file will be automatically closed.</p>

<pre class="lang-python s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-comment"># Open the file for reading.</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'my_file.txt'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'r'</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> infile:

    data = infile.read()  <span class="hljs-comment"># Read the contents of the file into memory.</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Now we need to focus on bringing this data into a <strong>Python List</strong> because they are iterable, efficient, and flexible.  In your case, the desired goal is to bring each line of the text file into a separate element. To accomplish this, we will use the <strong>splitlines()</strong> method as follows:</p>

<pre class="lang-python s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-comment"># Return a list of the lines, breaking at line boundaries.</span>
my_list = data.splitlines()
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>The Final Product:</em></strong></p>

<pre class="lang-python s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-comment"># Open the file for reading.</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'my_file.txt'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'r'</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> infile:

    data = infile.read()  <span class="hljs-comment"># Read the contents of the file into memory.</span>

<span class="hljs-comment"># Return a list of the lines, breaking at line boundaries.</span>
my_list = data.splitlines()
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The simplest way to do it</strong></p>

<p>A simple way is to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read the whole file as a string</li>
<li>Split the string line by line</li>
</ol>

<p>In one line, that would give:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">lines = <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'C:/path/file.txt'</span>).read().splitlines()

<p>However, this is quite inefficient way as this will store 2 versions of the content in memory (probably not a big issue for small files, but still). [Thanks Mark Amery].</p>

<p>There are 2 easier ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using the file as an iterator</li>

<ol start="2">
<li>If you are using Python 3.4 or above, better use <code>pathlib</code> to create a path for your file that you could use for other operations in your program:</li>

<h2>Outline and Summary</h2>

<p>With a <code>filename</code>, handling the file from a <code>Path(filename)</code> object, or directly with <code>open(filename) as f</code>, do one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>list(fileinput.input(filename))</code></li>
<li>using <code>with path.open() as f</code>, call <code>f.readlines()</code> </li>
<li><code>list(f)</code></li>
<li><code>path.read_text().splitlines()</code></li>
<li><code>path.read_text().splitlines(keepends=True)</code></li>
<li>iterate over <code>fileinput.input</code> or <code>f</code> and <code>list.append</code> each line one at a time</li>
<li>pass <code>f</code> to a bound <code>list.extend</code> method</li>
<li>use <code>f</code> in a list comprehension</li>
</ul>

<p>I explain the use-case for each below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>In Python, how do I read a file line-by-line?</h2>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an excellent question. First, let's create some sample data:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> pathlib <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> Path
Path(<span class="hljs-string">'filename'</span>).write_text(<span class="hljs-string">'foo\nbar\nbaz'</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>File objects are lazy iterators, so just iterate over it.</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">filename = <span class="hljs-string">'filename'</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(filename) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f:
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> line <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> f:
        line <span class="hljs-comment"># do something with the line</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, if you have multiple files, use <code>fileinput.input</code>, another lazy iterator. With just one file:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> fileinput

<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> line <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> fileinput.<span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>(filename): 
    line <span class="hljs-comment"># process the line</span>
</code></pre>

<p>or for multiple files, pass it a list of filenames:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> line <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> fileinput.<span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>([filename]*<span class="hljs-number">2</span>): 
    line <span class="hljs-comment"># process the line</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Again, <code>f</code> and <code>fileinput.input</code> above both are/return lazy iterators.
You can only use an iterator one time, so to provide functional code while avoiding verbosity I'll use the slightly more terse <code>fileinput.input(filename)</code> where apropos from here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>In Python, how do I read a file line-by-line <strong>into a list?</strong></h2>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah but you want it in a list for some reason? I'd avoid that if possible. But if you insist... just pass the result of <code>fileinput.input(filename)</code> to <code>list</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(fileinput.<span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>(filename))
</code></pre>

<p>Another direct answer is to call <code>f.readlines</code>, which returns the contents of the file (up to an optional <code>hint</code> number of characters, so you <em>could</em> break this up into multiple lists that way). </p>

<p>You can get to this file object two ways. One way is to pass the filename to the <code>open</code> builtin:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">filename = <span class="hljs-string">'filename'</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(filename) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f:
    f.readlines()
</code></pre>

<p>or using the new Path object from the <code>pathlib</code> module (which I have become quite fond of, and will use from here on):</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> pathlib <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> Path

path = Path(filename)

<span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> path.<span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>() <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f:
    f.readlines()
</code></pre>

<p><code>list</code> will also consume the file iterator and return a list - a quite direct method as well:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> path.<span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>() <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f:
    <span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(f)
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't mind reading the entire text into memory as a single string before splitting it, you can do this as a one-liner with the <code>Path</code> object and the <code>splitlines()</code> string method. By default, <code>splitlines</code> removes the newlines:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">path.read_text().splitlines()
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to keep the newlines, pass <code>keepends=True</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">path.read_text().splitlines(keepends=<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>)
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to read the file line by line and append each line to the end of the list.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now this is a bit silly to ask for, given that we've demonstrated the end result easily with several methods. But you might need to filter or operate on the lines as you make your list, so let's humor this request.</p>

<p>Using <code>list.append</code> would allow you to filter or operate on each line before you append it:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">line_list = []
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> line <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> fileinput.<span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>(filename):
    line_list.append(line)

line_list
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>list.extend</code> would be a bit more direct, and perhaps useful if you have a preexisting list:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">line_list = []
line_list.extend(fileinput.<span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>(filename))
line_list
</code></pre>

<p>Or more idiomatically, we could instead use a list comprehension, and map and filter inside it if desirable:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">[line <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> line <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> fileinput.<span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>(filename)]
</code></pre>

<p>Or even more directly, to close the circle, just pass it to list to create a new list directly without operating on the lines:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-built_in">list</span>(fileinput.<span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>(filename))
</code></pre>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>You've seen many ways to get lines from a file into a list, but I'd recommend you avoid materializing large quantities of data into a list and instead use Python's lazy iteration to process the data if possible.</p>

<p>That is, prefer <code>fileinput.input</code> or <code>with path.open() as f</code>.</p>

<p>I would try one of the below mentioned methods. The example file that I use has the name <code>dummy.txt</code>. You can find the file <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v7ksgTyPXTCxWKLphhzJ9pV_HnxP3Rnu/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>. I presume, that the file is in the same directory as the code (you can change <code>fpath</code> to include the proper file name and folder path.) </p>

<p>In both the below mentioned examples, the list that you want is given by <code>lst</code>.</p>

<p><strong>1.&gt; First method</strong>:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">fpath = <span class="hljs-string">'dummy.txt'</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(fpath, <span class="hljs-string">"r"</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> f: lst = [line.rstrip(<span class="hljs-string">'\n \t'</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> line <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> f]

<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> lst
&gt;&gt;&gt;[<span class="hljs-string">'THIS IS LINE1.'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'THIS IS LINE2.'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'THIS IS LINE3.'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'THIS IS LINE4.'</span>]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2.&gt;</strong> In the <strong>second method</strong>, one can use <strong><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">csv.reader</a> module from Python Standard Library</strong>:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> csv
fpath = <span class="hljs-string">'dummy.txt'</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>(fpath) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=<span class="hljs-string">'   '</span>)
    lst = [row[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>] <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> row <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> csv_reader] 

<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span> lst
&gt;&gt;&gt;[<span class="hljs-string">'THIS IS LINE1.'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'THIS IS LINE2.'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'THIS IS LINE3.'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'THIS IS LINE4.'</span>]
</code></pre>

<p>You can use either of the two methods. Time taken for the creation of <code>lst</code> is almost equal in the two methods.</p>

<p>You would then use the <code>FileIO.lines</code> function, like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">file_ext_lines = FileIO.lines(<span class="hljs-string">"./path/to/file.ext"</span>):
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> i, line <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">enumerate</span>(file_ext_lines):

</code></pre>

<p>Remember that the <code>mode</code> (<code>"r"</code> by default) and <code>filter_fn</code> (checks for empty lines by default) parameters are optional.</p>

<p>You could even remove the <code>read</code>, <code>write</code> and <code>delete</code> methods and just leave the <code>FileIO.lines</code>, or even turn it into a separate method called <code>read_lines</code>.</p>
