JSON is a textual, language-independent data-exchange format, much like XML, CSV or YAML.\n\nData can be stored in many ways, but if it should be stored in a text file and be readable by a computer, it needs to follow some structure. JSON is one of the many formats that define such a structure.\n\nSuch formats are typically language-independent, meaning they can be processed by Java, Python, JavaScript, PHP, you name it.\n\nIn contrast, JavaScript is a programming language. Of course JavaScript also provides a way to define/describe data, but the syntax is very specific to JavaScript.\n\nAs a counter example, Python has the concept of tuples, their syntax is (x, y). JavaScript doesn&apos;t have something like this.\n\n\n\nLets look at the syntactical differences between JSON and JavaScript object literals.\n\nJSON has the following syntactical constraints:\n\n\nObject keys must be strings (i.e. a character sequence enclosed in double quotes &quot;). \nThe values can be either:\n\n\na string\na number\nan (JSON) object\nan array\ntrue\nfalse\nnull\n\nDuplicate keys ({&quot;foo&quot;:&quot;bar&quot;,&quot;foo&quot;:&quot;baz&quot;}) produce undefined, implementation-specific results; the JSON specification specifically does not define their semantics\n\n\nIn JavaScript, object literals can have\n\n\nString literals, number literals or identifier names as keys (since ES6, keys can now also be computed, which introduces yet another syntax).\nThe values can be any valid JavaScript expression, including function definitions and undefined.\nDuplicate keys produce defined, specified results (in loose mode, the latter definition replaces the former; in strict mode, it&apos;s an error).\n\n\n\n\nKnowing that, just by looking at the syntax, your example is not JSON because of two reasons:\n\n\nYour keys are not strings (literals). They are identifier names.\nYou cannot assign a function as a value to a &quot;JSON object&quot; (because JSON doesn&apos;t define any syntax for functions).\n\n\nBut most importantly, to repeat my explanation from the beginning: You are in a JavaScript context. You define a JavaScript object. If any, a &quot;JSON object&quot; can only be contained in a string:\n\n var obj = {foo: 42}; // creates a JavaScript object (this is *not* JSON)\n var json = &apos;{&quot;foo&quot;: 452}&apos;; // creates a string containing JSON\n\n\nThat is, if you&apos;re writing JavaScript source code, and not dealing with a string, you&apos;re not dealing with JSON. Maybe you received the data as JSON (e.g., via ajax or reading from a file), but once you or a library you&apos;re using has parsed it, it&apos;s not JSON anymore.\n\n\n\nOnly because object literals and JSON look similar, it does not mean that you can name them interchangeably. See also There&apos;s no such thing as a &quot;JSON Object&quot;.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"JSON has a much more limited syntax including:\n\n\nKey values must be quoted\nStrings must be quoted with &quot; and not &apos;\nYou have a more limited range of values (e.g. no functions allowed)\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"There is really no such thing as a &quot;JSON Object&quot;.\n\nThe JSON spec is a syntax for encoding data as a string.  What people call a &quot;JSON Object&quot; ( in javascript ) is really just an ordinary javascript object that has (probably) been de-serialized from a valid JSON string, and can be easily re-serialized as a valid JSON string.  This generally means that it contains only data ( and not functions ).  It also means that there are no dates, because JSON does not have a date type ( probably the most painful thing about JSON ;)\n\nFurthermore, (side-rant...) when people talk about a &quot;JSON Object&quot;, they almost always mean data that has the &quot;curly-braces&quot; at the top-level.  This corresponds nicely to a javascript object.  However, the JSON spec does not require that there be a single &quot;curly-braces&quot; object at the top-level of a JSON string.  It is perfectly valid JSON to have a list at the top-level, or even to have just a single value.  So, while every &quot;JSON Object&quot; corresponds to valid JSON, not all valid JSON strings correspond to what we would call a &quot;JSON Object&quot;!

JSON has been used to exchange data between applications written in any Programming language.\n\nThe JSON object is a single object that contains two functions, parse and stringify, that are used to parse and construct JSON texts.\n\nJSON.stringify produces a String that conforms to the following JSON grammar.\nJSON.parse accepts a String that conforms to the JSON grammar.\n\nThe parseJSON method will be included in the Fourth Edition of ECMAScript.

It is best known as the language embedded in web browsers but has also been widely adopted for server and embedded applications. ECMAScript is based on several originating technologies, the most well-known being JavaScript (Netscape Communications)) and JScript (Microsoft Corporation).). Though before 1994, ECMA was known as &quot;European Computer Manufacturers Association&quot;, after 1994, when the organization became global, the &quot;trademark&quot; &quot;Ecma&quot; was kept for historical reasons.\nECMAScript is the language, whereas JavaScript, JScript, and even ActionScript are called &quot;Dialects&quot;.\n\nDialects have been derived from the same language. They are are quite similar to each other as they have been derived from the same language but they have undergone some changes.\nA dialect is a variation in the language itself.

Every browser has a JavaScript interpreter.\nJavaScript is a dynamically typed language.

A name is a\nstring.  A single colon comes after each name, separating the name from the value.  A single comma separates a value from a following\nname.  The names within an object SHOULD be unique.\nECMAScript supports prototype-based inheritance. Every constructor has an associated prototype, and every object created by that constructor has an implicit reference to the prototype (called the objects\nprototype) associated with its constructor. Furthermore, a prototype may have a non-null implicit reference to its prototype, and so on; this is called the prototype chain.\n\nIn a class-based object-oriented language, in general, state is carried by instances, methods are carried by classes, and inheritance is only of structure and behavior. In ECMAScript, the state and methods are carried by objects, and structure, behavior, and state are all inherited.\nA prototype is an object used to implement structure, state, and behavior inheritance in ECMAScript. When a constructor creates an object, that object implicitly references the constructors associated prototype for the purpose of resolving property references. The constructors associated prototype can\nbe referenced by the program expression constructor.prototype, and properties added to an objects prototype are shared, through inheritance, by all objects sharing the prototype.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"As far as I understand the main difference is the flexibility. \n\nJSON is a kind of wrapper on &quot;JavaScript Object Notation&quot; which forces users to obey more strict rules for defining the objects.

For example:\n\n\nconst Object = {\n  property1: true,\n  property2: false,\n}; // creating object with JS object literal syntax\n\nconst JSON_object = JSON.stringify(Object);  // stringify JS object to a JSON string\n\nconsole.log(JSON_object); // note that the (string) keys are in double quotes\n\nconst JS_object = JSON.parse(JSON_object);  // parse JSON string to JS object\n\nconsole.log(JS_object.property1, JS_object.property2); \n// accessing keys of the newly created object\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n

<p>Can someone tell me what is the main difference between a JavaScript object defined by using <em>Object Literal Notation</em> and <em>JSON object</em>?</p>

<p>According to a JavaScript book it says this is an object defined by using <em>Object Notation</em>:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> anObject = {
    property1 : <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,

<p>Why isn't it a JSON object in this case? Just because it is not defined by using quotation marks?</p>

<p>Lets clarify first what <a href="http://www.json.org/" rel="noreferrer"><em>JSON</em></a> actually is. JSON is a <em>textual</em>, language-independent data-exchange format, much like XML, CSV or YAML.</p>

<p>Data can be stored in many ways, but if it should be stored in a text file and be readable by a computer, it needs to follow some structure. JSON is one of the many formats that define such a structure.</p>

<p>Such formats are typically language-independent, meaning they can be processed by Java, Python, JavaScript, PHP, you name it.</p>

<p>In contrast, <em>JavaScript</em> is a programming language. Of course JavaScript also provides a way to define/describe data, but the syntax is very specific to JavaScript.</p>

<p>As a counter example, Python has the concept of <em>tuples</em>, their syntax is <code>(x, y)</code>. JavaScript doesn't have something like this.</p>

<hr>

<p>Lets look at the syntactical differences between JSON and JavaScript object literals.</p>

<p>JSON has the following syntactical constraints:</p>

<ul>
<li>Object <em>keys</em> must be <strong>strings</strong> (i.e. a character sequence enclosed in double quotes <code>"</code>). </li>
<li>The values can be either:

<ul>
<li>a string</li>
<li>a number</li>
<li>an (JSON) object</li>
<li>an array</li>
<li><code>true</code></li>
<li><code>false</code></li>
<li><code>null</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Duplicate keys (<code>{"foo":"bar","foo":"baz"}</code>) produce undefined, implementation-specific results; the JSON specification specifically does not define their semantics</li>
</ul>

<p>In JavaScript, object literals can have</p>

<ul>
<li>String literals, number literals or identifier names as keys (since ES6, keys can now also be computed, which introduces yet another syntax).</li>
<li>The values can be any valid JavaScript expression, including function definitions and <code>undefined</code>.</li>
<li>Duplicate keys produce defined, specified results (in loose mode, the latter definition replaces the former; in strict mode, it's an error).</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Knowing that, just by looking at the <em>syntax</em>, your example is not JSON because of two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Your keys are not strings (literals). They are <em>identifier names</em>.</li>
<li>You cannot assign a function as a value to a "JSON object" (because JSON doesn't define any syntax for functions).</li>
</ol>

<p>But most importantly, to repeat my explanation from the beginning: You are in a JavaScript context. You define a JavaScript object. If any, a "JSON object" can only be contained in a string:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"> <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> obj = {<span class="hljs-attr">foo</span>: <span class="hljs-number">42</span>}; <span class="hljs-comment">// creates a JavaScript object (this is *not* JSON)</span>
 <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> json = <span class="hljs-string">'{"foo": 452}'</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// creates a string containing JSON</span>
</code></pre>

<p>That is, if you're writing JavaScript source code, and not dealing with a <em>string</em>, you're not dealing with JSON. Maybe you received the data as JSON (e.g., via ajax or reading from a file), but once you or a library you're using has parsed it, it's not JSON anymore.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Only because object literals and JSON look <em>similar</em>, it does not mean that you can name them interchangeably.</strong> See also <a href="http://benalman.com/news/2010/03/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-json/" rel="noreferrer">There's no such thing as a "JSON Object"</a>.</p>

<p>There is really no such thing as a "JSON Object".</p>

<p>The JSON spec is a syntax for encoding data as a string.  What people call a "JSON Object" ( in javascript ) is really just an ordinary javascript object that has (probably) been de-serialized from a valid JSON string, and can be easily re-serialized as a valid JSON string.  This generally means that it contains only data ( and not functions ).  It also means that there are no dates, because JSON does not have a date type ( probably the most painful thing about JSON ;)</p>

<p>Furthermore, (side-rant...) when people talk about a "JSON Object", they almost always mean data that has the "curly-braces" at the top-level.  This corresponds nicely to a javascript object.  However, the JSON spec does not require that there be a single "curly-braces" object at the top-level of a JSON string.  It is perfectly valid JSON to have a list at the top-level, or even to have just a single value.  So, while every "JSON Object" corresponds to valid JSON, not all valid JSON strings correspond to what we would call a "JSON Object"! ( because the string could represent a list or an atomic value )</p>

<p><em>An object structure is represented as a pair of curly brackets surrounding zero or more name/value pairs (or members).  A name is a
string.  A single colon comes after each name, separating the name from the value.  A single comma separates a value from a following
name.  The names within an object SHOULD be unique.</em></p>
<p><em>ECMAScript supports prototype-based inheritance. Every constructor has an associated prototype, and every object created by that constructor has an implicit reference to the prototype (called the objects
prototype) associated with its constructor. Furthermore, a prototype may have a non-null implicit reference to its prototype, and so on; this is called the prototype chain.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tc39/ecma262/master/img/figure-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p><em>In a class-based object-oriented language, in general, state is carried by instances, methods are carried by classes, and inheritance is only of structure and behavior. In ECMAScript, the state and methods are carried by objects, and structure, behavior, and state are all inherited.</em></p>
<p><em>A prototype is an object used to implement structure, state, and behavior inheritance in ECMAScript. When a constructor creates an object, that object implicitly references the constructors associated prototype for the purpose of resolving property references. The constructors associated prototype can
be referenced by the program expression constructor.prototype, and properties added to an objects prototype are shared, through inheritance, by all objects sharing the prototype.</em></p>

<p>As far as I understand the main difference is the <strong><em>flexibility</em></strong>. </p>

<p>JSON is a kind of wrapper on "JavaScript Object Notation" which forces users to obey more strict rules for defining the objects. And it does this by limiting the possible object declaration ways provided by JavaScript Object Notation feature.</p>

<p>As a result we have a simpler and more standardized objects which suits better on data-exchange between platforms.</p>

<p>So basically, the newObject in my example above is an object defined by using JavaScript Objeect Notation; but it is not a 'valid' JSON object because it does not follow the rules that JSON standards require.</p>

<p>First you should know what JSON is:</p>

<p>It is language agnostic data-interchange format.
The syntax of JSON was inspired by the JavaScript Object Literal notation, but there are differences between them.</p>

<p>For example, in JSON all keys must be quoted, while in object literals this is not necessary:</p>

<p>// JSON:
{ "foo": "bar" }</p>

<p>// Object literal:
var o = { foo: "bar" };
The quotes are mandatory on JSON because in JavaScript (more exactly in ECMAScript 3rd. Edition), the usage of reserved words as property names is disallowed, for example:</p>

<p>var o = { if: "foo" }; // SyntaxError in ES3
While, using a string literal as a property name (quoting the property name) gives no problems:</p>

<p>var o = { "if": "foo" }; 
So for "compatibility" (and easy eval'ing maybe?) the quotes are mandatory.</p>

<p>The data types in JSON are also restricted to the following values:</p>

<p>string
number
object
array
A literal as:
true
false
null
The grammar of Strings changes. They have to be delimited by double quotes, while in JavaScript, you can use single or double quotes interchangeably.</p>

<p>// Invalid JSON:
{ "foo": 'bar' }
The accepted JSON grammar of Numbers also changes, in JavaScript you can use Hexadecimal Literals, for example 0xFF, or (the infamous) Octal Literals e.g. 010. In JSON you can use only Decimal Literals.</p>

<p>// Invalid JSON:
{ "foo": 0xFF }</p>

<h2>Javascript Object Literal vs JSON:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Object literal syntax is a very convenient way to create javascript objects</li>
<li>The <code>JSON</code> language, which stands for 'Javascript object notation', has its syntax derived from javascript object literal syntax. It is used as a programming language independent textual data transfer format.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>JS object notation, used in JS to create objects in the code conveniently:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> JS_Object = {
  <span class="hljs-number">1</span>: <span class="hljs-number">2</span>,  <span class="hljs-comment">// the key here is the number 1, the value is the number 2</span>
  <span class="hljs-attr">a</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>, <span class="hljs-comment">// the key is the string a, the value is the string b</span>
  <span class="hljs-attr">func</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) { <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'hi'</span>) }
  <span class="hljs-comment">// the key is func, the value is the function</span>
}

<p><strong>Main differences:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>All object keys in JSON must be strings. In Javascript object keys can be strings or numbers</p>
</li>
<li><p>All strings in JSON must be quoted in "double quotes". Whereas in Javascript both single quotes and double quotes are allowed. Even with no quotes in the Javascript object notation the object keys are implicitly casted to strings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In JSON a function cannot be defined as a value of an object (since this is Javascript specific). In Javascript this is completely legal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Javascript build in <code>JSON</code> object:</strong></p>
<p><code>JSON</code> objects can be easily converted to Javascript and vice versa using the built in <code>JSON</code> object which Javascript offers in its runtime. For example:</p>

This generally means that it contains only data ( and not functions ).  It also means that there are no dates, because JSON does not have a date type ( probably the most painful thing about JSON ;)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Furthermore, (side-rant...) when people talk about a \u0026quot;JSON Object\u0026quot;, they almost always mean data that has the \u0026quot;curly-braces\u0026quot; at the top-level.  This corresponds nicely to a javascript object.  However, the JSON spec does not require that there be a single \u0026quot;curly-braces\u0026quot; object at the top-level of a JSON string.  It is perfectly valid JSON to have a list at the top-level, or even to have just a single value.  So, while every \u0026quot;JSON Object\u0026quot; corresponds to valid JSON, not all valid JSON strings correspond to what we would call a \u0026quot;JSON Object\u0026quot;! ( because the string could represent a list or an atomic value )\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;According to \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://www.json.org/js.html\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;JSON in JavaScript\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;,\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n  \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;JSON is a \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;subset\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; of the object\n  literal notation of JavaScript.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In other words, valid JSON is also valid JavaScript object literal notation but not necessarily the other way around.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In addition to reading the \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://www.json.org/\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;documentation\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, as @Filix King suggested, I also suggest playing around with the \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://www.jsonlint.com/\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;JSONLint online JSON validator\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.
