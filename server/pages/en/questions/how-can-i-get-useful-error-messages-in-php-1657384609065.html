By default these are turned off because you don&apos;t want a &quot;customer&quot; seeing the error messages. Check this page in the PHP documentation for information on the 2 directives: error_reporting and display_errors. display_errors is probably the one you want to change. If you can&apos;t modify the php.ini, you can also add the following lines to an .htaccess file:\n\nphp_flag  display_errors        on\nphp_value error_reporting       2039\n\n\nYou may want to consider using the value of E_ALL (as mentioned by Gumbo) for your version of PHP for error_reporting to get all of the errors. more info\n\n3 other items: (1) You can check the error log file as it will have all of the errors (unless logging has been disabled).

So if you are modifying PHP&apos;s display_errors configuration during runtime, (this includes anything from using ini_set in your code to using .htaccess, which is a runtime configuration file) then only the default loaded configuration settings are in play.\nHow to always avoid WSOD in development\nTo avoid a WSOD you want to make sure that your loaded configuration file has display_errors on and error_reporting set to -1 (this is the equivalent E_ALL because it ensures all bits are turned on regardless of which version of PHP you&apos;re running). Don&apos;t hardcode the constant value of E_ALL, because that value is subject to change between different versions of PHP.\nLoaded configuration is either your loaded php.ini file or your apache.conf or httpd.conf or virtualhost file. Those files are only read once during the startup stage (when you first start apache httpd or php-fpm, for example) and only overridden by runtime configuration changes. Making sure that display_errors = 1 and error_reporting = -1 in your loaded configuration file ensures that you will never see a WSOD regardless of syntax or parse error that occur before a runtime change like ini_set(&apos;display_errors&apos;, 1); or error_reporting(E_ALL); can take place.\nHow to find your (php.ini) loaded configuration files\nTo locate your loaded configuration file(s) just create a new PHP file with only the following code...\n&lt;?php\nphpinfo();\n\nThen point your browser there and look at Loaded Configuration File and Additional .ini files parsed, which are usually at the top of your phpinfo() and will include the absolute path to all your loaded configuration files.\nIf you see (none) instead of the file, that means you don&apos;t have a php.ini in Configuration File (php.ini) Path. So you can download the stock php.ini bundled with PHP from here and copy that to your configuration file path as php.ini then make sure your php user has sufficient permissions to read from that file. You&apos;ll need to restart httpd or php-fpm to load it in. Remember, this is the development php.ini file that comes bundled with the PHP source. So please don&apos;t use it in production!\n\nJust don&apos;t do this in production\nThis really is the best way to avoid a WSOD in development. Anyone suggesting that you put ini_set(&apos;display_errors&apos;, 1); or error_reporting(E_ALL); at the top of your PHP script or using .htaccess like you did here, is not going to help you avoid a WSOD when a syntax or parse error occurs (like in your case here) if your loaded configuration file has display_errors turned off.\nMany people (and stock installations of PHP) will use a production-ini file that has display_errors turned off by default, which typically results in this same frustration you&apos;ve experienced here. Because PHP already has it turned off when it starts up, then encounters a syntax or parse error, and bails with nothing to output. You expect that your ini_set(&apos;display_errors&apos;,1); at the top of your PHP script should have avoided that, but it won&apos;t matter if PHP can&apos;t parse your code because it will never have reached the runtime.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution13","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"To persist this and make it confortale, you can edit your php.ini file.

Well managed servers are cheaper.)\n.user.ini are partial php.ini&apos;s for modern setups (FCGI/FPM)\n\n\nAnd as crude alternative for runtime errors you can often use:\n\nset_error_handler(&quot;var_dump&quot;);   // ignores error_reporting and `@` suppression\n\nerror_get_last()\n\nCan be used to retrieve the last runtime notice/warning/error, when error_display is disabled.\n$php_errormsg\n\nIs a superlocal variable, which also contains the last PHP runtime message.\nisset() begone!\n\nI know this will displease a lot of folks, but isset and empty should not be used by newcomers. You can add the notice suppression after you verified your code is working. But never before.\n\nA lot of the &quot;something doesn&apos;t work&quot; questions we get lately are the result of typos like:\n\nif(isset($_POST[&apos;sumbit&apos;]))\n#                  \n\n\nYou won&apos;t get any useful notices if your code is littered with isset/empty/array_keys_exists. It&apos;s sometimes more sensible to use @, so notices and warnings go to the logs at least.\nassert_options(ASSERT_ACTIVE|ASSERT_WARNING);\n\nTo get warnings for assert() sections. (Pretty uncommon, but more proficient code might contain some.)\n\nPHP7 requires zend.assertions=1 in the php.ini as well.\ndeclare(strict_types=1);\n\nBending PHP into a strictly typed language is not going to fix a whole lot of logic errors, but it&apos;s definitely an option for debugging purposes.\nPDO / MySQLi\n\nAnd @Phil already mentioned PDO/MySQLi error reporting options. Similar options exist for other database APIs of course.\njson_last_error() + json_last_error_msg\n\nFor JSON parsing.\npreg_last_error()\n\nFor regexen.\nCURLOPT_VERBOSE\n\nTo debug curl requests, you need CURLOPT_VERBOSE at the very least.\nshell/exec()\n\nLikewise will shell command execution not yield errors on its own. You always need 2&gt;&amp;1 and peek at the $errno.\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution30","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0}],"@type":"Question"}}</script><meta name="next-head-count"

<p>Quite often I will try and run a PHP script and just get a blank screen back. No error message; just an empty screen. The cause might have been a simple syntax error (wrong bracket, missing semicolon), or a failed function call, or something else entirely.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to figure out what went wrong. I end up commenting out code, entering "echo" statements everywhere, etc. trying to narrow down the problem. But there surely must be a better way, right?</p>

<p>Is there a way to get PHP to produce a useful error message, like Java does?</p>

<p>For syntax errors, you need to enable error display in the php.ini. By default these are turned off because you don't want a "customer" seeing the error messages. <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.error-reporting" rel="noreferrer">Check this page</a> in the PHP documentation for information on the 2 directives: <code>error_reporting</code> and <code>display_errors</code>. <code>display_errors</code> is probably the one you want to change. If you can't modify the php.ini, you can also add the following lines to an .htaccess file:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">php_flag  display_errors        on
php_value error_reporting       <span class="hljs-number">2039</span>
</code></pre>

<p>You may want to consider using the value of E_ALL (as mentioned by Gumbo) for your version of PHP for <code>error_reporting</code> to get all of the errors. <a href="http://docs.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.constants.php" rel="noreferrer">more info</a></p>

<p>3 other items: (1) You can check the error log file as it will have all of the errors (unless logging has been disabled). (2) Adding the following 2 lines will help you debug errors that are not syntax errors:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">error_reporting</span>(-<span class="hljs-number">1</span>);
<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">ini_set</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'display_errors'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'On'</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>(3) Another option is to use an editor that checks for errors when you type, such as <a href="http://www.nusphere.com/products/phped.htm" rel="noreferrer">PhpEd</a>. PhpEd also comes with a debugger which can provide more detailed information. (The PhpEd debugger is very similar to xdebug and integrates directly into the editor so you use 1 program to do everything.)</p>

<p>Cartman's <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-debug/" rel="noreferrer">link</a> is also very good: <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-debug/" rel="noreferrer">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-debug/</a></p>

<p>The following enables all errors:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">ini_set</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'display_startup_errors'</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>);

<h2>PHP Configuration</h2>

<p>2 entries in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8684609/dude-wheres-my-php-ini">php.ini</a> dictate the output of errors:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong><a href="http://il1.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.display-errors" rel="noreferrer"><code>display_errors</code></a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://il1.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.error-reporting" rel="noreferrer"><code>error_reporting</code></a></strong></li>
</ol>

<p>In <strong>production</strong>, <code>display_errors</code> is usually set to <code>Off</code> (Which is a good thing, because error display in production sites is generally not desirable!).</p>

<p>However, in <strong>development</strong>, it should be set to <code>On</code>, so that errors get displayed. <strong>Check</strong>!</p>

<p><code>error_reporting</code> (as of PHP 5.3) is set by default to <code>E_ALL &amp; ~E_NOTICE &amp; ~E_STRICT &amp; ~E_DEPRECATED</code> (meaning, everything is shown except for notices, strict standards and deprecation notices). When in doubt, set it to <code>E_ALL</code> to display <strong>all</strong> the errors. <strong>Check</strong>!</p>

<h2>Whoa whoa! No check! I can't change my php.ini!</h2>

<p>That's a shame. Usually shared hosts do not allow the alteration of their php.ini file, and so, that option is sadly unavailable. But fear not! We have <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.per-user.php" rel="noreferrer">other options</a>!</p>

<h2>Runtime configuration</h2>

<p>In the desired script, we can alter the php.ini entries in runtime! Meaning, it'll run when the script runs! Sweet!</p>

<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code><strong><a href="http://il1.php.net/manual/en/function.error-reporting.php" rel="noreferrer">error_reporting</a></strong>(E_ALL);
<strong><a href="http://php.net/ini_set" rel="noreferrer">ini_set</a></strong>("display_errors", "On");</code></pre>

<p>These two lines will do the same effect as altering the php.ini entries as above! Awesome!</p>

<h2>I still get a blank page/500 error!</h2>

<p>That means that the script hadn't even run! That usually happens when you have a syntax error!</p>

<p>With syntax errors, the script doesn't even get to runtime. It fails at <strong>compile time</strong>, meaning that it'll use the values in php.ini, which if you hadn't changed, may not allow the display of errors.</p>

<h2>Error logs</h2>

<p>In addition, PHP by default logs errors. In shared hosting, it may be in a dedicated folder or on the same folder as the offending script.</p>

<p>If you have access to php.ini, you can find it under the <strong><a href="http://il1.php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.error-log" rel="noreferrer"><code>error_log</code></a></strong> entry.</p>

<h1>This is a problem of loaded vs. runtime configuration</h1>
<p>It's important to recognize that a syntax error or parse error happens during the <strong>compile</strong> or <strong>parsing</strong> step, which means that PHP will bail before it's even had a chance to execute any of your code. So if you are modifying PHP's <code>display_errors</code> configuration during runtime, (this includes anything from using <code>ini_set</code> in your code to using .htaccess, which is a runtime configuration file) then only the default <strong>loaded configuration settings</strong> are in play.</p>
<h1>How to always avoid WSOD in development</h1>
<p>To avoid a WSOD you want to make sure that your <strong>loaded configuration file</strong> has <code>display_errors</code> on and <code>error_reporting</code> set to <code>-1</code> (<em>this is the equivalent E_ALL because it ensures all bits are turned on regardless of which version of PHP you're running</em>). Don't hardcode the constant value of E_ALL, because that value is subject to change between different versions of PHP.</p>
<p>Loaded configuration is either your loaded <code>php.ini</code> file or your <code>apache.conf</code> or <code>httpd.conf</code> or virtualhost file. Those files are only read once during the startup stage (when you first start apache httpd or php-fpm, for example) and only overridden by runtime configuration changes. Making sure that <code>display_errors = 1</code> and <code>error_reporting = -1</code> in your loaded configuration file ensures that you will never see a <em>WSOD</em> regardless of syntax or parse error that occur before a runtime change like <code>ini_set('display_errors', 1);</code> or <code>error_reporting(E_ALL);</code> can take place.</p>
<h1>How to find your (php.ini) loaded configuration files</h1>
<p>To locate your loaded configuration file(s) just create a new PHP file with only the following code...</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span>
<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">phpinfo</span>();
</code></pre>
<p>Then point your browser there and look at <strong>Loaded Configuration File</strong> and <strong>Additional .ini files parsed</strong>, which are usually at the top of your <code>phpinfo()</code> and will include the absolute path to all your loaded configuration files.</p>
<p>If you see <code>(none)</code> instead of the file, that means you don't have a php.ini in <strong>Configuration File (php.ini) Path</strong>. So you can <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/php/php-src/master/php.ini-development" rel="noreferrer">download the stock php.ini bundled with PHP from here</a> and copy that to your configuration file path as php.ini then make sure your php user has sufficient permissions to read from that file. You'll need to restart httpd or php-fpm to load it in. Remember, this is the <em>development</em> php.ini file that comes bundled with the PHP source. So please don't use it in production!</p>
<hr>
<h1>Just don't do this in production</h1>
<p>This really is the best way to avoid a WSOD in development. Anyone suggesting that you put <code>ini_set('display_errors', 1);</code> or <code>error_reporting(E_ALL);</code> at the top of your PHP script or using .htaccess like you did here, is not going to help you avoid a WSOD when a syntax or parse error occurs (like in your case here) if your loaded configuration file has <code>display_errors</code> turned off.</p>
<p>Many people (and stock installations of PHP) will use a production-ini file that has <code>display_errors</code> turned off by default, which typically results in this same frustration you've experienced here. Because PHP already has it turned off when it starts up, then encounters a syntax or parse error, and bails with nothing to output. You expect that your <code>ini_set('display_errors',1);</code> at the top of your PHP script should have avoided that, but it won't matter if PHP can't parse your code because it will never have reached the runtime.</p>
    </div></div></div></div><div id="solution14" class="flex mt-5 answer items-center justify-center py-5"><div class="rounded-xl solution-inner border md:px-10 md:py-10 px-2 py-10 shadow-md bg-white"><div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-between"><h1 class="text-4xl font-semibold mb-5">Solution 14</h1><div class="tags-wrap h-max space-x-8"><div class="tags"></div></div></div><div class=" items-center justify-between"><div class=" space-x-4 md:space-x-8">
<p>To persist this and make it confortale, you can edit your php.ini file. It is usually stored in <code>/etc/php.ini</code> or <code>/etc/php/php.ini</code>, but more local <code>php.ini</code>'s may overwrite it, depending on your hosting provider's setup guidelines. Check a <code>phpinfo()</code> file for <code>Loaded Configuration File</code> at the top, to be sure which one gets loaded last.</p>

<p>Search for display_errors in that file. There should be only 3 instances, of which 2 are commented.</p>

<p>You can register your own <a href="http://de.php.net/manual/en/function.set-error-handler.php" rel="noreferrer">error handler</a> in PHP.

<p>As pointed out by other contributors, these are switched off by default for security reasons. As a useful tip - when you're setting up your site it's handy to do a switch for your different environments so that these errors are ON by default in your local and development environments.

<p>In addition to all the wonderful answers here, I'd like to throw in a special mention for the MySQLi and PDO libraries.</p>

<p>In order to...</p>

<ol>
<li>Always see database related errors, and</li>
<li>Avoid checking the return types for methods to see if something went wrong</li>
</ol>

<p>The best option is to configure the libraries to <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/language.exceptions.php" rel="noreferrer">throw exceptions</a>.</p>

<h3>MySQLi</h3>

<p>Add this near the top of your script</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">mysqli_report</span>(MYSQLI_REPORT_ERROR | MYSQLI_REPORT_STRICT);
</code></pre>

<p>This is best placed before you use <code>new mysqli()</code> or <code>mysqli_connect()</code>.</p>

<h3>PDO</h3>

<p>Set the <code>PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE</code> attribute to <code>PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION</code> on your connection instance. You can either do this in the constructor</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$pdo</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">PDO</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'driver:host=localhost;...'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'username'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'password'</span>, [
    PDO::<span class="hljs-variable constant_">ATTR_ERRMODE</span> =&gt; PDO::<span class="hljs-variable constant_">ERRMODE_EXCEPTION</span>
]);
</code></pre>

<p>or after creation</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-variable">$pdo</span>-&gt;<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">setAttribute</span>(PDO::<span class="hljs-variable constant_">ATTR_ERRMODE</span>, PDO::<span class="hljs-variable constant_">ERRMODE_EXCEPTION</span>);

<p>You can enable full error reporting (including notices and strict messages). Some people find this too verbose, but it's worth a try. Set <code>error_reporting</code> to <code>E_ALL | E_STRICT</code> in your php.ini.</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">error_reporting = E_ALL | E_STRICT
</code></pre>

<p><code>E_STRICT</code> will notify you about deprecated functions and give you recommendations about the best methods to do certain tasks.</p>

<p>If you don't want notices, but you find other message types helpful, try excluding notices:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">error_reporting = (E_ALL | E_STRICT) &amp; ~E_NOTICE
</code></pre>

<p>Also make sure that <code>display_errors</code> is enabled in php.ini. If your PHP version is older than 5.2.4, set it to <code>On</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">display_errors = <span class="hljs-string">"On"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>If your version is 5.2.4 or newer, use:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">display_errors = <span class="hljs-string">"stderr"</span>

<p>Aside from error_reporting and the display_errors ini setting, you can get SYNTAX errors from your web server's log files.

<ol>
<li><p><strong><code>ini_set()</code> / php.ini / .htaccess / .user.ini</strong></p>

<p>The settings <code>display_errors</code> and <code>error_reporting</code> have been covered sufficiently now. But just to recap when to use which option:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://php.net/ini_set" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>ini_set()</code></a> and <a href="http://php.net/error_reporting" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>error_reporting()</code></a> apply for runtime errors only.</li>
<li><a href="http://php.net/php.ini" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>php.ini</code></a> should primarily be edited for development setups. (Webserver and CLI version often have different php.ini's)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>.htaccess</code></a> flags only work for dated setups (Find a new hoster! Well managed servers are cheaper.)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.per-user.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>.user.ini</code></a> are partial php.ini's for modern setups (FCGI/FPM)<br><br></li>
</ul>

<p>And as crude alternative for runtime errors you can often use:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">set_error_handler</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"var_dump"</span>);   <span class="hljs-comment">// ignores error_reporting and `@` suppression</span>
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><a href="http://php.net/error_get_last" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>error_get_last()</code></a></p>

<p>Can be used to retrieve the last runtime notice/warning/error, when error_display is disabled.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.phperrormsg.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>$php_errormsg</code></a></p>

<p>Is a superlocal variable, which also contains the last PHP runtime message.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><code>isset()</code> begone!</strong></p>

<p>I know this will displease a lot of folks, but <a href="http://php.net/isset" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>isset</code></a> and <a href="http://php.net/empty" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>empty</code></a> should <strong>not</strong> be used by newcomers. You can add the notice suppression <strong><em>after</em></strong> you verified your code is working. But never before.</p>

<p>A lot of the "something doesn't work" questions we get lately are the result of typos like:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">isset</span>(<span class="hljs-variable">$_POST</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'sumbit'</span>]))
<span class="hljs-comment">#                  </span>
</code></pre>

<p>You won't get any useful notices if your code is littered with <code>isset</code>/<code>empty</code>/<code>array_keys_exists</code>. It's sometimes more <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4261242">sensible to use <code>@</code></a>, so notices and warnings go to the logs at least.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.assert-options.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>assert_options(ASSERT_ACTIVE|ASSERT_WARNING);</code></a></p>

<p>To get warnings for <code>assert()</code> sections. (Pretty uncommon, but more proficient code might contain some.)</p>

<p>PHP7 requires <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.zend.assertions" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>zend.assertions=1</code></a> in the php.ini as well.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.arguments.type-declaration.strict" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>declare(strict_types=1);</code></a></p>

<p>Bending PHP into a strictly typed language is not going to fix a whole lot of logic errors, but it's definitely an option for debugging purposes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>PDO / MySQLi</strong></p>

<p>And @Phil already mentioned <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/52324601">PDO/MySQLi error reporting</a> options. Similar options exist for other database APIs of course.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://php.net/json_last_error" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json_last_error()</code></a> + <a href="http://php.net/json_last_error_msg" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>json_last_error_msg</code></a></p>

You expect that your \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ini_set(\u0026apos;display_errors\u0026apos;,1);\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; at the top of your PHP script should have avoided that, but it won\u0026apos;t matter if PHP can\u0026apos;t parse your code because it will never have reached the runtime.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;To persist this and make it confortale, you can edit your php.ini file.

But there surely must be a better way, right?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Is there a way to get PHP to produce a useful error message, like Java does?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","slug":"how-can-i-get-useful-error-messages-in-php-1657384609065","postType":"QUESTION","createdAt":"2022-07-09T16:36:49.000Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-09T16:36:49.000Z","tags":[],"relatedQuestions":[]},"randomQuestions":[{"title":"The ViewData item that has the key 'XXX' is of type 'System.Int32' but must be of type 'IEnumerable\u003cSelectListItem\u003e'","slug":"the-viewdata-item-that-has-the-key-'xxx'-is-of-type-'system.int32'-but-must-be-of-type-'ienumerablelessselectlistitemgreater'-1657388454191"},{"title":"What methods of ‘clearfix’ can I use?","slug":"what-methods-of-'clearfix'-can-i-use-1657387672727"},{"title":"How do I import a module given the full path?","slug":"how-do-i-import-a-module-given-the-full-path-1657388139965"},{"title":"How can I return pivot table output in MySQL?","slug":"how-can-i-return-pivot-table-output-in-mysql-1657384715043"},{"title":"Why is my Spring @Autowired field null?","slug":"why-is-my-spring-@autowired-field-null-1657384705291"},{"title":"JSTL in JSF2 Facelets... makes sense?","slug":"jstl-in-jsf2-facelets...-makes-sense-1657387667435"},{"title":"Prototypical inheritance - writing up [duplicate]","slug":"prototypical-inheritance-writing-up-duplicate-1657385478064"},{"title":"Is there a unique Android device ID?","slug":"is-there-a-unique-android-device-id-1657388089268"},{"title":"Captured variable in a loop in C#","slug":"captured-variable-in-a-loop-in-c-1657387696779"},{"title":"Reference - What does this error mean in PHP?","slug":"reference-what-does-this-error-mean-in-php-1657384301782"},{"title":"How do I copy to the clipboard in JavaScript?","slug":"how-do-i-copy-to-the-clipboard-in-javascript-1657385501223"},{"title":"Importing installed package from script raises \"AttributeError: module has no attribute\" or \"ImportError: cannot import name\"","slug":"importing-installed-package-from-script-raises-\"attributeerror:-module-has-no-attribute\"-or-\"importerror:-cannot-import-name\"-1657387790607"},{"title":"Merge/flatten an array of arrays","slug":"mergeflatten-an-array-of-arrays-1657387827427"},{"title":"How do I profile C++ code running on Linux?","slug":"how-do-i-profile-c++-code-running-on-linux-1657384754272"},{"title":"How to remove items from a list while iterating?","slug":"how-to-remove-items-from-a-list-while-iterating-1657384496375"},{"title":"What is the meaning of single and double underscore before an object name?","slug":"what-is-the-meaning-of-single-and-double-underscore-before-an-object-name-1657387926929"},{"title":"How to center an element horizontally and vertically","slug":"how-to-center-an-element-horizontally-and-vertically-1657388132330"},{"title":"When should static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, and reinterpret_cast be used?","slug":"when-should-static_cast-dynamic_cast-const_cast-and-reinterpret_cast-be-used-1657388406205"},{"title":"What are copy elision and return value optimization?","slug":"what-are-copy-elision-and-return-value-optimization-1657385455976"},{"title":"How do I pass JavaScript variables to PHP?","slug":"how-do-i-pass-javascript-variables-to-php-1657388157033"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/questions/[slug]","query":{"slug":"how-can-i-get-useful-error-messages-in-php-1657384609065"},"buildId":"DSpI0pSdXueTMCIVyw0q4","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"locale":"en","locales":["en"],"defaultLocale":"en","scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
