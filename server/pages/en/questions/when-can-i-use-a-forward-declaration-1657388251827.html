This is why it&apos;s called an incomplete type. Therefore, you cannot use the type to declare a member, or a base class, since the compiler would need to know the layout of the type.\n\nAssuming the following forward declaration.\n\nclass X;\n\n\nHere&apos;s what you can and cannot do.\n\nWhat you can do with an incomplete type:\n\n\nDeclare a member to be a pointer or a reference to the incomplete type:\n\nclass Foo {\n    X *p;\n    X &amp;r;\n};\n\nDeclare functions or methods which accept/return incomplete types:\n\nvoid f1(X);\nX    f2();\n\nDefine functions or methods which accept/return pointers/references to the incomplete type (but without using its members):\n\nvoid f3(X*, X&amp;) {}\nX&amp;   f4()       {}\nX*   f5()       {}\n\n\n\nWhat you cannot do with an incomplete type:\n\n\nUse it as a base class\n\nclass Foo : X {} // compiler error!\n\nUse it to declare a member:\n\nclass Foo {\n    X m; // compiler error!\n};\n\nDefine functions or methods using this type\n\nvoid f1(X x) {} // compiler error!\nX    f2()    {} // compiler error!\n\nUse its methods or fields, in fact trying to dereference a variable with incomplete type\n\nclass Foo {\n    X *m;            \n    void method()            \n    {\n        m-&gt;someMethod();      // compiler error!\n        int i = m-&gt;someField; // compiler error!\n    }\n};\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to templates, there is no absolute rule: whether you can use an incomplete type as a template parameter is dependent on the way the type is used in the template.\n\nFor instance, std::vector&lt;T&gt; requires its parameter to be a complete type, while boost::container::vector&lt;T&gt; does not. Sometimes, a complete type is required only if you use certain member functions; this is the case for std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;, for example.\n\nA well-documented template should indicate in its documentation all the requirements of its parameters, including whether they need to be complete types or not.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"The main rule is that you can only forward-declare classes whose memory layout (and thus member functions and data members) do not need to be known in the file you forward-declare it.\n\nThis would rule out base classes and anything but classes used via references and pointers.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Lakos distinguishes between class usage\n\n\nin-name-only (for which a forward declaration is sufficient) and\nin-size (for which the class definition is needed).\n\n\nI&apos;ve never seen it pronounced more succinctly :)\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"As well as pointers and references to incomplete types, you can also declare function prototypes that specify parameters and/or return values that are incomplete types.

They need it in order to create the LHS or temporary object at the call site.\n\nSimilarly, if you accept an incomplete type, the caller has to have constructed the object which is the parameter.

That means header should be able to be included in a  compilation unit without causing a compiler error when you use any functions it declares.\n\nExcept\n\n\nIf this external dependency is desired behaviour. Instead of using conditional compilation you could have a well-documented requirement for them to supply their own header declaring X.

will just add to that why we need to use it.\n\nWe should be using Forward declaration wherever possible to avoid the unwanted dependency injection.\n\nAs #include header files are added on multiple files therefore, if we add a header into another header file it will add unwanted dependency injection in various parts of source code which can be avoided by adding #include header into .cpp files

<p>Put yourself in the compiler's position: when you forward declare a type, all the compiler knows is that this type exists; it knows nothing about its size, members, or methods. This is why it's called an <em>incomplete type</em>. Therefore, you cannot use the type to declare a member, or a base class, since the compiler would need to know the layout of the type.</p>

<p>Assuming the following forward declaration.</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">X</span>;
</code></pre>

<p>Here's what you can and cannot do.</p>

<p><strong>What you can do with an incomplete type:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Declare a member to be a pointer or a reference to the incomplete type:</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Foo</span> {
    X *p;
    X &amp;r;
};
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><em>Declare</em> functions or methods which accept/return incomplete types:</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-type">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">f1</span><span class="hljs-params">(X)</span></span>;
<span class="hljs-function">X    <span class="hljs-title">f2</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span>;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><em>Define</em> functions or methods which accept/return pointers/references to the incomplete type (but without using its members):</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-type">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">f3</span><span class="hljs-params">(X*, X&amp;)</span> </span>{}

<span class="hljs-function">X*   <span class="hljs-title">f5</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>       </span>{}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What you cannot do with an incomplete type:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use it as a base class</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Foo</span> : X {} <span class="hljs-comment">// compiler error!</span>

<li><p>Use it to declare a member:</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Foo</span> {
    X m; <span class="hljs-comment">// compiler error!</span>

</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Use its methods or fields, in fact trying to dereference a variable with incomplete type</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Foo</span> {
    X *m;

        <span class="hljs-type">int</span> i = m-&gt;someField; <span class="hljs-comment">// compiler error!</span>
    }
};
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>When it comes to templates, there is no absolute rule: whether you can use an incomplete type as a template parameter is dependent on the way the type is used in the template.</p>

<p>For instance, <code>std::vector&lt;T&gt;</code> requires its parameter to be a complete type, while <code>boost::container::vector&lt;T&gt;</code> does not. Sometimes, a complete type is required only if you use certain member functions; <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6012157/is-stdunique-ptrt-required-to-know-the-full-definition-of-t">this is the case for <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;</code></a>, for example.</p>

<p>A well-documented template should indicate in its documentation all the requirements of its parameters, including whether they need to be complete types or not.</p>

<p>As well as pointers and references to incomplete types, you can also declare function prototypes that specify parameters and/or return values that are incomplete types.

<p>I'm writing this as a separate answer rather than just a comment because I disagree with Luc Touraille's answer, not on the grounds of legality but for robust software and the danger of misinterpretation.</p>

<p>Specifically, I have an issue with the implied contract of what you expect users of your interface to have to know.</p>

<p>If you are returning or accepting reference types, then you are just saying they can pass through a pointer or reference which they may in turn have known only through a forward declaration.</p>

<p>When you are returning an incomplete type <code>X    f2();</code> then you are saying your caller <strong>must</strong> have the full type specification of X. They need it in order to create the LHS or temporary object at the call site.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you accept an incomplete type, the caller has to have constructed the object which is the parameter. Even if that object was returned as another incomplete type from a function, the call site needs the full declaration. i.e.:</p>

<p>I think there's an important principle that a header should supply enough information to use it without a dependency requiring other headers. That means header should be able to be included in a  compilation unit without causing a compiler error when you use any functions it declares.</p>

<p><strong>Except</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>If this external dependency is <strong>desired</strong> behaviour. Instead of using conditional compilation you could have a <em>well-documented</em> requirement for them to supply their own header declaring X. This is an alternative to using #ifdefs and can be a useful way to introduce mocks or other variants.</p></li>

<p>You will usually want to use forward declaration in a classes header file when you want to use the other type (class) as a member of the class. You can not use the forward-declared classes <em>methods</em> in the header file because C++ does not know the definition of that class at that point yet. That's logic you have to move into the .cpp-files, but if you are using template-functions you should reduce them to only the part that uses the template and move that function into the header. </p>

<p>As, Luc Touraille has already explained it very well where to use and not use forward declaration of the class.</p>

<p>I will just add to that why we need to use it.</p>

<p>We should be using Forward declaration wherever possible to avoid the unwanted dependency injection.</p>

<p>As <code>#include</code> header files are added on multiple files therefore, if we add a header into another header file it will add unwanted dependency injection in various parts of source code which can be avoided by adding <code>#include</code> header into <code>.cpp</code> files wherever possible rather than adding to another header file and use class forward declaration wherever possible in header <code>.h</code> files.</p>
