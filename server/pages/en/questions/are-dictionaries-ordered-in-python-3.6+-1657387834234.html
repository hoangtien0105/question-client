This is considered an implementation detail in Python 3.6; you need to use OrderedDict if you want insertion ordering that&apos;s guaranteed across other implementations of Python (and other ordered behavior[1]).\nAs of Python 3.7, this is a guaranteed language feature, not merely an implementation detail. From a python-dev message by GvR:\n\nMake it so. &quot;Dict keeps insertion order&quot; is the ruling. Thanks!\n\nThis simply means that you can depend on it. Other implementations of Python must also offer an insertion ordered dictionary if they wish to be a conforming implementation of Python 3.7.\n\n\nHow does the Python 3.6 dictionary implementation perform better[2] than the older one while preserving element order?\n\nEssentially, by keeping two arrays.\n\nThe first array, dk_entries, holds the entries (of type  PyDictKeyEntry) for the dictionary in the order that they were inserted. Preserving order is achieved by this being an append only array where new items are always inserted at the end (insertion order).\n\nThe second, dk_indices, holds the indices for the dk_entries array (that is, values that indicate the position of the corresponding entry in dk_entries). This array acts as the hash table. When a key is hashed it leads to one of the indices stored in dk_indices and the corresponding entry is fetched by indexing dk_entries. Since only indices are kept, the type of this array depends on the overall size of the dictionary (ranging from type int8_t(1 byte) to int32_t/int64_t (4/8 bytes) on 32/64 bit builds)\n\n\nIn the previous implementation, a sparse array of type PyDictKeyEntry and size dk_size had to be allocated; unfortunately, it also resulted in a lot of empty space since that array was not allowed to be more than 2/3 * dk_size full for performance reasons. (and the empty space still had PyDictKeyEntry size!).\nThis is not the case now since only the required entries are stored (those that have been inserted) and a sparse array of type intX_t (X depending on dict size) 2/3 * dk_sizes full is kept. The empty space changed from type PyDictKeyEntry to intX_t.\nSo, obviously, creating a sparse array of type PyDictKeyEntry is much more memory demanding than a sparse array for storing ints.\nYou can see the full conversation on Python-Dev regarding this feature if interested, it is a good read.\n\nIn the original proposal made by Raymond Hettinger, a visualization of the data structures used can be seen which captures the gist of the idea.\n\nFor example, the dictionary:\nd = {&apos;timmy&apos;: &apos;red&apos;, &apos;barry&apos;: &apos;green&apos;, &apos;guido&apos;: &apos;blue&apos;}\n\nis currently stored as [keyhash, key, value]:\nentries = [[&apos;--&apos;, &apos;--&apos;, &apos;--&apos;],\n           [-8522787127447073495, &apos;barry&apos;, &apos;green&apos;],\n           [&apos;--&apos;, &apos;--&apos;, &apos;--&apos;],\n           [&apos;--&apos;, &apos;--&apos;, &apos;--&apos;],\n           [&apos;--&apos;, &apos;--&apos;, &apos;--&apos;],\n           [-9092791511155847987, &apos;timmy&apos;, &apos;red&apos;],\n           [&apos;--&apos;, &apos;--&apos;, &apos;--&apos;],\n           [-6480567542315338377, &apos;guido&apos;, &apos;blue&apos;]]\n\nInstead, the data should be organized as follows:\nindices =  [None, 1, None, None, None, 0, None, 2]\nentries =  [[-9092791511155847987, &apos;timmy&apos;, &apos;red&apos;],\n            [-8522787127447073495, &apos;barry&apos;, &apos;green&apos;],\n            [-6480567542315338377, &apos;guido&apos;, &apos;blue&apos;]]\n\n\nAs you can visually now see, in the original proposal, a lot of space is essentially empty to reduce collisions and make look-ups faster. With the new approach, you reduce the memory required by moving the sparseness where it&apos;s really required, in the indices.\n\n\n[1]: I say &quot;insertion ordered&quot; and not &quot;ordered&quot; since, with the existence of OrderedDict, &quot;ordered&quot; suggests further behavior that the `dict` object *doesn&apos;t provide*. OrderedDicts are reversible, provide order sensitive methods and, mainly, provide an order-sensive equality tests (`==`, `!=`). `dict`s currently don&apos;t offer any of those behaviors/methods.\n\n\n\n[2]: The new dictionary implementations performs better **memory wise** by being designed more compactly; that&apos;s the main benefit here. Speed wise, the difference isn&apos;t so drastic, there&apos;s places where the new dict might introduce slight regressions (key-lookups, for example) while in others (iteration and resizing come to mind) a performance boost should be present. \n\n\nOverall, the performance of the dictionary, especially in real-life situations, improves due to the compactness introduced.  \n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Below is answering the original first question:\n\n\n  Should I use dict or OrderedDict in Python 3.6?\n\n\nI think this sentence from the documentation is actually enough to answer your question\n\n\n  The order-preserving aspect of this new implementation is considered an implementation detail and should not be relied upon\n\n\ndict is not explicitly meant to be an ordered collection, so if you want to stay consistent and not rely on a side effect of the new implementation you should stick with OrderedDict.\n\nMake your code future proof :)\n\nThere&apos;s a debate about that here.\n\nEDIT: Python 3.7 will keep this as a feature see\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Update:\nGuido van Rossum announced on the mailing list that as of Python 3.7 dicts in all Python implementations must preserve insertion order.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I wanted to add to the discussion above but don&apos;t have the reputation to comment.\nPython 3.8 includes the reversed() function on dictionaries (removing another difference from OrderedDict.\n\nDict and dictviews are now iterable in reversed insertion order using reversed().

<li><p>The second, <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/c30098c8c6014f3340a369a31df9c74bdbacc269/Objects/dict-common.h#L70" rel="noreferrer"><code>dk_indices</code></a>, holds the indices for the <code>dk_entries</code> array (that is, values that indicate the position of the corresponding entry in <code>dk_entries</code>). This array acts as the hash table. When a key is hashed it leads to one of the indices stored in <code>dk_indices</code> and the corresponding entry is fetched by indexing <code>dk_entries</code>. Since only indices are kept, the type of this array depends on the overall size of the dictionary (ranging from type <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/c30098c8c6014f3340a369a31df9c74bdbacc269/Objects/dict-common.h#L64" rel="noreferrer"><code>int8_t</code></a>(<code>1</code> byte) to <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/c30098c8c6014f3340a369a31df9c74bdbacc269/Objects/dict-common.h#L66" rel="noreferrer"><code>int32_t</code></a>/<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/c30098c8c6014f3340a369a31df9c74bdbacc269/Objects/dict-common.h#L68" rel="noreferrer"><code>int64_t</code></a> (<code>4</code>/<code>8</code> bytes) on <code>32</code>/<code>64</code> bit builds)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the previous implementation, a sparse array of type <code>PyDictKeyEntry</code> and size <code>dk_size</code> had to be allocated; unfortunately, it also resulted in a lot of empty space since that array was not allowed to be more than <code>2/3 * dk_size</code> full <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/474ef63e38726d4bcde14f6104984a742c6cb747/Objects/dictobject.c#L375" rel="noreferrer">for performance reasons</a>. (and the empty space <em>still</em> had <code>PyDictKeyEntry</code> size!).</p>
<p>This is not the case now since only the <em>required</em> entries are stored (those that have been inserted) and a sparse array of type <code>intX_t</code> (<code>X</code> depending on dict size) <code>2/3 * dk_size</code>s full is kept. The empty space changed from type <code>PyDictKeyEntry</code> to <code>intX_t</code>.</p>
<p>So, obviously, creating a sparse array of type <code>PyDictKeyEntry</code> is much more memory demanding than a sparse array for storing <code>int</code>s.</p>

<p><a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2012-December/123028.html" rel="noreferrer">In the original proposal made by Raymond Hettinger</a>, a visualization of the data structures used can be seen which captures the gist of the idea.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, the dictionary:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">d = {<span class="hljs-string">'timmy'</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'red'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'barry'</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'green'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'guido'</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'blue'</span>}
</code></pre>
<p>is currently stored as [keyhash, key, value]:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">entries = [[<span class="hljs-string">'--'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'--'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'--'</span>],
           [-<span class="hljs-number">8522787127447073495</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'barry'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'green'</span>],
           [<span class="hljs-string">'--'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'--'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'--'</span>],
           [<span class="hljs-string">'--'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'--'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'--'</span>],
           [<span class="hljs-string">'--'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'--'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'--'</span>],
           [-<span class="hljs-number">9092791511155847987</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'timmy'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'red'</span>],
           [<span class="hljs-string">'--'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'--'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'--'</span>],

</code></pre>
<p>Instead, the data should be organized as follows:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">indices =  [<span class="hljs-literal">None</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">None</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">None</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">None</span>, <span class="hljs-number">0</span>, <span class="hljs-literal">None</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>]
entries =  [[-<span class="hljs-number">9092791511155847987</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'timmy'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'red'</span>],
            [-<span class="hljs-number">8522787127447073495</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'barry'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'green'</span>],
            [-<span class="hljs-number">6480567542315338377</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'guido'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'blue'</span>]]
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can visually now see, in the original proposal, a lot of space is essentially empty to reduce collisions and make look-ups faster. With the new approach, you reduce the memory required by moving the sparseness where it's really required, in the indices.</p>

[1]: I say "insertion ordered" and not "ordered" since, with the existence of OrderedDict, "ordered" suggests further behavior that the `dict` object *doesn't provide*. OrderedDicts are reversible, provide order sensitive methods and, mainly, provide an order-sensive equality tests (`==`, `!=`). `dict`s currently don't offer any of those behaviors/methods.
</sub>
<hr>
<sub>
[2]: The new dictionary implementations performs better **memory wise** by being designed more compactly; that's the main benefit here. Speed wise, the difference isn't so drastic, there's places where the new dict might introduce slight regressions (<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/474ef63e38726d4bcde14f6104984a742c6cb747/Objects/dictobject.c#L375" rel="noreferrer">key-lookups, for example</a>) while in others (iteration and resizing come to mind) a performance boost should be present. 
</sub>
<sub>
Overall, the performance of the dictionary, especially in real-life situations, improves due to the compactness introduced.

<p>Below is answering the original first question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I use <code>dict</code> or <code>OrderedDict</code> in Python 3.6?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this sentence from the documentation is actually enough to answer your question</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The order-preserving aspect of this new implementation is considered an implementation detail and should not be relied upon</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>dict</code> is not explicitly meant to be an ordered collection, so if you want to stay consistent and not rely on a side effect of the new implementation you should stick with <code>OrderedDict</code>.</p>

<p>Make your code future proof :)</p>
