The stack typically lives at the upper end of your address space and as it is used up it heads towards the bottom of the address space (i.e. towards zero).\n\nYour process also has a heap, which lives at the bottom end of your process. As you allocate memory, this heap can grow towards the upper end of your address space. As you can see, there is a potential for the heap to &quot;collide&quot; with the stack (a bit like tectonic plates!!!).\n\nThe common cause for a stack overflow is a bad recursive call. Typically, this is caused when your recursive functions doesn&apos;t have the correct termination condition, so it ends up calling itself forever. Or when the termination condition is fine, it can be caused by requiring too many recursive calls before fulfilling it.\n\nHowever, with GUI programming, it&apos;s possible to generate indirect recursion. For example, your app may be handling paint messages, and, whilst processing them, it may call a function that causes the system to send another paint message. Here you&apos;ve not explicitly called yourself, but the OS/VM has done it for you.\n\nTo deal with them, you&apos;ll need to examine your code. If you&apos;ve got functions that call themselves then check that you&apos;ve got a terminating condition. If you have, then check that when calling the function you have at least modified one of the arguments, otherwise there&apos;ll be no visible change for the recursively called function and the terminating condition is useless. Also mind that your stack space can run out of memory before reaching a valid terminating condition, thus make sure your method can handle input values requiring more recursive calls.\n\nIf you&apos;ve got no obvious recursive functions then check to see if you&apos;re calling any library functions that indirectly will cause your function to be called (like the implicit case above).\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"To describe this, first let us understand how local variables and objects are stored.\nLocal variable are stored on the stack:\n\nIf you looked at the image you should be able to understand how things are working.\nWhen a function call is invoked by a Java application, a stack frame is allocated on the call stack. The stack frame contains the parameters of the invoked method, its local parameters, and the return address of the method. The return address denotes the execution point from which, the program execution shall continue after the invoked method returns. If there is no space for a new stack frame then, the StackOverflowError is thrown by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).\nThe most common case that can possibly exhaust a Java applications stack is recursion. In recursion, a method invokes itself during its execution. Recursion is considered as a powerful general-purpose programming technique, but it must be used with caution, to avoid StackOverflowError.\nAn example of throwing a StackOverflowError is shown below:\nStackOverflowErrorExample.java:\npublic class StackOverflowErrorExample {\n\n    public static void recursivePrint(int num) {\n        System.out.println(&quot;Number: &quot; + num);\n        if (num == 0)\n            return;\n        else\n            recursivePrint(++num);\n        }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        StackOverflowErrorExample.recursivePrint(1);\n    }\n}\n\nIn this example, we define a recursive method, called recursivePrint that prints an integer and then, calls itself, with the next successive integer as an argument. The recursion ends until we pass in 0 as a parameter. However, in our example, we passed in the parameter from 1 and its increasing followers, consequently, the recursion will never terminate.\nA sample execution, using the -Xss1M flag that specifies the size of the thread stack to equal to 1 MB, is shown below:\nNumber: 1\nNumber: 2\nNumber: 3\n...\nNumber: 6262\nNumber: 6263\nNumber: 6264\nNumber: 6265\nNumber: 6266\nException in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.StackOverflowError\n        at java.io.PrintStream.write(PrintStream.java:480)\n        at sun.nio.cs.StreamEncoder.writeBytes(StreamEncoder.java:221)\n        at sun.nio.cs.StreamEncoder.implFlushBuffer(StreamEncoder.java:291)\n        at sun.nio.cs.StreamEncoder.flushBuffer(StreamEncoder.java:104)\n        at java.io.OutputStreamWriter.flushBuffer(OutputStreamWriter.java:185)\n        at java.io.PrintStream.write(PrintStream.java:527)\n        at java.io.PrintStream.print(PrintStream.java:669)\n        at java.io.PrintStream.println(PrintStream.java:806)\n        at StackOverflowErrorExample.recursivePrint(StackOverflowErrorExample.java:4)\n        at StackOverflowErrorExample.recursivePrint(StackOverflowErrorExample.java:9)\n        at StackOverflowErrorExample.recursivePrint(StackOverflowErrorExample.java:9)\n        at StackOverflowErrorExample.recursivePrint(StackOverflowErrorExample.java:9)\n        ...\n\nDepending on the JVMs initial configuration, the results may differ, but eventually the StackOverflowError shall be thrown. This example is a very good example of how recursion can cause problems, if not implemented with caution.\nHow to deal with the StackOverflowError\n\nThe simplest solution is to carefully inspect the stack trace and\ndetect the repeating pattern of line numbers. These line numbers\nindicate the code being recursively called. Once you detect these\nlines, you must carefully inspect your code and understand why the\nrecursion never terminates.\n\nIf you have verified that the recursion\nis implemented correctly, you can increase the stacks size, in\norder to allow a larger number of invocations. Depending on the Java\nVirtual Machine (JVM) installed, the default thread stack size may\nequal to either 512 KB, or 1 MB. You can increase the thread stack\nsize using the -Xss flag. This flag can be specified either via the\nprojects configuration, or via the command line. The format of the\n-Xss argument is:\n-Xss&lt;size&gt;[g|G|m|M|k|K]\n\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"If you have a function like:\n\nint foo()\n{\n    // more stuff\n    foo();\n}\n\n\nThen foo() will keep calling itself, getting deeper and deeper, and when the space used to keep track of what functions you&apos;re in is filled up, you get the stack overflow error.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Stack overflow means exactly that: a stack overflows. Usually there&apos;s a one stack in the program that contains local-scope variables and addresses where to return when execution of a routine ends. That stack tends to be a fixed memory range somewhere in the memory, therefore it&apos;s limited how much it can contain values.\n\nIf the stack is empty you can&apos;t pop, if you do you&apos;ll get stack underflow error.\n\nIf the stack is full you can&apos;t push, if you do you&apos;ll get stack overflow error.\n\nSo stack overflow appears where you allocate too much into the stack. For instance, in the mentioned recursion.\n\nSome implementations optimize out some forms of recursions. Tail recursion in particular. Tail recursive routines are form of routines where the recursive call appears as a final thing what the routine does. Such routine call gets simply reduced into a jump.\n\nSome implementations go so far as implement their own stacks for recursion, therefore they allow the recursion to continue until the system runs out of memory.\n\nEasiest thing you could try would be to increase your stack size if you can. If you can&apos;t do that though, the second best thing would be to look whether there&apos;s something that clearly causes the stack overflow. Try it by printing something before and after the call into routine.

The normal size is 8 MB (in Ubuntu (Linux), you can check that limit with $ ulimit -u and it can be checked in other OS similarly). Any program makes use of the stack at runtime, but to fully know when it is used you need to check the assembly language. In x86_64 for example, the stack is used to:\n\nSave the return address when making a procedure call\nSave local variables\nSave special registers to restore them later\nPass arguments to a procedure call (more than 6)\nOther: random unused stack base, canary values, padding, ... etc.\n\nIf you don&apos;t know x86_64 (normal case) you only need to know when the specific high-level programming language you are using compile to those actions.

<p>Parameters and local variables are allocated on the <strong>stack</strong> (with reference types, the object lives on the <strong>heap</strong> and a variable in the stack references that object on the heap). The stack typically lives at the <strong>upper</strong> end of your address space and as it is used up it heads towards the <strong>bottom</strong> of the address space (i.e. towards zero).</p>

<p>Your process also has a <strong>heap</strong>, which lives at the <strong>bottom</strong> end of your process. As you allocate memory, this heap can grow towards the upper end of your address space. As you can see, there is a potential for the heap to <strong>"collide"</strong> with the stack (a bit like tectonic plates!!!).</p>

<p>The common cause for a stack overflow is a <strong>bad recursive call</strong>. Typically, this is caused when your recursive functions doesn't have the correct termination condition, so it ends up calling itself forever. Or when the termination condition is fine, it can be caused by requiring too many recursive calls before fulfilling it.</p>

<p>However, with GUI programming, it's possible to generate <strong>indirect recursion</strong>. For example, your app may be handling paint messages, and, whilst processing them, it may call a function that causes the system to send another paint message. Here you've not explicitly called yourself, but the OS/VM has done it for you.</p>

<p>To deal with them, you'll need to examine your code. If you've got functions that call themselves then check that you've got a terminating condition. If you have, then check that when calling the function you have at least modified one of the arguments, otherwise there'll be no visible change for the recursively called function and the terminating condition is useless. Also mind that your stack space can run out of memory before reaching a valid terminating condition, thus make sure your method can handle input values requiring more recursive calls.</p>

<p>If you've got no obvious recursive functions then check to see if you're calling any library functions that <strong>indirectly</strong> will cause your function to be called (like the implicit case above).</p>

<p>To describe this, first let us understand how <strong>local</strong> variables and objects are stored.</p>
<p>Local variable are stored on the <strong>stack</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SHTah.jpg" alt="Enter image description here"></p>
<p>If you looked at the image you should be able to understand how things are working.</p>
<p>When a function call is invoked by a Java application, a stack frame is allocated on the call stack. The stack frame contains the parameters of the invoked method, its local parameters, and the return address of the method. The return address denotes the execution point from which, the program execution shall continue after the invoked method returns. If there is no space for a new stack frame then, the <code>StackOverflowError</code> is thrown by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>
<p>The most common case that can possibly exhaust a Java applications stack is recursion. In recursion, a method invokes itself during its execution. Recursion is considered as a powerful general-purpose programming technique, but it must be used with caution, to avoid <code>StackOverflowError</code>.</p>
<p>An example of throwing a <code>StackOverflowError</code> is shown below:</p>
<p><strong>StackOverflowErrorExample.java:</strong></p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">StackOverflowErrorExample</span> {

    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we define a recursive method, called <code>recursivePrint</code> that prints an integer and then, calls itself, with the next successive integer as an argument. The recursion ends until we pass in <code>0</code> as a parameter. However, in our example, we passed in the parameter from 1 and its increasing followers, consequently, the recursion will never terminate.</p>
<p>A sample execution, using the <code>-Xss1M</code> flag that specifies the size of the thread stack to equal to 1&nbsp;MB, is shown below:</p>

<p>Depending on the JVMs initial configuration, the results may differ, but eventually the <code>StackOverflowError</code> shall be thrown. This example is a very good example of how recursion can cause problems, if not implemented with caution.</p>
<p><em><strong>How to deal with the StackOverflowError</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The simplest solution is to carefully inspect the stack trace and
detect the repeating pattern of line numbers. These line numbers
indicate the code being recursively called. Once you detect these
lines, you must carefully inspect your code and understand why the
recursion never terminates.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you have verified that the recursion
is implemented correctly, you can increase the stacks size, in
order to allow a larger number of invocations. Depending on the Java
Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, the default thread stack size may
equal to either <strong>512&nbsp;KB, or 1&nbsp;MB</strong>. You can increase the thread stack
size using the <code>-Xss</code> flag. This flag can be specified either via the
projects configuration, or via the command line. The format of the
<code>-Xss</code> argument is:
<code>-Xss&lt;size&gt;[g|G|m|M|k|K]</code></p>
</li>

<p>Stack overflow means exactly that: a stack overflows. Usually there's a one stack in the program that contains local-scope variables and addresses where to return when execution of a routine ends. That stack tends to be a fixed memory range somewhere in the memory, therefore it's limited how much it can contain values.</p>

<p>If the stack is empty you can't pop, if you do you'll get stack underflow error.</p>

<p>If the stack is full you can't push, if you do you'll get stack overflow error.</p>

<p>So stack overflow appears where you allocate too much into the stack. For instance, in the mentioned recursion.</p>

<p>Some implementations optimize out some forms of recursions. Tail recursion in particular. Tail recursive routines are form of routines where the recursive call appears as a final thing what the routine does. Such routine call gets simply reduced into a jump.</p>

<p>Some implementations go so far as implement their own stacks for recursion, therefore they allow the recursion to continue until the system runs out of memory.</p>

<p>Easiest thing you could try would be to increase your stack size if you can. If you can't do that though, the second best thing would be to look whether there's something that clearly causes the stack overflow. Try it by printing something before and after the call into routine. This helps you to find out the failing routine.</p>

<p><code>StackOverflowError</code> is to the stack as <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> is to the heap.</p>

<p>Unbounded recursive calls result in stack space being used up. </p>

<p>The following example produces <code>StackOverflowError</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span>  <span class="hljs-title class_">StackOverflowDemo</span>

<p>A <code>StackOverflowError</code> is a runtime error in Java.</p>
<p>It is thrown when the amount of call stack memory allocated by the JVM is exceeded.</p>
<p>A common case of a <code>StackOverflowError</code> being thrown, is when the call stack exceeds due to excessive deep or infinite recursion.</p>
<p>Example:</p>

<p>Here is an example of a recursive algorithm for reversing a singly linked list.

<p>My point is that we should use recursion judiciously, always taking into account of the scale of the system.</p>
<p>Often recursion can be converted to iterative program, which scales better. (One iterative version of the same algorithm is given at the bottom of the page. It reverses a singly linked list of size 1 million in 9 milliseconds.)</p>

<p>The stack has a space limit that depends on the operating system. The normal size is 8&nbsp;MB (in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_%28operating_system%29" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ubuntu</a> (Linux), you can check that limit with <code>$ ulimit -u</code> and it can be checked in other OS similarly). Any program makes use of the stack at runtime, but to fully know when it is used you need to check the assembly language. In x86_64 for example, the stack is used to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Save the return address when making a procedure call</li>
<li>Save local variables</li>
<li>Save special registers to restore them later</li>
<li>Pass arguments to a procedure call (more than 6)</li>
<li>Other: random unused stack base, canary values, padding, ... etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don't know x86_64 (normal case) you only need to know when the specific high-level programming language you are using compile to those actions. For example in C:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1)  a function call</li>
<li>(2)  local variables in function calls (including main)</li>
<li>(3)  local variables in function calls (not main)</li>
<li>(4)  a function call</li>
<li>(5)  normally a function call, it is generally irrelevant for a stack overflow.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, in C, <strong>only local variables and function calls make use of the stack</strong>. The two (unique?) ways of making a stack overflow are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Declaring too large local variables in main or in any function that it's called in (<code>int array[10000][10000];</code>)</li>
<li>A very deep or infinite recursion (too many function calls at the same time).</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid a <code>StackOverflowError</code> you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>check if local variables are too big (order of 1 MB)  use the heap (malloc/calloc calls) or global variables.</p>
</li>
<li><p>check for infinite recursion  you know what to do... correct it!</p>
</li>
<li><p>check for normal too deep recursion  the easiest approach is to just change the implementation to be iterative.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice also that global variables, include libraries, etc... don't make use of the stack.</p>
<p>Only if the above does not work, change the stack size to the maximum on the specific OS. With Ubuntu for example: <code>ulimit -s 32768</code> (32 MB). (This has never been the solution for any of my stack overflow errors, but I also don't have much experience.)</p>
<p>I have omitted special and/or not standard cases in C (such as usage of <code>alloc()</code> and similar) because if you are using them you should already know exactly what you are doing.</p>

The stack typically lives at the \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;upper\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; end of your address space and as it is used up it heads towards the \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;bottom\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; of the address space (i.e. towards zero).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Your process also has a \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;heap\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;, which lives at the \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;bottom\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; end of your process. As you allocate memory, this heap can grow towards the upper end of your address space. As you can see, there is a potential for the heap to \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026quot;collide\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; with the stack (a bit like tectonic plates!!!).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The common cause for a stack overflow is a \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;bad recursive call\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;. Typically, this is caused when your recursive functions doesn\u0026apos;t have the correct termination condition, so it ends up calling itself forever. Or when the termination condition is fine, it can be caused by requiring too many recursive calls before fulfilling it.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;However, with GUI programming, it\u0026apos;s possible to generate \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;indirect recursion\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;. For example, your app may be handling paint messages, and, whilst processing them, it may call a function that causes the system to send another paint message. Here you\u0026apos;ve not explicitly called yourself, but the OS/VM has done it for you.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;To deal with them, you\u0026apos;ll need to examine your code. If you\u0026apos;ve got functions that call themselves then check that you\u0026apos;ve got a terminating condition. If you have, then check that when calling the function you have at least modified one of the arguments, otherwise there\u0026apos;ll be no visible change for the recursively called function and the terminating condition is useless. Also mind that your stack space can run out of memory before reaching a valid terminating condition, thus make sure your method can handle input values requiring more recursive calls.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If you\u0026apos;ve got no obvious recursive functions then check to see if you\u0026apos;re calling any library functions that \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;indirectly\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; will cause your function to be called (like the implicit case above).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;To describe this, first let us understand how \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;local\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; variables and objects are stored.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Local variable are stored on the \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;stack\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/SHTah.jpg\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;Enter image description here\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If you looked at the image you should be able to understand how things are working.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When a function call is invoked by a Java application, a stack frame is allocated on the call stack. The stack frame contains the parameters of the invoked method, its local parameters, and the return address of the method. The return address denotes the execution point from which, the program execution shall continue after the invoked method returns. If there is no space for a new stack frame then, the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;StackOverflowError\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is thrown by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The most common case that can possibly exhaust a Java applications stack is recursion. In recursion, a method invokes itself during its execution.

Usually there\u0026apos;s a one stack in the program that contains local-scope variables and addresses where to return when execution of a routine ends. That stack tends to be a fixed memory range somewhere in the memory, therefore it\u0026apos;s limited how much it can contain values.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If the stack is empty you can\u0026apos;t pop, if you do you\u0026apos;ll get stack underflow error.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If the stack is full you can\u0026apos;t push, if you do you\u0026apos;ll get stack overflow error.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So stack overflow appears where you allocate too much into the stack. For instance, in the mentioned recursion.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Some implementations optimize out some forms of recursions. Tail recursion in particular. Tail recursive routines are form of routines where the recursive call appears as a final thing what the routine does. Such routine call gets simply reduced into a jump.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Some implementations go so far as implement their own stacks for recursion, therefore they allow the recursion to continue until the system runs out of memory.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Easiest thing you could try would be to increase your stack size if you can. If you can\u0026apos;t do that though, the second best thing would be to look whether there\u0026apos;s something that clearly causes the stack overflow. Try it by printing something before and after the call into routine.

For example in C:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;(1)  a function call\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;(2)  local variables in function calls (including main)\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;(3)  local variables in function calls (not main)\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;(4)  a function call\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;(5)  normally a function call, it is generally irrelevant for a stack overflow.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So, in C, \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;only local variables and function calls make use of the stack\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;. The two (unique?) ways of making a stack overflow are:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Declaring too large local variables in main or in any function that it\u0026apos;s called in (\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;int array[10000][10000];\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;)\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;A very deep or infinite recursion (too many function calls at the same time).\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;To avoid a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;StackOverflowError\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; you can:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;check if local variables are too big (order of 1 MB)  use the heap (malloc/calloc calls) or global variables.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;check for infinite recursion  you know what to do... correct it!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;check for normal too deep recursion  the easiest approach is to just change the implementation to be iterative.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Notice also that global variables, include libraries, etc... don\u0026apos;t make use of the stack.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Only if the above does not work, change the stack size to the maximum on the specific OS. With Ubuntu for example: \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ulimit -s 32768\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; (32 MB).
