Because of this, the new instance is separated from your &quot;normal&quot; Chrome data and your bookmarks and other saved data will not be available in this instance.\nNote: only the first &quot;new&quot; instance of Chrome opened with this method, is effected, hence it is only the first tab in the first new Chrome window, which is effected.\nIf you close that instance, you can use the same command again and for example any bookmarks to your local app or similar will still be there as it&apos;s pointing to the same folder.\nIf you want to run multiple &quot;insecure&quot; instances, each one will need its own folder/directory, so you will need to runt he command again with a different folder name. This however also means that each insecure instance will be separated from the others, so any bookmarks or other saves user or session data will not be available across instances.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"For Windows:\n\nOpen the start menu\n\nType windows+R or open &quot;Run&quot;\n\nExecute the following command:\n chrome.exe --user-data-dir=&quot;C://Chrome dev session&quot; --disable-web-security\n\n\n\n\nFor Mac:\n\nGo to Terminal\n\nExecute the following command:\n open /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app --args --user-data-dir=&quot;/var/tmp/Chrome dev session&quot; --disable-web-security\n\n\n\n\nA new web security disabled chrome browser should open with the following message:\n\nFor Mac\nIf you want to open new instance of web security disabled Chrome browser without closing existing tabs then use below command\nopen -na Google\\ Chrome --args --user-data-dir=/tmp/temporary-chrome-profile-dir --disable-web-security\n\nIt will open new instance of web security disabled Chrome browser  as shown below\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Using the current latest chrome Version 100.0.4896.127 (Official Build) (64-bit)\nwindows : click the start button then copy paste the below (change the D:\\temp to your liking).:\nchrome.exe  --disable-site-isolation-trials --disable-web-security --user-data-dir=&quot;D:\\temp&quot;\n\nLinux : start a terminal then run the below command (change the ~/tmp directory to your liking)\ngoogle-chrome --disable-site-isolation-trials --disable-web-security --user-data-dir=&quot;~/tmp&quot;\n\nNote : This solution will start chrome in an isolated sandbox and it will not affect the main chrome profile.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"For windows users with Chrome Versions 60.0.3112.78 (the day the solution was tested and worked) and at least until today 19.01.2019 (ver. 71.0.3578.98).

The --disable-web-security is no longer supported in recent chrome versions. \n\nAllow-Control-Allow-Origin: * - chrome extension partially solved the problem. It works only if your request is using GET method and there&apos;s no custom HTTP Header. Otherwise, chrome will send OPTIONS HTTP request as a pre-flight request. If the server doesn&apos;t support CORS, it will respond with 404 HTTP status code. The plugin can&apos;t modify the response HTTP status code. So chrome will reject this request. There&apos;s no way for chrome plugin to modify the response HTTP status code based on current chrome extension API. And you can&apos;t do a redirect as well for XHR initiated request.\n\nNot sure why Chrome makes developers life so difficult. It blocks all the possible ways to disable XSS security check even for development use which is totally unnecessary.\n\nAfter days struggle and research, one solution works perfectly for me: to use corsproxy. You have two options here: \n1. use [https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/]\n2. install corsproxy in the local box: npm install -g corsproxy\n\n[Updated on Jun 23, 2018] Recent I&apos;m developing an SPA app which need to use corsproxy again. But seem none of the corsproxy on the github can meet my requirement. \n\n\nneed it to run inside firewall for security reason. So I can&apos;t use https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/. \nIt has to support https as chrome will block no-https ajax request in an https page. \nI need to run on nodejs. I don&apos;t want to maintain another language stack.\n\n\nSo I decide to develop my own version of corsproxy with nodejs. It&apos;s actually very simple. I have published it as a gist on the github. Here is the source code gist: \nhttps://gist.github.com/jianwu/8e76eaec95d9b1300c59596fbfc21b10\n\n\nIt&apos;s in plain nodejs code without any additional dependencies\nYou can run in http and https mode (by passing the https port\nnumber in command line), to run https, you need to generate cert and\nkey and put them in the webroot directory. \nIt also serves as static file server\nIt supports pre-flight OPTION request as well.\n\n\nTo start the CORSProxy server (http port 8080):\nnode static_server.js 8080\n\nto access the proxy:\nhttp://host:8080/http://www.somesite.com\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution8","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Try this command on Mac terminal-\n\nopen -n -a &quot;Google Chrome&quot; --args --user-data-dir=/tmp/temp_chrome_user_data_dir http://localhost:8100/ --disable-web-security \n\n\nIt opens another instance of chrome with disabled security and there is no CORS issue anymore.

Why would you choose to make yourself vulnerable when the better thing to do is so simple?\nTelling people to disable security is like telling your friends to leave their front door unlocked and/or a key under the doormat. Sure the odds might be low but if they do get burgled, without proof of forced entry they might have a hard time collecting insurance. Similarly if you disable security you are doing just that disabling security. It&apos;s irresponsible to do this when you can solve the issue so simply without disabling security.

<p>Close chrome (or chromium) and restart with the <code>--disable-web-security</code> argument. I just tested this and verified that I can access the contents of an iframe with src="http://google.com" embedded in a page served from "localhost" (tested under chromium 5 / ubuntu). For me the exact command was:</p>

<p><strong>Note  :  Kill all chrome instances before running command</strong></p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">chromium-browser --disable-web-security --user-data-dir=<span class="hljs-string">"[some directory here]"</span>

<p>The browser will warn you that "you are using an unsupported command line" when it first opens, which you can ignore.</p>

<p>That should disable the same origin policy and allow you to access local files.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> For Chrome 22+ you will be presented with an error message that says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are using an unsupported command-line flag: --disable-web-security. Stability and security will suffer.</p>

<p>However you can just ignore that message while developing.</p>

<p>For Windows users:</p>
<p>The problem with the solution accepted here, in my opinion is that if you already have Chrome open and try to run the <code>chrome.exe --disable-web-security</code> command it won't work.</p>
<p>However, when researching this, I came across a post on Super&nbsp;User, <em><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/593726/is-it-possible-to-run-chrome-with-and-without-web-security-at-the-same-time">Is it possible to run Chrome with and without web security at the same time?</a></em>.</p>
<p>Basically, you need to add to the command and run it like this instead (or create a shortcut with it and run a new Chrome instance through that)</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">chrome.<span class="hljs-property">exe</span> --user-data-dir=<span class="hljs-string">"C:/Chrome dev session"</span> --disable-web-security
</code></pre>
<p>which will open a new "insecure" instance of Chrome at the same time as you keep your other "secure" browser instances open and working as normal.</p>
<p>This works by creating a new folder/directory "Chrome dev session" under C: and tells this new Chrome instance to use that folder/directory for its user and session data. Because of this, the new instance is separated from your "normal" Chrome data and your bookmarks and other saved data will not be available in this instance.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> only the first "new" instance of Chrome opened with this method, is effected, hence it is only the first tab in the first new Chrome window, which is effected.
If you close that instance, you can use the same command again and for example any bookmarks to your local app or similar will still be there as it's pointing to the same folder.</p>
<p>If you want to run multiple "insecure" instances, each one will need its own folder/directory, so you will need to runt he command again with a different folder name. This however also means that each insecure instance will be separated from the others, so any bookmarks or other saves user or session data will not be available across instances.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: I can no longer get this to work consistently.</p>

<p>EDIT: I tried using the just the other day for another project and it stopped working. Uninstalling and reinstalling the extension fixed it (to reset the defaults).</p>

<p><strong>Original Answer:</strong></p>

<p>I didn't want to restart Chrome and disable my web security (because I was browsing while developing) and stumbled onto this Chrome extension.</p>

<p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Chrome Web Store Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: * <br>(https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en)</a></p>

<p>Basically it's a little toggle switch to toggle on and off the Allow-Access-Origin-Control check. Works perfectly for me for what I'm doing.</p>

<p>Seems none of above solutions are actually working. The <strong>--disable-web-security</strong> is no longer supported in recent chrome versions. </p>

<p><strong>Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: * - chrome extension</strong> partially solved the problem. It works only if your request is using GET method and there's no custom HTTP Header. Otherwise, chrome will send OPTIONS HTTP request as a pre-flight request. If the server doesn't support CORS, it will respond with 404 HTTP status code. The plugin can't modify the response HTTP status code. So chrome will reject this request. There's no way for chrome plugin to modify the response HTTP status code based on current chrome extension API. And you can't do a redirect as well for XHR initiated request.</p>

<p>Not sure why Chrome makes developers life so difficult. It blocks all the possible ways to disable XSS security check even for development use which is totally unnecessary.</p>

<p>After days struggle and research, one solution works perfectly for me: to use <strong>corsproxy</strong>. You have two options here: 
1. use [<a href="https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/]" rel="noreferrer">https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/]</a>
2. install corsproxy in the local box: <strong>npm install -g corsproxy</strong></p>

<p><strong>[Updated on Jun 23, 2018]</strong> Recent I'm developing an SPA app which need to use corsproxy again. But seem none of the corsproxy on the github can meet my requirement. </p>

<ul>
<li>need it to run inside firewall for security reason. So I can't use <a href="https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/" rel="noreferrer">https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/</a>. </li>
<li>It has to support https as chrome will block no-https ajax request in an https page. </li>
<li>I need to run on nodejs. I don't want to maintain another language stack.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I decide to develop my own version of corsproxy with nodejs. It's actually very simple. I have published it as a gist on the github. Here is the source code gist: 
<a href="https://gist.github.com/jianwu/8e76eaec95d9b1300c59596fbfc21b10" rel="noreferrer">https://gist.github.com/jianwu/8e76eaec95d9b1300c59596fbfc21b10</a></p>

<ul>
<li>It's in plain nodejs code without any additional dependencies</li>
<li>You can run in http and https mode (by passing the https port
number in command line), to run https, you need to generate cert and
key and put them in the webroot directory. </li>
<li>It also serves as static file server</li>
<li>It supports pre-flight OPTION request as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>To start the CORSProxy server (http port 8080):
node static_server.js 8080</p>

<p>to access the proxy:
<a href="http://host:8080/http://www.somesite.com" rel="noreferrer">http://host:8080/http://www.somesite.com</a></p>

<p>People downvoting this answer should go over here and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/33801287/128511">downvote this one too</a> to be consistent. No idea why my answer is so downvoted and the same answer over <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/33801287/128511">here</a> is the top voted answer.</p>
<p>You <strong>are</strong> opening yourself to attacks. Every single 3rd party script you include on your site remotely or locally like via npm can now upload your data or steal your credentials. You are doing something you have no need to do. The suggested solution is not hard, takes 30 seconds, doesn't leave you open attack. Why would you choose to make yourself vulnerable when the better thing to do is so simple?</p>
<p>Telling people to disable security is like telling your friends to leave their front door unlocked and/or a key under the doormat. Sure the odds might be low but if they do get burgled, without proof of forced entry they might have a hard time collecting insurance. Similarly if you <strong>disable security</strong> you are doing just that <strong>disabling</strong> <strong>security</strong>. It's irresponsible to do this when you can solve the issue so simply without disabling security. I'd be surprised if you couldn't be fired at some companies for disabling security.</p>

Works perfectly for me for what I\u0026apos;m doing.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Seems none of above solutions are actually working. The \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;--disable-web-security\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; is no longer supported in recent chrome versions. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: * - chrome extension\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; partially solved the problem. It works only if your request is using GET method and there\u0026apos;s no custom HTTP Header. Otherwise, chrome will send OPTIONS HTTP request as a pre-flight request. If the server doesn\u0026apos;t support CORS, it will respond with 404 HTTP status code. The plugin can\u0026apos;t modify the response HTTP status code. So chrome will reject this request. There\u0026apos;s no way for chrome plugin to modify the response HTTP status code based on current chrome extension API. And you can\u0026apos;t do a redirect as well for XHR initiated request.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Not sure why Chrome makes developers life so difficult. It blocks all the possible ways to disable XSS security check even for development use which is totally unnecessary.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;After days struggle and research, one solution works perfectly for me: to use \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;corsproxy\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;. You have two options here: \n1. use [\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/]\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/]\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\n2. install corsproxy in the local box: \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;npm install -g corsproxy\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;[Updated on Jun 23, 2018]\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; Recent I\u0026apos;m developing an SPA app which need to use corsproxy again. But seem none of the corsproxy on the github can meet my requirement. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;need it to run inside firewall for security reason. So I can\u0026apos;t use \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;. \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;It has to support https as chrome will block no-https ajax request in an https page. \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;I need to run on nodejs.

Every single 3rd party script you include on your site remotely or locally like via npm can now upload your data or steal your credentials. You are doing something you have no need to do.

Why would you choose to make yourself vulnerable when the better thing to do is so simple?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Telling people to disable security is like telling your friends to leave their front door unlocked and/or a key under the doormat.
