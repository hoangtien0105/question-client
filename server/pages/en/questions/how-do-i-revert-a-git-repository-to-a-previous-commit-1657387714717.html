(If you&apos;ve made changes, as always when switching branches, you&apos;ll have to deal with them as appropriate. You could reset to throw them away; you could stash, checkout, stash pop to take them with you; you could commit them to a branch there if you want a branch there.)\nHard delete unpublished commits\nIf, on the other hand, you want to really get rid of everything you&apos;ve done since then, there are two possibilities. One, if you haven&apos;t published any of these commits, simply reset:\n# This will destroy any local modifications.\n# Don&apos;t do it if you have uncommitted work you want to keep.\ngit reset --hard 0d1d7fc32\n\n# Alternatively, if there&apos;s work to keep:\ngit stash\ngit reset --hard 0d1d7fc32\ngit stash pop\n# This saves the modifications, then reapplies that patch after resetting.\n# You could get merge conflicts, if you&apos;ve modified things which were\n# changed since the commit you reset to.\n\nIf you mess up, you&apos;ve already thrown away your local changes, but you can at least get back to where you were before by resetting again.\nUndo published commits with new commits\nOn the other hand, if you&apos;ve published the work, you probably don&apos;t want to reset the branch, since that&apos;s effectively rewriting history. In that case, you could indeed revert the commits. With Git, revert has a very specific meaning: create a commit with the reverse patch to cancel it out. This way you don&apos;t rewrite any history.\n# This will create three separate revert commits:\ngit revert a867b4af 25eee4ca 0766c053\n\n# It also takes ranges. This will revert the last two commits:\ngit revert HEAD~2..HEAD\n\n#Similarly, you can revert a range of commits using commit hashes (non inclusive of first hash):\ngit revert 0d1d7fc..a867b4a\n\n# Reverting a merge commit\ngit revert -m 1 &lt;merge_commit_sha&gt;\n\n# To get just one, you could use `rebase -i` to squash them afterwards\n# Or, you could do it manually (be sure to do this at top level of the repo)\n# get your index and work tree into the desired state, without changing HEAD:\ngit checkout 0d1d7fc32 .\n\n# Then commit. Be sure and write a good message describing what you just did\ngit commit\n\nThe git-revert manpage actually covers a lot of this in its description. Another useful link is this git-scm.com section discussing git-revert.\nIf you decide you didn&apos;t want to revert after all, you can revert the revert (as described here) or reset back to before the revert (see the previous section).\nYou may also find this answer helpful in this case:\nHow can I move HEAD back to a previous location?

You can then commit the current tree, and it will create a brand new commit essentially equivalent to the commit you &quot;reverted&quot; to.  \n\n(The --no-commit flag lets git revert all the commits at once- otherwise you&apos;ll be prompted for a message for each commit in the range, littering your history with unnecessary new commits.)\n\nThis is a safe and easy way to rollback to a previous state.

This command will checkout to a given commit.\nAt this point you can create a branch and start to work from this point on:\n# Checkout a given commit.\n# Doing so will result in a `detached HEAD` which mean that the `HEAD`\n# is not pointing to the latest so you will need to checkout branch\n# in order to be able to update the code.\ngit checkout &lt;commit-id&gt;\n\n# Create a new branch forked to the given commit\ngit checkout -b &lt;branch name&gt;\n\n\ngit reflog\nYou can always use the reflog as well. git reflog  will display any change which updated the HEAD and checking out the desired reflog entry will set the HEAD back to this commit.\nEvery time the HEAD is modified there will be a new entry in the reflog\ngit reflog\ngit checkout HEAD@{...}\n\nThis will get you back to your desired commit.\n\n\ngit reset HEAD --hard &lt;commit_id&gt;\n&quot;Move&quot; your HEAD back to the desired commit.\n# This will destroy any local modifications.\n# Don&apos;t do it if you have uncommitted work you want to keep.\ngit reset --hard 0d1d7fc32\n\n# Alternatively, if there&apos;s work to keep:\ngit stash\ngit reset --hard 0d1d7fc32\ngit stash pop\n# This saves the modifications, then reapplies that patch after resetting.\n# You could get merge conflicts, if you&apos;ve modified things which were\n# changed since the commit you reset to.\n\n\nNote: (Since Git 2.7) you can also use the git rebase --no-autostash as well.\n\n\nThis schema illustrates which command does what.

What my solution here does is NOT replace irreversibly the files you have in your working directory with files hauled up/extracted from the depths of the git repository lurking beneath your .git/ directory using fiendishly clever and diabolically powerful git commands, of which there are many. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO SUCH DEEP-SEA DIVING TO RECOVER what may appear to be a disastrous situation, and attempting to do so without sufficient expertise may prove fatal.\n\n\nCopy the whole directory and call it something else, like &quot;my project - copy&quot;. Assuming your git repository (&quot;repo&quot;) files are under the &quot;my project&quot; directory (the default place for them, under a directory called &quot;.git&quot;), you will now have copied both your work files and your repo files.\n\nDo this in the directory &quot;my project&quot;:\n .../my project $ git reset --hard [first-4-letters&amp;numbers-of-commit&apos;s-SHA]\n\n\n\nThis will return the state of the repo under &quot;my project&quot; to what it was when you made that commit (a &quot;commit&quot; means a snapshot of your working files). All commits since the &quot;resetted&quot; commit will be lost forever under &quot;my project&quot;, BUT... they will still be present in the repo under &quot;my project - copy&quot; since you copied all those files - including the ones in the repo, under .../.git/.\nYou then have two versions on your system... you can examine or copy or modify files of interest, or whatever, from the previous commit. You can completely discard the files under &quot;my project - copy&quot;, if you have decided the new work since the restored commit was going nowhere...\nThe obvious thing if you want to carry on with the state of the project without actually discarding the work since this retrieved commit is to rename your directory again: Delete the project containing the retrieved commit (or give it a temporary name) and rename your &quot;my project - copy&quot; directory back to &quot;my project&quot;. Then maybe try to understand some of the other answers here, and probably do another commit fairly soon.\nGit is a brilliant creation but absolutely no-one is able to just &quot;pick it up on the fly&quot;: also people who try to explain it far too often assume prior knowledge of other VCS [Version Control Systems] and delve far too deep far too soon, and commit other terrible crimes, like using interchangeable terms for &quot;checking out&quot; - in ways which sometimes appear almost calculated to confuse a beginner.\nTo save yourself much stress, learn from my scars. You have to pretty much have to read a book on Git - I&apos;d recommend reading THE BOOK, Pro Git 2nd edition: available for free download etc. from git central. Published 2014 but, as at early 2022, still the best. Do it sooner rather than later: Git is destined to be part of your life from now on. If you do, bear in mind that much of the complexity of Git comes from branching and then remerging: the Pro Git book actually introduces this central aspect very gently, but you can skip those parts in any book on your first read. From your question there&apos;s no reason why people should be blinding you with science.\nEspecially if, for example, this is a desperate situation and you&apos;re a newbie with Git!\nPS: (slight caution) One other thought: It is (now) actually quite simple to keep the Git repo in a directory other than the one with the working files. This would mean you would not copy the entire Git repository using the above quick &amp; dirty solution. See the answer by Fryer using --separate-git-dir here. Bearing that in mind, be warned: If you have a &quot;separate-directory&quot; repository which you don&apos;t copy, and you do a hard reset, all versions subsequent to the reset commit really will be lost forever forever, unless you have, as you absolutely should, regularly backed up your repository, preferably to the Cloud (e.g. Google Drive) among other places.\nOn this subject of &quot;backing up to the Cloud&quot;, the next step is to open an account (free of course) with GitHub or (better in my view) GitLab. You can then regularly do a git push command to make your Cloud repo up-to-date &quot;properly&quot;. But again, talking about this may be too much too soon: git push has to be configured, can fail to work for a totally baffling technical reason, involves learning about remote repos (&quot;origin&quot;, etc). So a quick-and-dirty Cloud-based backup approach may be preferable until you become knowledgeable. Again, the Pro Git book introduces how remote repositories work, and relate to your local repo, very gently and rationally.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution20","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Try resetting to the desired commit:\ngit reset &lt;COMMIT_ID&gt;\n\nTo check COMMIT_ID use:\ngit log\n\nThis will reset all changed files to un-added state.\nNow you can checkout all un-added files by\ngit checkout .\n\nTo verify your changes use:\ngit log\n\nUPDATE\nIf you have one and only commit in your repo, try\ngit update-ref -d HEAD\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution21","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Select your required commit, and check it by\n\ngit show HEAD\ngit show HEAD~1\ngit show HEAD~2 \n\n\ntill you get the required commit.

<p>This depends a lot on what you mean by "revert".</p>
<h2>Temporarily switch to a different commit</h2>
<p>If you want to temporarily go back to it, fool around, then come back to where you are, all you have to do is check out the desired commit:</p>
<pre class="lang-sh s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-comment"># This will detach your HEAD, that is, leave you with no branch checked out:</span>
git checkout 0d1d7fc32
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you want to make commits while you're there, go ahead and make a new branch while you're at it:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b old-state 0d1d7fc32
</code></pre>
<p>To go back to where you were, just check out the branch you were on again. (If you've made changes, as always when switching branches, you'll have to deal with them as appropriate. You could reset to throw them away; you could stash, checkout, stash pop to take them with you; you could commit them to a branch there if you want a branch there.)</p>
<h2>Hard delete unpublished commits</h2>
<p>If, on the other hand, you want to really get rid of everything you've done since then, there are two possibilities. One, if you haven't published any of these commits, simply reset:</p>
<pre class="lang-sh s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-comment"># This will destroy any local modifications.</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># Don't do it if you have uncommitted work you want to keep.</span>
git reset --hard 0d1d7fc32

<span class="hljs-comment"># Alternatively, if there's work to keep:</span>
git stash
git reset --hard 0d1d7fc32
git stash pop
<span class="hljs-comment"># This saves the modifications, then reapplies that patch after resetting.</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># You could get merge conflicts, if you've modified things which were</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># changed since the commit you reset to.</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If you mess up, you've already thrown away your local changes, but you can at least get back to where you were before by resetting again.</p>
<h2>Undo published commits with new commits</h2>
<p>On the other hand, if you've published the work, you probably don't want to reset the branch, since that's effectively rewriting history. In that case, you could indeed revert the commits. With Git, revert has a very specific meaning: create a commit with the reverse patch to cancel it out. This way you don't rewrite any history.</p>
<pre class="lang-sh s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-comment"># This will create three separate revert commits:</span>
git revert a867b4af 25eee4ca 0766c053

<span class="hljs-comment"># It also takes ranges. This will revert the last two commits:</span>
git revert HEAD~2..HEAD

<span class="hljs-comment">#Similarly, you can revert a range of commits using commit hashes (non inclusive of first hash):</span>
git revert 0d1d7fc..a867b4a

<span class="hljs-comment"># Reverting a merge commit</span>
git revert -m 1 &lt;merge_commit_sha&gt;

<span class="hljs-comment"># To get just one, you could use `rebase -i` to squash them afterwards</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># Or, you could do it manually (be sure to do this at top level of the repo)</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># get your index and work tree into the desired state, without changing HEAD:</span>
git checkout 0d1d7fc32 .

<span class="hljs-comment"># Then commit. Be sure and write a good message describing what you just did</span>
git commit

<p>Lots of complicated and dangerous answers here, but it's actually easy:</p>

<pre><code>git revert --no-commit 0766c053..HEAD
git commit
</code></pre>

<p>This will revert everything from the HEAD back to the commit hash, meaning it will recreate that commit state in the working tree <em>as if</em> every commit after <code>0766c053</code> had been walked back. You can then commit the current tree, and it will create a brand new commit essentially equivalent to the commit you "reverted" to.  </p>

<p>(The <code>--no-commit</code> flag lets git revert all the commits at once- otherwise you'll be prompted for a message for each commit in the range, littering your history with unnecessary new commits.)</p>

<p>This is a <strong>safe and easy way to rollback to a previous state</strong>. No history is destroyed, so it can be used for commits that have already been made public.</p>

<p>Before answering let's add some background, explaining what this <code>HEAD</code> is.</p>
<h1><em><strong>First of all what is HEAD?</strong></em></h1>
<p><code>HEAD</code> is simply a reference to the current commit (latest) on the current branch. There can only be a single <code>HEAD</code> at any given time (excluding <code>git worktree</code>).</p>
<p>The content of <code>HEAD</code> is stored inside <code>.git/HEAD</code>, and it contains the 40-bytes SHA-1 hash of the current commit.</p>
<hr>
<h1><em><strong><code>detached HEAD</code></strong></em></h1>
<p>If you are not on the latest commit - meaning that <code>HEAD</code> is pointing to a prior commit in history it's called <em><strong><code>detached HEAD</code></strong></em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OlavO.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OlavO.png" alt="Diagram illustrating the concept of detached HEAD"></a></p>
<p>On the command-line it will look like this - SHA-1 hash instead of the branch name since the <code>HEAD</code> is not pointing to the the tip of the current branch:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U0l3s.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/U0l3s.png" alt="Running git checkout HEAD^0 in a terminal"></a></p>
<hr>
<h3>A few options on how to recover from a detached HEAD:</h3>
<hr>
<h3><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout" rel="noreferrer"><code>git checkout</code></a></h3>
<pre><code>git checkout &lt;commit_id&gt;
git checkout -b &lt;new branch&gt; &lt;commit_id&gt;
git checkout HEAD~X // x is the number of commits t go back
</code></pre>
<p>This will checkout new branch pointing to the desired commit. This command will checkout to a given commit.</p>
<p>At this point you can create a branch and start to work from this point on:</p>
<pre><code># Checkout a given commit.
# Doing so will result in a `detached HEAD` which mean that the `HEAD`
# is not pointing to the latest so you will need to checkout branch
# in order to be able to update the code.
git checkout &lt;commit-id&gt;

# Create a new branch forked to the given commit
git checkout -b &lt;branch name&gt;
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h3><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog" rel="noreferrer"><code>git reflog</code></a></h3>
<p>You can always use the <code>reflog</code> as well. <code>git reflog </code> will display any change which updated the <code>HEAD</code> and checking out the desired reflog entry will set the <code>HEAD</code> back to this commit.</p>
<p><strong>Every time the HEAD is modified there will be a new entry in the <code>reflog</code></strong></p>
<pre><code>git reflog
git checkout HEAD@{...}
</code></pre>
<p>This will get you back to your desired commit.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/atW9w.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/atW9w.png" alt="Running git reflog in a terminal"></a></p>

<h3><em><strong><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reset" rel="noreferrer"><code>git reset HEAD --hard &lt;commit_id&gt;</code></a></strong></em></h3>
<p>"Move" your <code>HEAD</code> back to the desired commit.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>--soft</code> indicates that the uncommitted files should be retained as working files opposed to <code>--hard</code> which would discard them.</li>

<p>I have tried a lot of ways to revert local changes in Git, and it seems that this works the best if you just want to revert to the latest commit state. </p>

<pre><code>git add . &amp;&amp; git checkout master -f
</code></pre>

<p>Short description: </p>

<ul>
<li>It will NOT create any commits as <code>git revert</code> does.</li>
<li>It will NOT detach your HEAD like <code>git checkout &lt;commithashcode&gt;</code> does.</li>
<li>It WILL override all your local changes and DELETE all added files since the last commit in the branch.</li>
<li>It works only with branches names, so you can revert only to latest commit in the branch this way.</li>
</ul>

<p>I found a much more convenient and simple way to achieve the results above: </p>

<pre><code>git add . &amp;&amp; git reset --hard HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>where HEAD points to the latest commit at you current branch.</p>

<p>It is the same code code as boulder_ruby suggested, but I have added <code>git add .</code> before  <code>git reset --hard HEAD</code> to erase all new files created since the last commit since this is what most people expect I believe when reverting to the latest commit.</p>

<p><strong>OK,</strong> going back to a previous commit in Git is quite easy...</p>

<p>Revert back <strong>without keeping</strong> the changes:</p>

<pre><code>git reset --hard &lt;commit&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Revert back <strong>with keeping</strong> the changes:</p>

<pre><code>git reset --soft &lt;commit&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> using <code>git reset</code>, you can reset to a specific state. It's common using it with a commit hash as you see above.</p>

<p>But as you see the difference is using the two flags <code>--soft</code> and <code>--hard</code>, by default <code>git reset</code> using <code>--soft</code> flag, but it's a good practice always using the flag, I explain each flag:</p>

<hr>

<h2>--soft</h2>

<p>The default flag as explained, not need to provide it, does not change the working tree, but it adds all changed files ready to commit, so you go back to the commit status which changes to files get unstaged.</p>

<hr>

<h2>--hard</h2>

<p>Be careful with this flag. It resets the working tree and all changes to tracked files and all will be gone!</p>

<p>I found the answer from in a blog post (now no longer exists)</p>

<p>Note that this is Resetting and Forcing the change to the remote, so that if others on your team have already git pulled, you will cause problems for them. You are destroying the change history, which is an important reason why people use git in the first place.</p>

<p>Better to use revert (see other answers) than reset. 
If you're a one man team then it probably doesn't matter.</p>

<h2>Extra Alternatives to Jefromi's Solutions</h2>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4114122/456814">Jefromi's solutions</a> are definitely the best ones, and you should definitely use them. However, for the sake of completeness, I also wanted to show these other alternative solutions that can also be used to revert a commit (in the sense that you <strong>create a new commit that undoes changes in previous commit</strong>, just like what <code>git revert</code> does).</p>

<p>To be clear, these alternatives <strong><em>are not the best way to revert commits</em></strong>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4114122/456814">Jefromi's solutions are</a>, but I just want to point out that you can also use these other methods to achieve the same thing as <code>git revert</code>.</p>

<h2>Alternative 1: Hard and Soft Resets</h2>

<p>This is a very slightly modified version of Charles Bailey's solution to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1895059/revert-to-a-commit-by-sha-hash-in-git/1895095#1895095">Revert to a commit by a SHA hash in Git?</a>:</p>

<pre class="lang-bash s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-comment"># Reset the index to the desired commit</span>
git reset --hard &lt;commit&gt;

<span class="hljs-comment"># Move the branch pointer back to the previous HEAD</span>
git reset --soft HEAD@{1}

<span class="hljs-comment"># Commit the changes</span>
git commit -m <span class="hljs-string">"Revert to &lt;commit&gt;"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This basically works by using the fact that soft resets will leave the state of the previous commit staged in the index/staging-area, which you can then commit.</p>

<h2>Alternative 2: Delete the Current Tree and Replace with the New One</h2>

<p>This solution comes from svick's solution to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3380805/checkout-old-commit-and-make-it-a-new-commit/3382249#3382249">Checkout old commit and make it a new commit</a>:</p>

<pre><code>git rm -r .
git checkout &lt;commit&gt; .
git commit
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly to alternative #1, this reproduces the state of <code>&lt;commit&gt;</code> in the current working copy. It is necessary to do <code>git rm</code> first because <code>git checkout</code> won't remove files that have been added since <code>&lt;commit&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>This reverts everything back to the previous state, including file and directory creations, and deletions, commit it to your branch and you retain the history, but you have it reverted back to the same file structure.

<p>I have had a similar issue and wanted to revert back to an earlier commit. In my case I was not interested to keep the newer commit, hence I used <code>Hard</code>.</p>
<p>This is how I did it:</p>
<pre><code>git reset --hard CommitId &amp;&amp; git clean -f
</code></pre>
<p>This will revert on the local repository, and here after using <code>git push -f</code> will update the remote repository.</p>
<pre><code>git push -f
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>For instance, if you want to completely ignore the commit with the name <code>enforce non-group manage policies</code> from the next image</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JyrDu.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/JyrDu.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>you'd run</p>
<pre><code>git reset --hard dd52eb9 &amp;&amp; git clean -f

<p>followed by</p>
<pre><code>git push -f

<p>After, you won't see that commit (<code>enforce non-group manage policies</code>) there</p>

<p>This will return the state of the repo under "my project" to what it was when you made that commit (a "commit" means a snapshot of your working files). All commits since the "<code>reset</code>ted" commit will be lost forever under "my project", BUT... <strong>they will still be present</strong> in the repo under "my project - copy" since you copied <em>all</em> those files - including the ones in the repo, under .../.git/.</p>
<p>You then have two versions on your system... you can examine or copy or modify files of interest, or whatever, from the previous commit. You can completely discard the files under "my project - copy", if you have decided the new work since the restored commit was going nowhere...</p>
<p>The obvious thing if you want to carry on with the state of the project without actually discarding the work since this retrieved commit is to rename your directory again: Delete the project containing the retrieved commit (or give it a temporary name) and rename your "my project - copy" directory back to "my project". Then maybe try to understand some of the other answers here, and probably do another commit fairly soon.</p>
<p>Git is a brilliant creation but absolutely no-one is able to just "pick it up on the fly": also people who try to explain it <strong>far too often</strong> assume prior knowledge of other VCS [Version Control Systems] and delve far too deep far too soon, and commit other terrible crimes, like using interchangeable terms for "checking out" - in ways which sometimes appear almost calculated to confuse a beginner.</p>
<p>To save yourself much stress, learn from my scars. You have to pretty much have to read a book on Git - I'd recommend reading THE BOOK, <em>Pro Git 2nd edition</em>: available for free download etc. <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2" rel="noreferrer">from git central</a>. Published 2014 but, as at early 2022, still the best. Do it sooner rather than later: Git is destined to be part of your life from now on. If you do, bear in mind that much of the complexity of Git comes from branching and then remerging: the <em>Pro Git</em> book actually introduces this central aspect very gently, but you can skip those parts in any book on your first read. From your question there's <strong>no reason why people should be blinding you with science</strong>.</p>
<p>Especially if, for example, this is a desperate situation and you're a newbie with Git!</p>
<p>PS: (slight <strong>caution</strong>) One other thought: It is (now) actually quite simple to keep the Git repo in a directory other than the one with the working files. This would mean you would not copy the entire Git repository using the above quick &amp; dirty solution. See the answer by Fryer using <code>--separate-git-dir</code> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/505467/can-i-store-the-git-folder-outside-the-files-i-want-tracked">here</a>. Bearing that in mind, <strong>be warned</strong>: If you have a "separate-directory" repository which you don't copy, and you do a hard reset, all versions subsequent to the reset commit really will be lost <em>forever</em> forever, unless you have, as you absolutely should, regularly backed up your repository, preferably to the Cloud (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Drive" rel="noreferrer">Google Drive</a>) among other places.</p>
<p>On this subject of "backing up to the Cloud", the next step is to open an account (free of course) with GitHub or (better in my view) <a href="https://gitlab.com" rel="noreferrer">GitLab</a>. You can then regularly do a <code>git push</code> command to make your Cloud repo up-to-date "properly". But again, talking about this may be too much too soon: <code>git push</code> has to be configured, can fail to work for a totally baffling technical reason, involves learning about remote repos ("origin", etc). So a quick-and-dirty Cloud-based backup approach may be preferable until you become knowledgeable. Again, the <em>Pro Git</em> book introduces how remote repositories work, and relate to your local repo, very gently and rationally.</p>

<pre><code> git rm -r --cached . &amp;&amp; git clean -f -d

<p>At first I thought that <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/21718540/1788806">Yarins answer</a> would be the best, but it doesn't work for merge commits. This solution does.</p>
<p>Additionally it does not delete anything (pushed or upushed) from the history. It produces one clean commit which represents the state we want to revert back to.</p>

All commits since the \u0026quot;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;reset\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;ted\u0026quot; commit will be lost forever under \u0026quot;my project\u0026quot;, BUT... \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;they will still be present\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; in the repo under \u0026quot;my project - copy\u0026quot; since you copied \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;all\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; those files - including the ones in the repo, under .../.git/.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You then have two versions on your system... you can examine or copy or modify files of interest, or whatever, from the previous commit.

Then maybe try to understand some of the other answers here, and probably do another commit fairly soon.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Git is a brilliant creation but absolutely no-one is able to just \u0026quot;pick it up on the fly\u0026quot;: also people who try to explain it \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;far too often\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; assume prior knowledge of other VCS [Version Control Systems] and delve far too deep far too soon, and commit other terrible crimes, like using interchangeable terms for \u0026quot;checking out\u0026quot; - in ways which sometimes appear almost calculated to confuse a beginner.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;To save yourself much stress, learn from my scars. You have to pretty much have to read a book on Git - I\u0026apos;d recommend reading THE BOOK, \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;Pro Git 2nd edition\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;: available for free download etc. \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;from git central\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;. Published 2014 but, as at early 2022, still the best. Do it sooner rather than later: Git is destined to be part of your life from now on. If you do, bear in mind that much of the complexity of Git comes from branching and then remerging: the \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;Pro Git\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; book actually introduces this central aspect very gently, but you can skip those parts in any book on your first read. From your question there\u0026apos;s \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;no reason why people should be blinding you with science\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Especially if, for example, this is a desperate situation and you\u0026apos;re a newbie with Git!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;PS: (slight \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;caution\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;) One other thought: It is (now) actually quite simple to keep the Git repo in a directory other than the one with the working files. This would mean you would not copy the entire Git repository using the above quick \u0026amp;amp; dirty solution. See the answer by Fryer using \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;--separate-git-dir\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/505467/can-i-store-the-git-folder-outside-the-files-i-want-tracked\u0026quot;\u0026gt;here\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;. Bearing that in mind, \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;be warned\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;: If you have a \u0026quot;separate-directory\u0026quot; repository which you don\u0026apos;t copy, and you do a hard reset, all versions subsequent to the reset commit really will be lost \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;forever\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; forever, unless you have, as you absolutely should, regularly backed up your repository, preferably to the Cloud (e.g. \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Drive\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Google Drive\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;) among other places.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;On this subject of \u0026quot;backing up to the Cloud\u0026quot;, the next step is to open an account (free of course) with GitHub or (better in my view) \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://gitlab.com\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;GitLab\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;. You can then regularly do a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;git push\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; command to make your Cloud repo up-to-date \u0026quot;properly\u0026quot;. But again, talking about this may be too much too soon: \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;git push\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; has to be configured, can fail to work for a totally baffling technical reason, involves learning about remote repos (\u0026quot;origin\u0026quot;, etc). So a quick-and-dirty Cloud-based backup approach may be preferable until you become knowledgeable.
