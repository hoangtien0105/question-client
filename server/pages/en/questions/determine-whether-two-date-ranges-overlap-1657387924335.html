Thanks to @tomosius, a shorter version reads:\nDateRangesOverlap = max(start1, start2) &lt; min(end1, end2)\nThis is actually a syntactical shortcut for what is a longer implementation, which includes extra checks to verify that the start dates are on or before the endDates.  Deriving this from above:\nIf start and end dates can be out of order, i.e., if it is possible that startA &gt; endA or startB &gt; endB, then you also have to check that they are in order, so that means you have to add two additional validity rules:\n(StartA &lt;= EndB) and (StartB &lt;= EndA) and (StartA &lt;= EndA) and (StartB &lt;= EndB)\nor:\n(StartA &lt;= EndB) and (StartA &lt;= EndA) and (StartB &lt;= EndA) and (StartB &lt;= EndB)\nor,\n(StartA &lt;= Min(EndA, EndB) and (StartB &lt;= Min(EndA, EndB))\nor:\n(Max(StartA, StartB) &lt;= Min(EndA, EndB)\nBut to implement Min() and Max(), you have to code, (using C ternary for terseness),:\n(StartA &gt; StartB? Start A: StartB) &lt;= (EndA &lt; EndB? EndA: EndB)\nNOTE4.  Thanks to Carl for noticing this, but  another answer shows an equivalent mathematical expression for this logical expression. Because the product of any two real numbers with opposite sign is negative and with the same sign it is positive, if you convert the datetimes to fractional numbers (and most DBMSs internally use numbers to represent datetimes), the above logical expression can also be evaluated using the following mathematical expression:\n(EndA  - StartA) * (StartB - EndB) &lt;= 0\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I believe that it is sufficient to say that the two ranges overlap if:\n\n(StartDate1 &lt;= EndDate2) and (StartDate2 &lt;= EndDate1)\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"This article Time Period Library for .NET describes the relation of two time periods by the enumeration PeriodRelation:\n\n// ------------------------------------------------------------------------\npublic enum PeriodRelation\n{\n    After,\n    StartTouching,\n    StartInside,\n    InsideStartTouching,\n    EnclosingStartTouching,\n    Enclosing,\n    EnclosingEndTouching,\n    ExactMatch,\n    Inside,\n    InsideEndTouching,\n    EndInside,\n    EndTouching,\n    Before,\n} // enum PeriodRelation\n\n\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"For reasoning about temporal relations (or any other interval relations, come to that), consider Allen&apos;s Interval Algebra.

You can also find information about these operations in Snodgrass&apos;s Developing Time-Oriented Applications in SQL (PDF available online at URL), and in Date, Darwen and Lorentzos Temporal Data and the Relational Model (2002) or  Time and Relational Theory: Temporal Databases in the Relational Model and SQL (2014; effectively the second edition of TD&amp;RM).\n\n\n\nThe short(ish) answer is: given two date intervals A and B with components .start and .end and the constraint .start &lt;= .end, then two intervals overlap if:\n\nA.end &gt;= B.start AND A.start &lt;= B.end\n\n\nYou can tune the use of &gt;= vs &gt; and &lt;= vs &lt; to meet your requirements for degree of overlap.\n\n\n\nErikE comments:\n\n\n  You can only get 13 if you count things funny... I can get &quot;15 possible relations that two intervals can have&quot; when I go crazy with it. By sensible counting, I get only six, and if you throw out caring whether A or B comes first, I get only three (no intersect, partially intersect, one wholly within other). 15 goes like this: [before:before, start, within, end, after], [start:start, within, end, after], [within:within, end, after], [end:end, after], [after:after]. \n\n\nI think that you cannot count the two entries &apos;before:before&apos; and &apos;after:after&apos;.  I could see 7 entries if you equate some relations with their inverses (see the diagram in the referenced Wikipedia URL; it has 7 entries, 6 of which have a different inverse, with equals not having a distinct inverse).

You can do this by swapping the ranges if necessary up front.\nThen, you can detect overlap if the second range start is either:\n\nless than or equal to the first range end (if ranges are inclusive, containing both the start and end times); or\nless than (if ranges are inclusive of start and exclusive of end).\n\nFor example (assuming inclusive at both ends), there&apos;s only four possibilities for range 2of which one is a non-overlap (the &gt; at the end of the range means it doesn&apos;t matter where the range ends):\n|-----|        range 1, lines below are all range 2.\n|--&gt;  :        overlap.\n |--&gt; :        overlap.\n      |---&gt;    overlap (no overlap in exclusive-of-end case).\n       |---&gt;   no overlap.\n\nThe endpoint of the second range doesn&apos;t affect the result at all. So, in pseudo-code, you can do something like (assuming s &lt;= e within a given range):\ndef hasOverlap (r1, r2):\n    if r1.s &gt; r2.s: swap r1, r2\n    return r2.s &lt;= r1.e\n\nIf the ranges are exclusive at the end, you just have to replace &lt;= with &lt; in the expression you return.\nThis greatly limits the number of checks you have to make because you remove half of the problem space early by ensuring the first range never starts after the second.\n\nAnd, since &quot;code talks&quot;, here is some Python code that shows this in action, with quite a few test cases.

<p><strong>(StartA &lt;= EndB)  and  (EndA &gt;= StartB)</strong></p>
<p><em>Proof:</em><br>
Let ConditionA Mean that DateRange A Completely After DateRange B</p>
<pre><code>_                        |---- DateRange A ------|
|---Date Range B -----|                          _
</code></pre>
<p>(True if <code>StartA &gt; EndB</code>)</p>
<p>Let ConditionB Mean that DateRange A is Completely Before DateRange B</p>
<pre><code>|---- DateRange A -----|                        _ 
_                          |---Date Range B ----|
</code></pre>
<p>(True if <code>EndA &lt; StartB</code>)</p>
<p>Then Overlap exists if Neither A Nor B is true -<br>
(If one range is neither completely after the other,<br>
nor completely before the other,
then they must overlap.)</p>
<p>Now one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws" rel="noreferrer">De Morgan's laws</a> says that:</p>
<p><code>Not (A Or B)</code>  &lt;=&gt;  <code>Not A And Not B</code></p>
<p>Which translates to: <code>(StartA &lt;= EndB)  and  (EndA &gt;= StartB)</code></p>
<hr>
<p>NOTE: This includes conditions where the edges overlap exactly.  If you wish to exclude that,<br>
change the <code>&gt;=</code> operators to <code>&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;=</code>  to <code>&lt;</code></p>
<hr>
<p>NOTE2. Thanks to @Baodad, see <a href="http://baodad.blogspot.com/2014/06/date-range-overlap.html" rel="noreferrer">this blog</a>, the actual overlap is least of:<br>
{ <code>endA-startA</code>, <code>endA - startB</code>, <code>endB-startA</code>, <code>endB - startB</code> }</p>
<p><code>(StartA &lt;= EndB)  and  (EndA &gt;= StartB)</code>
<code>(StartA &lt;= EndB)  and  (StartB &lt;= EndA)</code></p>
<hr>
<p>NOTE3. Thanks to @tomosius, a shorter version reads:<br>
<code>DateRangesOverlap = max(start1, start2) &lt; min(end1, end2)</code><br>
This is actually a syntactical shortcut for what is a longer implementation, which includes extra checks to verify that the start dates are on or before the endDates.  Deriving this from above:</p>
<p>If start and end dates can be out of order, i.e., if it is possible that <code>startA &gt; endA</code> or <code>startB &gt; endB</code>, then you also have to check that they are in order, so that means you have to add two additional validity rules:<br>
<code>(StartA &lt;= EndB) and (StartB &lt;= EndA) and (StartA &lt;= EndA) and (StartB &lt;= EndB)</code>
or:<br>
<code>(StartA &lt;= EndB) and (StartA &lt;= EndA) and (StartB &lt;= EndA) and (StartB &lt;= EndB)</code>
or,<br>
<code>(StartA &lt;= Min(EndA, EndB) and (StartB &lt;= Min(EndA, EndB))</code>
or:<br>
<code>(Max(StartA, StartB) &lt;= Min(EndA, EndB)</code></p>
<p>But to implement <code>Min()</code> and <code>Max()</code>, you have to code, (using C ternary for terseness),:<br>
<code>(StartA &gt; StartB? Start A: StartB) &lt;= (EndA &lt; EndB? EndA: EndB)</code></p>
<p>NOTE4.  Thanks to Carl for noticing this, but  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27430253/find-if-given-date-range-inside-another-date-range-in-mysql/27430668#27430668">another answer</a> shows an equivalent mathematical expression for this logical expression. Because the product of any two real numbers with opposite sign is negative and with the same sign it is positive, if you convert the datetimes to fractional numbers (and most DBMSs internally use numbers to represent datetimes), the above logical expression can also be evaluated using the following mathematical expression:</p>
<pre><code>(EndA  - StartA) * (StartB - EndB) &lt;= 0

<p>For reasoning about temporal relations (or any other interval relations, come to that), consider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen%27s_Interval_Algebra" rel="noreferrer">Allen's Interval Algebra</a>.  It describes the 13 possible relations that two intervals can have with respect to each other.  You can find other references  "Allen Interval" seems to be an operative search term.  You can also find information about these operations in Snodgrass's <a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/~rts/publications.html" rel="noreferrer">Developing Time-Oriented Applications in SQL</a> (PDF available online at URL), and in Date, Darwen and Lorentzos <a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B005UY0W0E" rel="noreferrer">Temporal Data and the Relational Model</a> (2002) or  <a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B00N2SNSUG" rel="noreferrer">Time and Relational Theory: Temporal Databases in the Relational Model and SQL</a> (2014; effectively the second edition of TD&amp;RM).</p>

<hr>

<p>The short(ish) answer is: given two date intervals <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> with components <code>.start</code> and <code>.end</code> and the constraint <code>.start &lt;= .end</code>, then two intervals overlap if:</p>

<pre><code>A.end &gt;= B.start AND A.start &lt;= B.end
</code></pre>

<p>You can tune the use of <code>&gt;=</code> vs <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;=</code> vs <code>&lt;</code> to meet your requirements for degree of overlap.</p>

<hr>

<p>ErikE comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can only get 13 if you count things funny... I can get "15 possible relations that two intervals can have" when I go crazy with it. By sensible counting, I get only six, and if you throw out caring whether A or B comes first, I get only three (no intersect, partially intersect, one wholly within other). 15 goes like this: [before:before, start, within, end, after], [start:start, within, end, after], [within:within, end, after], [end:end, after], [after:after]. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that you cannot count the two entries 'before:before' and 'after:after'.  I could see 7 entries if you equate some relations with their inverses (see the diagram in the referenced Wikipedia URL; it has 7 entries, 6 of which have a different inverse, with equals not having a distinct inverse).  And whether three is sensible depends on your requirements.</p>

<p>All the solutions that check a multitude of conditions based on where the ranges are in relation to one another can be greatly simplified by <em><strong>simply ensuring that one range starts before or at the same time as the other.</strong></em> You can do this by swapping the ranges if necessary up front.</p>
<p>Then, you can detect overlap if the second range start is either:</p>
<ul>
<li>less than or equal to the first range end (if ranges are inclusive, containing both the start and end times); or</li>
<li>less than (if ranges are inclusive of start and exclusive of end).</li>
</ul>
<p>For example (assuming inclusive at both ends), there's only four possibilities for range 2of which <em>one</em> is a non-overlap (the <code>&gt;</code> at the end of the range means it doesn't matter where the range ends):</p>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>|-----|        range 1, lines below are all range 2.
|--&gt;  :        overlap.
 |--&gt; :        overlap.
      |---&gt;    overlap (no overlap in exclusive-of-end case).
       |---&gt;   no overlap.
</code></pre>
<p>The <em>endpoint</em> of the second range doesn't affect the result at all. So, in pseudo-code, you can do something like (assuming <code>s &lt;= e</code> within a given range):</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">hasOverlap</span> (r1, r2):
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> r1.s &gt; r2.s: swap r1, r2
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> r2.s &lt;= r1.e
</code></pre>
<p>If the ranges are <em>exclusive</em> at the end, you just have to replace <code>&lt;=</code> with <code>&lt;</code> in the expression you return.</p>
<p>This greatly limits the number of checks you have to make because you remove half of the problem space early by ensuring the first range never starts after the second.</p>
<hr>
<p>And, since "code talks", here is some Python code that shows this in action, with quite a few test cases. First, the <code>InclusiveRange</code> class:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">InclusiveRange</span>:
    <span class="hljs-string">"""InclusiveRange class to represent a lower and upper bound"""</span>

        <span class="hljs-string">"""Initialisation ensures start &lt;= end"""</span>
        self.start = <span class="hljs-built_in">min</span>(start, end)
        self.end = <span class="hljs-built_in">max</span>(start, end)

    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">__repr__</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self</span>):
        <span class="hljs-string">""" Return representation for f-string"""</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-string">f"(<span class="hljs-subst">{self.start}</span>, <span class="hljs-subst">{self.end}</span>)"</span>

    <span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">overlaps</span>(<span class="hljs-params">self, other</span>):
        <span class="hljs-string">"""True if range overlaps with another"""</span>

        <span class="hljs-comment"># Very limited recursion to ensure start of first range</span>
        <span class="hljs-comment"># isn't after start of second.</span>

        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> self.start &gt; other.start:
            <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> other.overlaps(self)

        <span class="hljs-comment"># Greatly simplified check for overlap.</span>

        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> other.start &lt;= self.end
</code></pre>
<p>Then a test case handler to allow us to nicely present the result of a <em>single</em> test case:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">test_case</span>(<span class="hljs-params">range1, range2</span>) -&gt; <span class="hljs-literal">None</span>:
    <span class="hljs-string">"""Single test case checker"""</span>

    <span class="hljs-comment"># Get low and high value for "graphic" output.</span>

    low = <span class="hljs-built_in">min</span>(range1.start, range2.start)
    high = <span class="hljs-built_in">max</span>(range1.end, range2.end)

    <span class="hljs-comment"># Output ranges and graphic.</span>

    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">f"r1=<span class="hljs-subst">{range1}</span> r2=<span class="hljs-subst">{range2}</span>: "</span>, end=<span class="hljs-string">""</span>)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> val <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">range</span>(low, high + <span class="hljs-number">1</span>):
        is_in_first = range1.start &lt;= val &lt;= range1.end
        is_in_second = range2.start &lt;= val &lt;= range2.end

        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> is_in_first <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> is_in_second:
            <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"|"</span>, end=<span class="hljs-string">""</span>)
        <span class="hljs-keyword">elif</span> is_in_first:
            <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"'"</span>, end=<span class="hljs-string">""</span>)
        <span class="hljs-keyword">elif</span> is_in_second:
            <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">","</span>, end=<span class="hljs-string">""</span>)
        <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
            <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">" "</span>, end=<span class="hljs-string">""</span>)

    <span class="hljs-comment"># Finally, output result of overlap check.</span>

    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">f" - <span class="hljs-subst">{range1.overlaps(range2)}</span>\n"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Then finally, a decent chunk of test cases to which you can add your own if need be:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-comment"># Various test cases, add others if you doubt the correctness.</span>

  <p>the simplest</p>

<p>The simplest way is to use a well-engineered dedicated library for date-time work.</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">someInterval.overlaps( anotherInterval )
</code></pre>

<h1>java.time &amp; ThreeTen-Extra</h1>

<p>The best in the business is the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>java.time</code></a> framework built into Java 8 and later. Add to that the <a href="http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ThreeTen-Extra</a> project that supplements java.time with additional classes, specifically the <a href="http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org/threeten/extra/Interval.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Interval</code></a> class we need here.</p>

<p>As for the <code>language-agnostic</code> tag on this Question, the source code for both projects is available for use in other languages (mind their licenses). </p>

<h2><code>Interval</code></h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.threeten.org/threeten-extra/apidocs/org/threeten/extra/Interval.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>org.threeten.extra.Interval</code></a> class is handy, but requires date-time moments (<code>java.time.Instant</code> objects) rather than date-only values. So we proceed by using the first moment of the day in UTC to represent the date.</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">Instant</span> <span class="hljs-variable">start</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> Instant.parse( <span class="hljs-string">"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z"</span> );
<span class="hljs-type">Instant</span> <span class="hljs-variable">stop</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> Instant.parse( <span class="hljs-string">"2016-02-01T00:00:00Z"</span> );
</code></pre>

<p>Create an <code>Interval</code> to represent that span of time.</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">Interval</span> <span class="hljs-variable">interval_A</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> Interval.of( start , stop );
</code></pre>

<p>We can also define an <code>Interval</code> with a starting moment plus a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Duration</code></a>.</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">Instant</span> <span class="hljs-variable">start_B</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> Instant.parse( <span class="hljs-string">"2016-01-03T00:00:00Z"</span> );
<span class="hljs-type">Interval</span> <span class="hljs-variable">interval_B</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> Interval.of( start_B , Duration.of( <span class="hljs-number">3</span> , ChronoUnit.DAYS ) );
</code></pre>

<p>Comparing to test for overlaps is easy.</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">Boolean</span> <span class="hljs-variable">overlaps</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> interval_A.overlaps( interval_B );

<p>I had a situation where we had dates instead of datetimes, and the dates could overlap only on start/end. Example below:</p>

<p>(Green is the current interval, blue blocks are valid intervals, red ones are overlapping intervals).</p>

<p>I adapted Ian Nelson's answer to the following solution:</p>

<pre><code>   (startB &lt;= startA &amp;&amp; endB &gt; startA)
|| (startB &gt;= startA &amp;&amp; startB &lt; endA)

<p>This matches all overlap cases but ignores the allowed overlap ones.</p>

<p>The mathematical solution given by @Bretana is good but neglects two specific details:</p>

<ol>
<li>aspect of closed or half-open intervals</li>
<li>empty intervals</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>About the closed or open state of interval boundaries, the solution of @Bretana valid <strong>for closed intervals</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(StartA &lt;= EndB)  and  (EndA &gt;= StartB)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>can be rewritten <strong>for half-open intervals</strong> to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(StartA &lt; EndB) and (EndA &gt; StartB)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This correction is necessary because an open interval boundary does not belong to the value range of an interval by definition.</p>

<hr>

<p>And about <strong>empty intervals</strong>, well, here the relationship shown above does NOT hold. Empty intervals which do not contain any valid value by definition must be handled as special case. I demonstrate it by my Java time library <a href="https://github.com/MenoData/Time4J" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Time4J</a> via this example:</p>

<pre><code>MomentInterval a = MomentInterval.between(Instant.now(), Instant.now().plusSeconds(2));
MomentInterval b = a.collapse(); // make b an empty interval out of a

System.out.println(a); // [2017-04-10T05:28:11,909000000Z/2017-04-10T05:28:13,909000000Z)
System.out.println(b); // [2017-04-10T05:28:11,909000000Z/2017-04-10T05:28:11,909000000Z)
</code></pre>

<p>The leading square bracket "[" indicates a closed start while the last bracket ")" indicates an open end.</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println(
      "startA &lt; endB: " + a.getStartAsInstant().isBefore(b.getEndAsInstant())); // false

System.out.println("a overlaps b: " + a.intersects(b)); // a overlaps b: false
</code></pre>

<p>As shown above, empty intervals violate the overlap condition above (especially startA &lt; endB), so Time4J (and other libraries, too) has to handle it as special edge case in order to guarantee that the overlap of any arbitrary interval with an empty interval does not exist. Of course, date intervals (which are closed by default in Time4J but can be half-open, too, like empty date intervals) are handled in a similar way.</p>

<p>This is an extension to the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/325964/2314737">excellent answer</a> by @charles-bretana.</p>

<p>The answer however does not make a distinction among open, closed, and half-open (or half-closed) intervals.</p>

<p><strong>Case 1</strong>: A, B are closed intervals</p>

<pre><code>A = [StartA, EndA]
B = [StartB, EndB]

                         [---- DateRange A ------]   (True if StartA &gt; EndB)
[--- Date Range B -----]                           


[---- DateRange A -----]                             (True if EndA &lt; StartB)
                         [--- Date Range B ----]
</code></pre>

<p>Overlap iff: <code>(StartA &lt;= EndB)  and  (EndA &gt;= StartB)</code></p>

<p><strong>Case 2</strong>: A, B are open intervals</p>

<pre><code>A = (StartA, EndA)
B = (StartB, EndB)

                         (---- DateRange A ------)   (True if StartA &gt;= EndB)
(--- Date Range B -----)                           

(---- DateRange A -----)                             (True if EndA &lt;= StartB)
                         (--- Date Range B ----)
</code></pre>

<p>Overlap iff: <code>(StartA &lt; EndB)  and  (EndA &gt; StartB)</code></p>

<p><strong>Case 3</strong>: A, B right open </p>

<pre><code>A = [StartA, EndA)
B = [StartB, EndB)

                         [---- DateRange A ------)   (True if StartA &gt;= EndB) 
[--- Date Range B -----)                           

[---- DateRange A -----)                             (True if EndA &lt;= StartB)
                         [--- Date Range B ----)
</code></pre>

<p>Overlap condition: <code>(StartA &lt; EndB)  and  (EndA &gt; StartB)</code></p>

<p><strong>Case 4</strong>: A, B left open</p>

<pre><code>A = (StartA, EndA]
B = (StartB, EndB]

                         (---- DateRange A ------]   (True if StartA &gt;= EndB)
(--- Date Range B -----]                           

(---- DateRange A -----]                             (True if EndA &lt;= StartB)
                         (--- Date Range B ----]
</code></pre>

<p>Overlap condition: <code>(StartA &lt; EndB)  and  (EndA &gt; StartB)</code></p>

<p><strong>Case 5</strong>: A right open, B closed</p>

<pre><code>A = [StartA, EndA)
B = [StartB, EndB]

                         [---- DateRange A ------)    (True if StartA &gt; EndB)
[--- Date Range B -----]                           


[---- DateRange A -----)                              (True if EndA &lt;= StartB)  
                         [--- Date Range B ----]
</code></pre>

<p>Overlap condition: <code>(StartA &lt;= EndB)  and  (EndA &gt; StartB)</code></p>

<p><strong>etc...</strong></p>

<p>Finally, the general condition for two intervals to overlap is </p>

<p><strong>(StartA &lt; EndB)  and  (EndA &gt; StartB)</strong></p>

<p>where  turns a strict inequality into a non-strict one whenever the comparison is made between two included endpoint.</p>

<p>In case you're using a date range that has not ended yet (still on going) e.g. not set 
endDate = '0000-00-00' you can not use BETWEEN because 0000-00-00 is not a valid date!</p>

<p>I used this solution:</p>

<pre><code>(Startdate BETWEEN '".$startdate2."' AND '".$enddate2."')  //overlap: starts between start2/end2
OR (Startdate &lt; '".$startdate2."' 
  AND (enddate = '0000-00-00' OR enddate &gt;= '".$startdate2."')
) //overlap: starts before start2 and enddate not set 0000-00-00 (still on going) or if enddate is set but higher then startdate2
</code></pre>

<p>If startdate2 is higher then enddate there is no overlap!</p>

<p>The answer is too simple for me so I have created a more generic dynamic SQL statement which checks to see if a person has any overlapping dates.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT T1.EmpID

INNER JOIN Table2 T2 ON T1.EmpID = T2.EmpID 
    AND T1.JobID &lt;&gt; T2.JobID

        OR (T1.DateTo &gt;= T2.DateFrom AND T1.DateTo &lt;= T2.DateTo)
        OR (T1.DateFrom &lt; T2.DateFrom AND T1.DateTo IS NULL)
    )
    AND NOT (T1.DateFrom = T2.DateFrom)

  named_scope :overlapping, lambda { |interval| {

<p>The easiest way to do it in my opinion would be to compare if either EndDate1 is before StartDate2 and EndDate2 is before StartDate1.</p>

<p>That of course if you are considering intervals where StartDate is always before EndDate.</p>

<p>If you provide a date range as input and want to find out if it overlaps with the existing date range in database, the following conditions can successfully meet your demand</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assume you provide a <code>@StartDate</code> and <code>@EndDate</code> from your form input.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>conditions are :</strong></p>
<p>If <code>@StartDate</code> is ahead of <code>existingStartDate</code> and behind <code>existingEndDate</code> then we can say <code>@StartDate</code> is in the middle of a existing date range, thus we can conclude it will overlap</p>
<pre><code>@StartDate &gt;=existing.StartDate And @StartDate &lt;= existing.EndDate)
