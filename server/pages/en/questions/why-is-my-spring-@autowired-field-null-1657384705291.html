I have a Spring @Service class (MileageFeeCalculator) that has an @Autowired field (rateService), but the field is null when I try to use it. The logs show that both the MileageFeeCalculator bean and the MileageRateService bean are being created, but I get a NullPointerException whenever I try to call the mileageCharge method on my service bean. Why isn&#x27;t Spring autowiring the field?

    @Autowired
    private MileageRateService rateService; // &lt;--- should be autowired, is null

    public float mileageCharge(final int miles) {

When you call new, the JVM instantiates a copy of the new object and hands it straight to you--it never goes through the configuration process. There are three ways that you can get your beans configured.\n\nI have posted all of this code, using Spring Boot to launch, at this GitHub project; you can look at a full running project for each approach to see everything you need to make it work. Tag with the NullPointerException: nonworking\n\nInject your beans\n\nThe most preferable option is to let Spring autowire all of your beans; this requires the least amount of code and is the most maintainable. To make the autowiring work like you wanted, also autowire the MileageFeeCalculator like this:\n\n@Controller\npublic class MileageFeeController {\n\n    @Autowired\n    private MileageFeeCalculator calc;\n\n    @RequestMapping(&quot;/mileage/{miles}&quot;)\n    @ResponseBody\n    public float mileageFee(@PathVariable int miles) {\n        return calc.mileageCharge(miles);\n    }\n}\n\n\nIf you need to create a new instance of your service object for different requests, you can still use injection by using the Spring bean scopes.\n\nTag that works by injecting the @MileageFeeCalculator service object: working-inject-bean\n\nUse @Configurable\n\nIf you really need objects created with new to be autowired, you can use the Spring @Configurable annotation along with AspectJ compile-time weaving to inject your objects. This approach inserts code into your object&apos;s constructor that alerts Spring that it&apos;s being created so that Spring can configure the new instance. This requires a bit of configuration in your build (such as compiling with ajc) and turning on Spring&apos;s runtime configuration handlers (@EnableSpringConfigured with the JavaConfig syntax). This approach is used by the Roo Active Record system to allow new instances of your entities to get the necessary persistence information injected.\n\n@Service\n@Configurable\npublic class MileageFeeCalculator {\n\n    @Autowired\n    private MileageRateService rateService;\n\n    public float mileageCharge(final int miles) {\n        return (miles * rateService.ratePerMile());\n    }\n}\n\n\nTag that works by using @Configurable on the service object: working-configurable\n\nManual bean lookup: not recommended\n\nThis approach is suitable only for interfacing with legacy code in special situations. It is nearly always preferable to create a singleton adapter class that Spring can autowire and the legacy code can call, but it is possible to directly ask the Spring application context for a bean.\n\nTo do this, you need a class to which Spring can give a reference to the ApplicationContext object:\n\n@Component\npublic class ApplicationContextHolder implements ApplicationContextAware {\n    private static ApplicationContext context;\n\n    @Override\n    public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) throws BeansException {\n        context = applicationContext;   \n    }\n\n    public static ApplicationContext getContext() {\n        return context;\n    }\n}\n\n\nThen your legacy code can call getContext() and retrieve the beans it needs:\n\n@Controller\npublic class MileageFeeController {    \n    @RequestMapping(&quot;/mileage/{miles}&quot;)\n    @ResponseBody\n    public float mileageFee(@PathVariable int miles) {\n        MileageFeeCalculator calc = ApplicationContextHolder.getContext().getBean(MileageFeeCalculator.class);\n        return calc.mileageCharge(miles);\n    }\n}\n\n\nTag that works by manually looking up the service object in the Spring context: working-manual-lookup\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/why-is-my-spring-@autowired-field-null-1657384705291#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"If you are not coding a web application, make sure your class in which @Autowiring is done is a spring bean.

<p><em>Note: This is intended to be a canonical answer for a common problem.</em></p>

<p>I have a Spring <code>@Service</code> class (<code>MileageFeeCalculator</code>) that has an <code>@Autowired</code> field (<code>rateService</code>), but the field is <code>null</code> when I try to use it. The logs show that both the <code>MileageFeeCalculator</code> bean and the <code>MileageRateService</code> bean are being created, but I get a <code>NullPointerException</code> whenever I try to call the <code>mileageCharge</code> method on my service bean. Why isn't Spring autowiring the field?</p>

<p>The field annotated <code>@Autowired</code> is <code>null</code> because Spring doesn't know about the copy of <code>MileageFeeCalculator</code> that you created with <code>new</code> and didn't know to autowire it.</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html">The Spring Inversion of Control (IoC) container</a> has three main logical components: a registry (called the <code>ApplicationContext</code>) of components (beans) that are available to be used by the application, a configurer system that injects objects' dependencies into them by matching up the dependencies with beans in the context, and a dependency solver that can look at a configuration of many different beans and determine how to instantiate and configure them in the necessary order.</p>

<p>The IoC container isn't magic, and it has no way of knowing about Java objects unless you somehow inform it of them. When you call <code>new</code>, the JVM instantiates a copy of the new object and hands it straight to you--it never goes through the configuration process. There are three ways that you can get your beans configured.</p>

<p>I have posted all of this code, using Spring Boot to launch, at <a href="https://github.com/chrylis/spring_autowired_npe_example">this GitHub project</a>; you can look at a full running project for each approach to see everything you need to make it work. <strong>Tag with the <code>NullPointerException</code>: <a href="https://github.com/chrylis/spring_autowired_npe_example/tree/nonworking"><code>nonworking</code></a></strong></p>

<h2>Inject your beans</h2>

<p>The most preferable option is to let Spring autowire all of your beans; this requires the least amount of code and is the most maintainable. To make the autowiring work like you wanted, also autowire the <code>MileageFeeCalculator</code> like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-meta">@Controller</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">MileageFeeController</span> {

    <span class="hljs-meta">@Autowired</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> MileageFeeCalculator calc;

    <span class="hljs-meta">@RequestMapping("/mileage/{miles}")</span>
    <span class="hljs-meta">@ResponseBody</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-type">float</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">mileageFee</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-meta">@PathVariable</span> <span class="hljs-type">int</span> miles)</span> {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> calc.mileageCharge(miles);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to create a new instance of your service object for different requests, you can still use injection by using <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-factory-scopes">the Spring bean scopes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Tag that works by injecting the <code>@MileageFeeCalculator</code> service object: <a href="https://github.com/chrylis/spring_autowired_npe_example/tree/working-inject-bean"><code>working-inject-bean</code></a></strong></p>

<h2>Use @Configurable</h2>

<p>If you really need objects created with <code>new</code> to be autowired, you can <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/aop.html#aop-atconfigurable">use the Spring <code>@Configurable</code> annotation along with AspectJ compile-time weaving</a> to inject your objects. This approach inserts code into your object's constructor that alerts Spring that it's being created so that Spring can configure the new instance. This requires a bit of configuration in your build (such as compiling with <code>ajc</code>) and turning on Spring's runtime configuration handlers (<code>@EnableSpringConfigured</code> with the JavaConfig syntax). This approach is used by the Roo Active Record system to allow <code>new</code> instances of your entities to get the necessary persistence information injected.</p>

<h2>Manual bean lookup: not recommended</h2>

<p>This approach is suitable only for interfacing with legacy code in special situations. It is nearly always preferable to create a singleton adapter class that Spring can autowire and the legacy code can call, but it is possible to directly ask the Spring application context for a bean.</p>

<p>To do this, you need a class to which Spring can give a reference to the <code>ApplicationContext</code> object:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-meta">@Component</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">ApplicationContextHolder</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">implements</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">ApplicationContextAware</span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> ApplicationContext context;

    <span class="hljs-meta">@Override</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">setApplicationContext</span><span class="hljs-params">(ApplicationContext applicationContext)</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">throws</span> BeansException {
        context = applicationContext;   
    }

    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> ApplicationContext <span class="hljs-title function_">getContext</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> context;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then your legacy code can call <code>getContext()</code> and retrieve the beans it needs:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-meta">@Controller</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">MileageFeeController</span> {    
    <span class="hljs-meta">@RequestMapping("/mileage/{miles}")</span>
    <span class="hljs-meta">@ResponseBody</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-type">float</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">mileageFee</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-meta">@PathVariable</span> <span class="hljs-type">int</span> miles)</span> {
        <span class="hljs-type">MileageFeeCalculator</span> <span class="hljs-variable">calc</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> ApplicationContextHolder.getContext().getBean(MileageFeeCalculator.class);
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> calc.mileageCharge(miles);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you are not coding a web application, make sure your class in which @Autowiring is done is a spring bean. Typically, spring container won't be aware of the class which we might think of as a spring bean. We have to tell the Spring container about our spring classes.</p>

<p>This can be achieved by configuring in appln-contxt or <strong>the better way</strong> is to annotate class as <strong>@Component</strong> and please do not create the annotated class using new operator.

<p>It seems to be rare case but here is what happened to me:</p>

<p>We used <code>@Inject</code> instead of <code>@Autowired</code> which is javaee standard supported by Spring. Every places it worked fine and the beans injected correctly, instead of one place. The bean injection seems the same</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-meta">@Inject</span>

<p>At last we found that the error was that we (actually, the Eclipse auto complete feature) imported <code>com.opensymphony.xwork2.Inject</code> instead of <code>javax.inject.Inject</code> !</p>

<p><em>I'm new to Spring, but I discovered this working solution. Please tell me if it's a deprecable way.</em></p>

    <span class="hljs-comment">/**

<p>You can put this code also in the main application class if you want.</p>

<p>Other classes can use it like this:</p>

<h2>Some time elapses...</h2>

<p>Spring Boot <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2016/04/15/testing-improvements-in-spring-boot-1-4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">continues to evolve</a>.  It is no longer required to use <code>@RunWith</code> <em>if you use the correct version of JUnit</em>.</p>

<p>For <code>@SpringBootTest</code> to work stand alone, you need to use <code>@Test</code> from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/48853312">JUnit5 instead of JUnit4</a>.</p>

<p>If you get this configuration wrong your tests will compile, but <code>@Autowired</code> and <code>@Value</code> fields (for example) will be <code>null</code>.  Since Spring Boot operates by magic, you may have few avenues for directly debugging this failure.</p>

<p>I think you have missed to instruct spring to scan classes with annotation. </p>

<p>You can use <code>@ComponentScan("packageToScan")</code> on the configuration class of your spring application to instruct spring to scan.</p>

<p><code>@Service, @Component</code> etc annotations add meta description.
<br> </p>

<p>Spring only injects instances of those classes which are either created as bean or marked with annotation.</p>

<p>Classes marked with annotation need to be identified by spring before injecting, <code>@ComponentScan</code> instruct spring look for the classes marked with annotation. When Spring finds <code>@Autowired</code> it searches for the related bean, and injects the required instance.</p>

<p>Adding annotation only, does not fix or facilitate the dependency injection, Spring needs to know where to look for.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Really smart people were quick to point on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/13177782/2583044">this</a> answer, which explains the weirdness, described below</p>

<p><strong>ORIGINAL ANSWER:</strong></p>

<p>I don't know if it helps anyone, but I was stuck with the same problem even while doing things seemingly right. In my Main method, I have a code like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">ApplicationContext</span> <span class="hljs-variable">context</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">ClassPathXmlApplicationContext</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>[] {
        <span class="hljs-string">"common.xml"</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">"token.xml"</span>,
        <span class="hljs-string">"pep-config.xml"</span> });
    <span class="hljs-type">TokenInitializer</span> <span class="hljs-variable">ti</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> context.getBean(TokenInitializer.class);
</code></pre>

<p>and in a <code>token.xml</code> file I've had a line</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">&lt;context:component-scan base-<span class="hljs-keyword">package</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"package.path"</span>/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I noticed that the package.path does no longer exist, so I've just dropped the line for good. </p>

<p>And after that, NPE started coming in. In a <code>pep-config.xml</code> I had just 2 beans: </p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">&lt;bean id=<span class="hljs-string">"someAbac"</span> class=<span class="hljs-string">"com.pep.SomeAbac"</span> init-method=<span class="hljs-string">"init"</span>/&gt;
&lt;bean id=<span class="hljs-string">"settings"</span> class=<span class="hljs-string">"com.pep.Settings"</span>/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and SomeAbac class has a property declared as</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-meta">@Autowired</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> Settings settings;
</code></pre>

<p>for some unknown reason, settings is <em>null</em> in init(), when <code>&lt;context:component-scan/&gt;</code> element is not present at all, but when it's present and has some bs as a basePackage, everything works well. This line now looks like this: </p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">&lt;context:component-scan base-<span class="hljs-keyword">package</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"some.shit"</span>/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and it works. May be someone can provide an explanation, but for me it's enough right now )</p>

<p>You can also fix this issue using @Service annotation on service class and passing the required bean classA as a parameter to the other beans classB constructor and annotate the constructor of classB with @Autowired. Sample snippet here :</p>

    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">ClassB</span><span class="hljs-params">(ClassA classA)</span> {
        <span class="hljs-built_in">this</span>.classA = classA;

<p>This is only valid in case of Unit test.</p>

<p>My Service class had an annotation of service and it was <code>@autowired</code> another component class. When I tested the component class was coming null. Because for service class I was creating the object using <code>new</code></p>

<p>If you are writing unit test make sure you are not creating object using <code>new object()</code>. Use instead injectMock.</p>

<p>This fixed my issue. Here is a useful <a href="https://www.moreofless.co.uk/spring-mvc-java-autowired-component-null-repository-service/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a></p>
