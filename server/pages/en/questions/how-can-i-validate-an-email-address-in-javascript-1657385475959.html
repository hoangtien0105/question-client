An article with the best solution I&apos;ve found in PHP is What is a valid email address?. Obviously, it has been ported to Java. I think the function is too complex to be ported and used in JavaScript. JavaScript/node.js port: https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-addresses.\n\nA good practice is to validate your data on the client, but double-check the validation on the server. With this in mind, you can simply check whether a string looks like a valid email address on the client and perform the strict check on the server.\n\nHere&apos;s the JavaScript function I use to check if a string looks like a valid mail address:\n\nfunction looksLikeMail(str) {\n    var lastAtPos = str.lastIndexOf(&apos;@&apos;);\n    var lastDotPos = str.lastIndexOf(&apos;.&apos;);\n    return (lastAtPos &lt; lastDotPos &amp;&amp; lastAtPos &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; str.indexOf(&apos;@@&apos;) == -1 &amp;&amp; lastDotPos &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; (str.length - lastDotPos) &gt; 2);\n}\n\n\nExplanation:\n\n\nlastAtPos &lt; lastDotPos: Last @ should be before last . since @ cannot be part of server name (as far as I know).\nlastAtPos &gt; 0: There should be something (the email username) before the last @.\nstr.indexOf(&apos;@@&apos;) == -1: There should be no @@ in the address. Even if @ appears as the last character in email username, it has to be quoted so &quot; would be between that @ and the last @ in the address.\nlastDotPos &gt; 2: There should be at least three characters before the last dot, for example a@b.com.\n(str.length - lastDotPos) &gt; 2: There should be enough characters after the last dot to form a two-character domain.

<p>Just for completeness, <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html" rel="noreferrer">here you have another RFC 2822 compliant regex</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The official standard is known as <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2822#section-3.4.1" rel="noreferrer">RFC 2822</a>. It describes the syntax that valid email addresses must adhere to. You can (<strong>but you shouldn't</strong>  <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html" rel="noreferrer">read on</a>) implement it with this regular expression:</p>
<p><code>(?:[a-z0-9!#$%&amp;'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&amp;'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*|"(?:[\x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21\x23-\x5b\x5d-\x7f]|\\[\x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7f])*")@(?:(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?|\[(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?|[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]:(?:[\x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21-\x5a\x53-\x7f]|\\[\x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7f])+)\])</code></p>
<p>(...) We get a more practical implementation of RFC 2822 if we omit the syntax using double quotes and square brackets. <strong>It will still match 99.99% of all email addresses in actual use today.</strong></p>
<p><code>[a-z0-9!#$%&amp;'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&amp;'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?</code></p>
<p>A further change you could make is to allow any two-letter country code top level domain, and only specific generic top level domains. <strong>This regex filters dummy email addresses like <code>asdf@adsf.adsf</code></strong>. You <strong>will need to update it as new top-level domains are added</strong>.</p>
<p><code>[a-z0-9!#$%&amp;'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&amp;'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+(?:[A-Z]{2}|com|org|net|gov|mil|biz|info|mobi|name|aero|jobs|museum)\b</code></p>
<p>So even when following official standards, there are still trade-offs to be made. <em><strong>Don't blindly copy regular expressions from online libraries or discussion forums. Always test them on your own data and with your own applications.</strong></em></p>

<p>Wow, there are lots of complexity here. If all you want to do is just catch the most obvious syntax errors, I would do something like this:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-ruby">^\S+@\S+<span class="hljs-variable">$
</span></code></pre>
<p>It usually catches the most obvious errors that the user makes and assures that the form is mostly right, which is what JavaScript validation is all about.</p>

We can also check for '.' in the email using</p>

<p>There's something you have to understand the second you decide to use a regular expression to validate emails: <a href="http://ex-parrot.com/~pdw/Mail-RFC822-Address.html" rel="noreferrer">It's probably not a good idea</a>. Once you have come to terms with that, there are many implementations out there that can get you halfway there, <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html" rel="noreferrer">this article sums them up nicely.</a></p>

<p>In short, however, the only way to be absolutely, positively sure that what the user entered is in fact an email is to actually send an email and see what happens. Other than that it's all just guesses.</p>

<p>Correct validation of email address in compliance with the RFCs is not something that can be achieved with a one-liner regular expression. An article with the best solution I've found in PHP is <em><a href="http://www.dominicsayers.com/isemail/" rel="noreferrer">What is a valid email address?</a></em>. Obviously, it has been ported to Java. <strike>I think the function is too complex to be ported and used in JavaScript.</strike> JavaScript/node.js port: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-addresses" rel="noreferrer">https://www.npmjs.com/package/email-addresses</a>.</p>

<p>A good practice is to validate your data on the client, but double-check the validation on the server. With this in mind, you can simply check whether a string looks like a valid email address on the client and perform the strict check on the server.</p>

<p>Here's the JavaScript function I use to check if a string looks like a valid mail address:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">function looksLikeMail(<span class="hljs-built_in">str</span>) {
    var lastAtPos = <span class="hljs-built_in">str</span>.lastIndexOf(<span class="hljs-string">'@'</span>);
    var lastDotPos = <span class="hljs-built_in">str</span>.lastIndexOf(<span class="hljs-string">'.'</span>);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> (lastAtPos &lt; lastDotPos &amp;&amp; lastAtPos &gt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span> &amp;&amp; <span class="hljs-built_in">str</span>.indexOf(<span class="hljs-string">'@@'</span>) == -<span class="hljs-number">1</span> &amp;&amp; lastDotPos &gt; <span class="hljs-number">2</span> &amp;&amp; (<span class="hljs-built_in">str</span>.length - lastDotPos) &gt; <span class="hljs-number">2</span>);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Explanation:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>lastAtPos &lt; lastDotPos</code>: Last <code>@</code> should be before last <code>.</code> since <code>@</code> cannot be part of server name (as far as I know).</p></li>
<li><p><code>lastAtPos &gt; 0</code>: There should be something (the email username) before the last <code>@</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>str.indexOf('@@') == -1</code>: There should be no <code>@@</code> in the address. Even if <code>@</code> appears as the last character in email username, it has to be quoted so <code>"</code> would be between that <code>@</code> and the last <code>@</code> in the address.</p></li>
<li><p><code>lastDotPos &gt; 2</code>: There should be at least three characters before the last dot, for example <code>a@b.com</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>(str.length - lastDotPos) &gt; 2</code>: There should be enough characters after the last dot to form a two-character domain. I'm not sure if the brackets are necessary.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Often when storing email addresses in the database I make them lowercase and, in practice, regexs can usually be marked case insensitive. In those cases this is slightly shorter:</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>Here's an example of it being used in JavaScript (with the case insensitive flag <code>i</code> at the end).</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> emailCheck=<span class="hljs-regexp">/^[a-z0-9!#$%&amp;'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&amp;'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?$/i</span>;

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>:<br>
Technically some emails can include quotes in the section before the <code>@</code> symbol with escape characters inside the quotes (so your email user can be obnoxious and contain stuff like <code>@</code> and <code>"..."</code> as long as it's written in quotes). NOBODY DOES THIS EVER! It's obsolete. But, it IS included in the true <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt" rel="noreferrer">RFC 2822</a> standard and omitted here.</p>
<p><strong>Note 2</strong>:
The beginning of an email (before the @ sign) <em>can</em> be case sensitive (via the spec). However, anyone with a case-sensitive email is probably used to having issues, and, in practice, case insensitive is a safe assumption.

<p>You should not use regular expressions to validate an input string to check if it's an email. It's too complicated and would not cover all the cases.</p>

<p>Now since you can only cover 90% of the cases, write something like:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-matlab"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">isPossiblyValidEmail</span><span class="hljs-params">(txt)</span> {</span>

}
</code></pre>

<p>You can refine it. For instance, 'aaa@' is valid. But overall you get the gist. And don't get carried away... A simple 90% solution is better than 100% solution that does not work. </p>

<p>The world needs simpler code...</p>

<p>It's hard to get an email validator 100% correct. The only real way to get it correct would be to send a test email to the account. That said, there are a few basic checks that can help make sure that you're getting something reasonable.</p>

<p>Some things to improve:</p>

<p>Instead of new <code>RegExp</code>, just try writing the <code>regexp</code> out like this:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (reg.<span class="hljs-title function_">test</span>(<span class="hljs-regexp">/@/</span>))
</code></pre>

<p>Second, check to make sure that a period comes after the <code>@</code> sign, and make sure that there are characters between the <code>@</code>s and periods. </p>

<h2>A solution that does not check the existence of the TLD is incomplete.</h2>

<p>Almost all answers to this questions suggest using Regex to validate emails addresses. I think Regex is only good for a rudimentary validation. It seems that the checking validation of email addresses is actually two separate problems:</p>

<p><strong>1- Validation of email format:</strong> Making sure if the email complies with the format and pattern of emails in RFC 5322 and if the TLD actually exists. A list of all valid TLDs can be found <a href="http://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>For example, although the address <code>example@example.ccc</code> will pass the regex, it is not a valid email, because <code>ccc</code> is not a top-level domain by IANA.</p>

<p><strong>2- Making sure the email actually exists:</strong> For doing this, <strong>the only option</strong> is <a href="https://davidcel.is/posts/stop-validating-email-addresses-with-regex/#just-send-them-an-email-already" rel="noreferrer">to send the users an email</a>.</p>

<p>Use this code inside your validator function:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> emailID = <span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-property">forms</span>[<span class="hljs-string">"formName"</span>][<span class="hljs-string">"form element id"</span>].<span class="hljs-property">value</span>;
atpos = emailID.<span class="hljs-title function_">indexOf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"@"</span>);
dotpos = emailID.<span class="hljs-title function_">lastIndexOf</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"."</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (atpos &lt; <span class="hljs-number">1</span> || ( dotpos - atpos &lt; <span class="hljs-number">2</span> ))

<p>I was looking for a Regex in JS that passes all Email Address test cases:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>email@example.com</code> Valid email</p></li>
<li><p><code>firstname.lastname@example.com</code>  Email contains dot in the address field</p></li>
<li><p><code>email@subdomain.example.com</code> Email contains dot with subdomain</p></li>
<li><p><code>firstname+lastname@example.com</code>   Plus sign is considered valid character</p></li>
<li><p><code>email@192.0.2.123</code> Domain is valid IP address</p></li>
<li><p><code>email@[192.0.2.123]</code> Square bracket around IP address is considered valid</p></li>
<li><p><code>email@example.com</code> Quotes around email is considered valid</p></li>
<li><p><code>1234567890@example.com</code> Digits in address are valid</p></li>
<li><p><code>email@domain-one.example</code> Dash in domain name is valid</p></li>
<li><p><code>_______@example.com</code> Underscore in the address field is valid</p></li>
<li><p><code>email@example.name</code> <code>.name</code> is valid Top Level Domain name</p></li>
<li><p><code>email@example.co.jp</code> Dot in Top Level Domain name also considered valid (using <code>co.jp</code> as example here)</p></li>
<li><p><code>firstname-lastname@example.com</code> Dash in address field is valid</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here we go :</p>
