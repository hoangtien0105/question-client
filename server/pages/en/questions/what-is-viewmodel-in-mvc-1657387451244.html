It is something different than your domain model. It is a model for the view.\n\nLet us say that you have an Employee class that represents your employee domain model and it contains the following properties (unique identifier, first name, last name and date created):\n\npublic class Employee : IEntity\n{\n     public int Id { get; set; }\n\n     public string FirstName { get; set; }\n\n     public string LastName { get; set; }\n\n     public DateTime DateCreated { get; set; }\n}\n\n\nView models differ from domain models in that view models only contain the data (represented by properties) that you want to use on your view.  For example, lets say that you want to add a new employee record, your view model might look like this:\n\npublic class CreateEmployeeViewModel\n{\n     public string FirstName { get; set; }\n\n     public string LastName { get; set; }\n}\n\n\nAs you can see it only contains two of the properties. These two properties are also in the employee domain model.  Why is this you may ask?  Id might not be set from the view, it might be auto generated by the Employee table.  And DateCreated might also be set in the stored procedure or in the service layer of your application.  So Id and DateCreated are not needed in the view model. You might want to display these two properties when you view an employees details (an employee that has already been captured) as static text.\n\nWhen loading the view/page, the create action method in your employee controller will create an instance of this view model, populate any fields if required, and then pass this view model to the view/page:\n\npublic class EmployeeController : Controller\n{\n     private readonly IEmployeeService employeeService;\n\n     public EmployeeController(IEmployeeService employeeService)\n     {\n          this.employeeService = employeeService;\n     }\n\n     public ActionResult Create()\n     {\n          CreateEmployeeViewModel model = new CreateEmployeeViewModel();\n\n          return View(model);\n     }\n\n     public ActionResult Create(CreateEmployeeViewModel model)\n     {\n          // Do what ever needs to be done before adding the employee to the database\n     }\n}\n\n\nYour view/page might look like this (assuming you are using ASP.NET MVC and the Razor view engine):\n\n@model MyProject.Web.ViewModels.CreateEmployeeViewModel\n\n&lt;table&gt;\n     &lt;tr&gt;\n          &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;First Name:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n          &lt;td&gt;@Html.TextBoxFor(m =&gt; m.FirstName, new { maxlength = &quot;50&quot;, size = &quot;50&quot; })\n              @Html.ValidationMessageFor(m =&gt; m.FirstName)\n          &lt;/td&gt;\n     &lt;/tr&gt;\n     &lt;tr&gt;\n          &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Last Name:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n          &lt;td&gt;@Html.TextBoxFor(m =&gt; m.LastName, new { maxlength = &quot;50&quot;, size = &quot;50&quot; })\n              @Html.ValidationMessageFor(m =&gt; m.LastName)\n          &lt;/td&gt;\n     &lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\n\nValidation would thus be done only on FirstName and LastName.  Using FluentValidation you might have validation like this:\n\npublic class CreateEmployeeViewModelValidator : AbstractValidator&lt;CreateEmployeeViewModel&gt;\n{\n     public CreateEmployeeViewModelValidator()\n     {\n          RuleFor(m =&gt; m.FirstName)\n               .NotEmpty()\n               .WithMessage(&quot;First name required&quot;)\n               .Length(1, 50)\n               .WithMessage(&quot;First name must not be greater than 50 characters&quot;);\n\n          RuleFor(m =&gt; m.LastName)\n               .NotEmpty()\n               .WithMessage(&quot;Last name required&quot;)\n               .Length(1, 50)\n               .WithMessage(&quot;Last name must not be greater than 50 characters&quot;);\n     }\n}\n\n\nAnd with Data Annotations it might look this:\n\npublic class CreateEmployeeViewModel : ViewModelBase\n{\n    [Display(Name = &quot;First Name&quot;)]\n    [Required(ErrorMessage = &quot;First name required&quot;)]\n    public string FirstName { get; set; }\n\n    [Display(Name = &quot;Last Name&quot;)]\n    [Required(ErrorMessage = &quot;Last name required&quot;)]\n    public string LastName { get; set; }\n}\n\n\nThe key thing to remember is that the view model only represents the data that you want to use, nothing else.  You can imagine all the unnecessary code and validation if you have a domain model with 30 properties and you only want to update a single value.  Given this scenario you would only have this one value/property in the view model and not all the properties that are in the domain object.\n\nA view model might not only have data from one database table. It can combine data from another table. Take my example above about adding a new employee record. Besides adding just the first and last names you might also want to add the department of the employee. This list of departments will come from your Departments table. So now you have data from the Employees and Departments tables in one view model. You will just then need to add the following two properties to your view model and populate it with data:\n\npublic int DepartmentId { get; set; }\n\npublic IEnumerable&lt;Department&gt; Departments { get; set; }\n\n\nWhen editing employee data (an employee that has already been added to the database) it wouldnt differ much from my example above.  Create a view model, call it for example EditEmployeeViewModel. Only have the data that you want to edit in this view model, like first name and last name. Edit the data and click the submit button. I wouldnt worry too much about the Id field because the Id value will probably been in the URL, for example: \n\nhttp://www.yourwebsite.com/Employee/Edit/3\n\n\nTake this Id and pass it through to your repository layer, together with your first name and last name values.\n\nWhen deleting a record, I normally follow the same path as with the edit view model. I would also have a URL, for example:\n\nhttp://www.yourwebsite.com/Employee/Delete/3\n\n\nWhen the view loads up for the first time I would get the employees data from the database using the Id of 3. I would then just display static text on my view/page so that the user can see what employee is being deleted. When the user clicks the Delete button, I would just use the Id value of 3 and pass it to my repository layer. You only need the Id to delete a record from the table.\n\nAnother point, you dont really need a view model for every action. If it is simple data then it would be fine to only use EmployeeViewModel. If it is complex views/pages and they differ from each other then I would suggest you use separate view models for each.\n\nI hope this clears up any confusion that you had about view models and domain models.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"View model is a class that represents the data model used in a specific view. We could use this class as a model for a login page:\n\npublic class LoginPageVM\n{\n    [Required(ErrorMessage = &quot;Are you really trying to login without entering username?&quot;)]\n    [DisplayName(&quot;Username/e-mail&quot;)]\n    public string UserName { get; set; }\n    [Required(ErrorMessage = &quot;Please enter password:)&quot;)]\n    [DisplayName(&quot;Password&quot;)]\n    public string Password { get; set; }\n    [DisplayName(&quot;Stay logged in when browser is closed&quot;)]\n    public bool RememberMe { get; set; }\n}\n\n\nUsing this view model you can define the view (Razor view engine):\n\n@model CamelTrap.Models.ViewModels.LoginPageVM\n\n@using (Html.BeginForm()) {\n    @Html.EditorFor(m =&gt; m);\n    &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Save&quot; class=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;\n}\n\n\nAnd actions:\n\n[HttpGet]\npublic ActionResult LoginPage()\n{\n    return View();\n}\n\n[HttpPost]\npublic ActionResult LoginPage(LoginPageVM model)\n{\n    ...code to login user to application...\n    return View(model);\n}\n\n\nWhich produces this result (screen is taken after submitting form, with validation messages):\n\n\n\nAs you can see, a view model has many roles:\n\n\nView models documents a view by consisting only fields, that are represented in view.\nView models may contain specific validation rules using data annotations or IDataErrorInfo.\nView model defines how a view should look (for LabelFor,EditorFor,DisplayFor helpers).\nView models can combine values from different database entities.\nYou can specify easily display templates for view models and reuse them in many places using DisplayFor or EditorFor helpers.\n\n\nAnother example of a view model and its retrieval: We want to display basic user data, his privileges and users name. We create a special view model, which contains only the required fields. We retrieve data from different entities from database, but the view is only aware of the view model class:\n\npublic class UserVM {\n    public int ID { get; set; }\n    public string FirstName { get; set; }\n    public string LastName { get; set; }\n    public bool IsAdministrator { get; set; }\n    public string MothersName { get; set; }\n}\n\n\nRetrieval:\n\nvar user = db.userRepository.GetUser(id);\n\nvar model = new UserVM() {\n   ID = user.ID,\n   FirstName = user.FirstName,\n   LastName = user.LastName,\n   IsAdministrator = user.Proviledges.IsAdministrator,\n   MothersName = user.Mother.FirstName + &quot; &quot; + user.Mother.LastName\n} \n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Edit: I updated this answer on my Blog:\nhttp://www.samwheat.com/post/The-function-of-ViewModels-in-MVC-web-development\nMy answer is a bit lengthy but I think it is important to compare view models to other types of commonly used models to understand why they are different and why they are necessary.\nTo summarize, and to directly answer the question that is asked:\nGenerally speaking, a view model is an object that contains all the properties and methods necessary to render a view. View model properties are often related to data objects such as customers and orders and in addition, they also contain properties related to the page or application itself such as user name, application name, etc. View models provide a convenient object to pass to a rendering engine to create an HTML page.  One of many reasons to use a view model is that view models provide a way to unit test certain presentation tasks such as handling user input, validating data, retrieving data for display, etc.\nHere is a comparison of Entity models (a.ka. DTOs a.ka. models), Presentation Models, and View Models.\nData Transfer Objects a.k.a Model\nA Data Transfer Object (DTO) is a class with properties that match a table schema in a database.  DTOs are named for their common usage for shuttling data to and from a data store.\nCharacteristics of DTOs:\n\nAre business objects  their definition is dependent on application data.\nUsually contain properties only  no code.\nPrimarily used for transporting data to and from a database.\nProperties exactly or closely match fields on a specific table in a data store.\n\nDatabase tables are usually normalized therefore DTOs are usually normalized also.  This makes them of limited use for presenting data.  However, for certain simple data structures, they often do quite well.\nHere are two examples of what DTOs might look like:\npublic class Customer\n{\n    public int ID { get; set; }\n    public string CustomerName { get; set; }\n}\n\n\npublic class Order\n{\n    public int ID { get; set; }\n    public int CustomerID { get; set; }\n    public DateTime OrderDate { get; set; }\n    public Decimal OrderAmount { get; set; }\n}\n\n\nPresentation Models\nA presentation model is a utility class that is used to render data on a screen or report.  Presentation models are typically used to model complex data structures that are composed of data from multiple DTOs.  Presentation models often represent a denormalized view of data.\nCharacteristics of Presentation Models:\n\nAre business objects  their definition is dependent on application data.\nContain mostly properties. Code is typically limited to formatting data or converting it to or from a DTO.  Presentation Models should not contain business logic.\nOften present a denormalized view of data.  That is, they often combine properties from multiple DTOs.\nOften contain properties of a different base type than a DTO.  For example, dollar amounts may be represented as strings so they can contain commas and a currency symbol.\nOften defined by how they are used as well as their object characteristics.  In other words, a simple DTO that is used as the backing model for rendering a grid is in fact also a presentation model in the context of that grid.\n\nPresentation models are used as needed and where needed (whereas DTOs are usually tied to the database schema).  A presentation model may be used to model data for an entire page, a grid on a page, or a dropdown on a grid on a page. Presentation models often contain properties that are other presentation models.  Presentation models are often constructed for a single-use purpose such as to render a specific grid on a single page.\nAn example presentation model:\npublic class PresentationOrder\n{\n    public int OrderID { get; set; }\n    public DateTime OrderDate { get; set; }\n    public string PrettyDate { get { return OrderDate.ToShortDateString(); } }\n    public string CustomerName { get; set; }\n    public Decimal OrderAmount { get; set; }\n    public string PrettyAmount { get { return string.Format(&quot;{0:C}&quot;, OrderAmount); } }\n}\n\nView Models\nA view model is similar to a presentation model in that is a backing class for rendering a view.  However, it is very different from a Presentation Model or a DTO in how it is constructed.  View models often contain the same properties as presentation models and DTOs and for this reason, they are often confused one for the other.\nCharacteristics of View Models:\n\nAre the single source of data used to render a page or screen.  Usually, this means that a view model will expose every property that any control on the page will need to render itself correctly.  Making the view model the single source of data for the view greatly improves its capability and value for unit testing.\nAre composite objects that contain properties that consist of application data as well as properties that are used by application code.  This characteristic is crucial when designing the view model for reusability and is discussed in the examples below.\nContain application code.  View Models usually contain methods that are called during rendering and when the user is interacting with the page.  This code typically relates to event handling, animation, visibility of controls, styling, etc.\nContain code that calls business services for the purpose of retrieving data or sending it to a database server.  This code is often mistakenly placed in a controller. Calling business services from a controller usually limits the usefulness of the view model for unit testing.  To be clear, view models themselves should not contain business logic but should make calls to services which do contain business logic.\nOften contain properties that are other view models for other pages or screens.\nAre written per page or per screen.  A unique View Model is typically written for every page or screen in an application.\nUsually derive from a base class since most pages and screens share common properties.\n\nView Model Composition\nAs stated earlier, view models are composite objects in that they combine application properties and business data properties on a single object.  Examples of commonly used application properties that are used on view models are:\n\nProperties that are used to display application state such as error messages, user name, status, etc.\nProperties used to format, display, stylize, or animate controls.\nProperties used for data binding such as list objects and properties that hold intermediate data that is input by the user.\n\nThe following examples show why the composite nature of view models is important and how we can best construct a View Model that efficient and reusable.\nAssume we are writing a web application.  One of the requirements of the application design is that the page title, user name, and application name must be displayed on every page.  If we want to create a page to display a presentation order object, we may modify the presentation model as follows:\npublic class PresentationOrder\n{\n    public string PageTitle { get; set; }\n    public string UserName { get; set; }\n    public string ApplicationName { get; set; }\n    public int OrderID { get; set; }\n    public DateTime OrderDate { get; set; }\n    public string PrettyDate { get { return OrderDate.ToShortDateString(); } }\n    public string CustomerName { get; set; }\n    public Decimal OrderAmount { get; set; }\n    public string PrettyAmount { get { return string.Format(&quot;{0:C}&quot;, OrderAmount); } }\n}\n\nThis design might work but what if we want to create a page that will display a list of orders?  The PageTitle, UserName, and ApplicationName properties will be repeated and become unwieldy to work with.  Also, what if we want to define some page-level logic in the constructor of the class?  We can no longer do that if we create an instance for every order that will be displayed.\nComposition over inheritance\nHere is a way we might re-factor the order presentation model such that it becomes a true view model and will be useful for displaying a single PresentationOrder object or a collection of PresentationOrder objects:\npublic class PresentationOrderVM\n{\n    // Application properties\n    public string PageTitle { get; set; }\n    public string UserName { get; set; }\n    public string ApplicationName { get; set; }\n\n    // Business properties\n    public PresentationOrder Order { get; set; }\n}\n\n\npublic class PresentationOrderVM\n{\n    // Application properties\n    public string PageTitle { get; set; }\n    public string UserName { get; set; }\n    public string ApplicationName { get; set; }\n\n    // Business properties\n    public List&lt;PresentationOrder&gt; Orders { get; set; }\n}\n\nLooking at the above two classes we can see that one way to think about a view model is that it is a presentation model that contains another presentation model as a property.  The top-level presentation model (i.e. view model) contains properties that are relevant to the page or application while the presentation model (property) contains properties that are relevant to application data.\nWe can take our design a step further and create a base view model class that can be used not only for PresentationOrders but for any other class as well:\npublic class BaseViewModel\n{\n    // Application properties\n    public string PageTitle { get; set; }\n    public string UserName { get; set; }\n    public string ApplicationName { get; set; }\n}\n\nNow we can simplify our PresentationOrderVM like this:\npublic class PresentationOrderVM : BaseViewModel\n{\n    // Business properties\n    public PresentationOrder Order { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class PresentationOrderVM : BaseViewModel\n{\n    // Business properties\n    public List&lt;PresentationOrder&gt; Orders { get; set; }\n}\n\nWe can make our BaseViewModel even more re-usable by making it generic:\npublic class BaseViewModel&lt;T&gt;\n{\n    // Application properties\n    public string PageTitle { get; set; }\n    public string UserName { get; set; }\n    public string ApplicationName { get; set; }\n\n    // Business property\n    public T BusinessObject { get; set; }\n}\n\nNow our implementations are effortless:\npublic class PresentationOrderVM : BaseViewModel&lt;PresentationOrder&gt;\n{\n    // done!\n}\n\npublic class PresentationOrderVM : BaseViewModel&lt;List&lt;PresentationOrder&gt;&gt;\n{\n    // done!\n}\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"If you have properties specific to the view, and not related to the DB/Service/Data store, it is a good practice to use ViewModels.

<p>A <code>view model</code> represents the data that you want to display on your view/page, whether it be used for static text or for input values (like textboxes and dropdown lists) that can be added to the database (or edited). It is something different than your <code>domain model</code>. It is a model for the view.</p>

<p>Let us say that you have an <code>Employee</code> class that represents your employee domain model and it contains the following properties (unique identifier, first name, last name and date created):</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Employee</span> : <span class="hljs-title">IEntity</span>
{
     <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> Id { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }

     <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> FirstName { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }

     <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> LastName { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }

     <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> DateTime DateCreated { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>View models differ from domain models in that view models only contain the data (represented by properties) that you want to use on your view.  For example, lets say that you want to add a new employee record, your view model might look like this:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">CreateEmployeeViewModel</span>
{
     <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> FirstName { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }

     <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> LastName { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see it only contains two of the properties. These two properties are also in the employee domain model.  Why is this you may ask?  <code>Id</code> might not be set from the view, it might be auto generated by the Employee table.  And <code>DateCreated</code> might also be set in the stored procedure or in the service layer of your application.  So <code>Id</code> and <code>DateCreated</code> are not needed in the view model. You might want to display these two properties when you view an employees details (an employee that has already been captured) as static text.</p>

<p>When loading the view/page, the create action method in your employee controller will create an instance of this view model, populate any fields if required, and then pass this view model to the view/page:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">EmployeeController</span> : <span class="hljs-title">Controller</span>
{
     <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">readonly</span> IEmployeeService employeeService;

     <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-title">EmployeeController</span>(<span class="hljs-params">IEmployeeService employeeService</span>)</span>
     {
          <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.employeeService = employeeService;
     }

     <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> ActionResult <span class="hljs-title">Create</span>()</span>
     {
          CreateEmployeeViewModel model = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> CreateEmployeeViewModel();

          <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> View(model);
     }

     <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> ActionResult <span class="hljs-title">Create</span>(<span class="hljs-params">CreateEmployeeViewModel model</span>)</span>
     {
          <span class="hljs-comment">// Do what ever needs to be done before adding the employee to the database</span>
     }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your view/page might look like this (assuming you are using <code>ASP.NET MVC</code> and the <code>Razor</code> view engine):</p>

          <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">td</span>&gt;</span>@Html.TextBoxFor(m =&gt; m.LastName, new { maxlength = "50", size = "50" })
              @Html.ValidationMessageFor(m =&gt; m.LastName)
          <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">td</span>&gt;</span>
     <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">tr</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">table</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Validation would thus be done only on <code>FirstName</code> and <code>LastName</code>.  Using <a href="https://fluentvalidation.net/" rel="noreferrer">FluentValidation</a> you might have validation like this:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-scss">public class CreateEmployeeViewModelValidator : AbstractValidator&lt;CreateEmployeeViewModel&gt;
{
     public <span class="hljs-built_in">CreateEmployeeViewModelValidator</span>()
     {
          <span class="hljs-built_in">RuleFor</span>(m =&gt; m.FirstName)
               <span class="hljs-selector-class">.NotEmpty</span>()
               <span class="hljs-selector-class">.WithMessage</span>("First name required")
               <span class="hljs-selector-class">.Length</span>(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">50</span>)
               <span class="hljs-selector-class">.WithMessage</span>("First name must not be greater than <span class="hljs-number">50</span> characters");

          <span class="hljs-built_in">RuleFor</span>(m =&gt; m.LastName)
               <span class="hljs-selector-class">.NotEmpty</span>()
               <span class="hljs-selector-class">.WithMessage</span>("Last name required")
               <span class="hljs-selector-class">.Length</span>(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">50</span>)
               <span class="hljs-selector-class">.WithMessage</span>("Last name must not be greater than <span class="hljs-number">50</span> characters");
     }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And with Data Annotations it might look this:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">CreateEmployeeViewModel</span> : <span class="hljs-title">ViewModelBase</span>
{
    [<span class="hljs-meta">Display(Name = <span class="hljs-string">"First Name"</span>)</span>]
    [<span class="hljs-meta">Required(ErrorMessage = <span class="hljs-string">"First name required"</span>)</span>]
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> FirstName { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }

    [<span class="hljs-meta">Display(Name = <span class="hljs-string">"Last Name"</span>)</span>]
    [<span class="hljs-meta">Required(ErrorMessage = <span class="hljs-string">"Last name required"</span>)</span>]
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> LastName { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The key thing to remember is that the view model only represents the data that you want to use</strong>, nothing else.  You can imagine all the unnecessary code and validation if you have a domain model with 30 properties and you only want to update a single value.  Given this scenario you would only have this one value/property in the view model and not all the properties that are in the domain object.</p>

<p>A view model might not only have data from one database table. It can combine data from another table. Take my example above about adding a new employee record. Besides adding just the first and last names you might also want to add the department of the employee. This list of departments will come from your <code>Departments</code> table. So now you have data from the <code>Employees</code> and <code>Departments</code> tables in one view model. You will just then need to add the following two properties to your view model and populate it with data:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> DepartmentId { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }

<span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> IEnumerable&lt;Department&gt; Departments { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
</code></pre>

<p>When editing employee data (an employee that has already been added to the database) it wouldnt differ much from my example above.  Create a view model, call it for example <code>EditEmployeeViewModel</code>. Only have the data that you want to edit in this view model, like first name and last name. Edit the data and click the submit button. I wouldnt worry too much about the <code>Id</code> field because the <code>Id</code> value will probably been in the URL, for example: </p>

<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>http://www.yourwebsite.com/Employee/Edit/3
</code></pre>

<p>Take this <code>Id</code> and pass it through to your repository layer, together with your first name and last name values.</p>

<p>When deleting a record, I normally follow the same path as with the edit view model. I would also have a URL, for example:</p>

<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>http://www.yourwebsite.com/Employee/Delete/3
</code></pre>

<p>When the view loads up for the first time I would get the employees data from the database using the <code>Id</code> of 3. I would then just display static text on my view/page so that the user can see what employee is being deleted. When the user clicks the Delete button, I would just use the <code>Id</code> value of 3 and pass it to my repository layer. You only need the <code>Id</code> to delete a record from the table.</p>

<p>Another point, you dont really need a view model for every action. If it is simple data then it would be fine to only use <code>EmployeeViewModel</code>. If it is complex views/pages and they differ from each other then I would suggest you use separate view models for each.</p>

<p>I hope this clears up any confusion that you had about view models and domain models.</p>

<p><strong>View model</strong> is a class that represents the data model used in a specific view. We could use this class as a model for a login page:</p>

<p>Using this view model you can define the view (Razor view engine):</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">@model CamelTrap.Models.ViewModels.LoginPageVM</span>

<p>And actions:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-scss"><span class="hljs-selector-attr">[HttpGet]</span>
public ActionResult <span class="hljs-built_in">LoginPage</span>()

    ..<span class="hljs-selector-class">.code</span> to login user to application...
    return <span class="hljs-built_in">View</span>(model);

<p>Which produces this result (screen is taken after submitting form, with validation messages):</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xfiZ2.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>As you can see, a view model has many roles:</p>

<ul>
<li>View models documents a view by consisting only fields, that are represented in view.</li>
<li>View models may contain specific validation rules using data annotations or IDataErrorInfo.</li>
<li>View model defines how a view should look (for <code>LabelFor</code>,<code>EditorFor</code>,<code>DisplayFor</code> helpers).</li>
<li>View models can combine values from different database entities.</li>
<li>You can specify easily display templates for view models and reuse them in many places using DisplayFor or EditorFor helpers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another example of a view model and its retrieval: We want to display basic user data, his privileges and users name. We create a special view model, which contains only the required fields. We retrieve data from different entities from database, but the view is only aware of the view model class:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">UserVM</span> {

<p><strong>Edit: I updated this answer on my Blog:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.samwheat.com/post/The-function-of-ViewModels-in-MVC-web-development" rel="noreferrer">http://www.samwheat.com/post/The-function-of-ViewModels-in-MVC-web-development</a></p>
<p>My answer is a bit lengthy but I think it is important to compare view models to other types of commonly used models to understand why they are different and why they are necessary.</p>
<p>To summarize, and to directly answer the question that is asked:</p>
<p>Generally speaking, a view model is an object that contains all the properties and methods necessary to render a view. View model properties are often related to data objects such as customers and orders and in addition, they also contain properties related to the page or application itself such as user name, application name, etc. View models provide a convenient object to pass to a rendering engine to create an HTML page.  One of many reasons to use a view model is that view models provide a way to unit test certain presentation tasks such as handling user input, validating data, retrieving data for display, etc.</p>
<p>Here is a comparison of Entity models (a.ka. DTOs a.ka. models), Presentation Models, and View Models.</p>
<p><strong>Data Transfer Objects a.k.a Model</strong></p>
<p>A Data Transfer Object (DTO) is a class with properties that match a table schema in a database.  DTOs are named for their common usage for shuttling data to and from a data store.<br>
Characteristics of DTOs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are business objects  their definition is dependent on application data.</li>
<li>Usually contain properties only  no code.</li>
<li>Primarily used for transporting data to and from a database.</li>
<li>Properties exactly or closely match fields on a specific table in a data store.</li>
</ul>
<p>Database tables are usually normalized therefore DTOs are usually normalized also.  This makes them of limited use for presenting data.  However, for certain simple data structures, they often do quite well.</p>
<p>Here are two examples of what DTOs might look like:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Customer</span>
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> ID { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> CustomerName { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
}


<span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Order</span>
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> ID { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> CustomerID { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> DateTime OrderDate { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> Decimal OrderAmount { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
}
</code></pre>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Presentation Models</strong></p>
<p>A presentation model is a <em>utility</em> class that is used to render data on a screen or report.  Presentation models are typically used to model complex data structures that are composed of data from multiple DTOs.  Presentation models often represent a denormalized view of data.</p>
<p>Characteristics of Presentation Models:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are business objects  their definition is dependent on application data.</li>
<li>Contain mostly properties. Code is typically limited to formatting data or converting it to or from a DTO.  Presentation Models should not contain business logic.</li>
<li>Often present a denormalized view of data.  That is, they often combine properties from multiple DTOs.</li>
<li>Often contain properties of a different base type than a DTO.  For example, dollar amounts may be represented as strings so they can contain commas and a currency symbol.</li>
<li>Often defined by how they are used as well as their object characteristics.  In other words, a simple DTO that is used as the backing model for rendering a grid is in fact also a presentation model in the context of that grid.</li>
</ul>
<p>Presentation models are used as needed and where needed (whereas DTOs are usually tied to the database schema).  A presentation model may be used to model data for an entire page, a grid on a page, or a dropdown on a grid on a page. Presentation models often contain properties that are other presentation models.  Presentation models are often constructed for a single-use purpose such as to render a specific grid on a single page.</p>
<p>An example presentation model:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">PresentationOrder</span>
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> OrderID { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> DateTime OrderDate { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> PrettyDate { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span> { <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> OrderDate.ToShortDateString(); } }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> CustomerName { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> Decimal OrderAmount { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> PrettyAmount { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span> { <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span>.Format(<span class="hljs-string">"{0:C}"</span>, OrderAmount); } }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>View Models</strong></p>
<p>A view model is similar to a presentation model in that is a backing class for rendering a view.  However, it is very different from a Presentation Model or a DTO in how it is constructed.  View models often contain the same properties as presentation models and DTOs and for this reason, they are often confused one for the other.</p>
<p>Characteristics of View Models:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the single source of data used to render a page or screen.  Usually, this means that a view model will expose every property that any control on the page will need to render itself correctly.  Making the view model the single source of data for the view greatly improves its capability and value for unit testing.</li>
<li>Are <strong>composite objects</strong> that contain properties that consist of application data as well as properties that are used by application code.  This characteristic is crucial when designing the view model for reusability and is discussed in the examples below.</li>
<li>Contain application code.  View Models usually contain methods that are called during rendering and when the user is interacting with the page.  This code typically relates to event handling, animation, visibility of controls, styling, etc.</li>
<li>Contain code that calls business services for the purpose of retrieving data or sending it to a database server.  This code is often mistakenly placed in a controller. Calling business services from a controller usually limits the usefulness of the view model for unit testing.  To be clear, view models themselves should not contain business logic but should make calls to services which do contain business logic.</li>
<li>Often contain properties that are other view models for other pages or screens.</li>
<li>Are written per page or per screen.  A unique View Model is typically written for every page or screen in an application.</li>
<li>Usually derive from a base class since most pages and screens share common properties.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>View Model Composition</em></p>
<p>As stated earlier, view models are composite objects in that they combine application properties and business data properties on a single object.  Examples of commonly used application properties that are used on view models are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Properties that are used to display application state such as error messages, user name, status, etc.</li>
<li>Properties used to format, display, stylize, or animate controls.</li>
<li>Properties used for data binding such as list objects and properties that hold intermediate data that is input by the user.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following examples show why the composite nature of view models is important and how we can best construct a View Model that efficient and reusable.</p>
<p>Assume we are writing a web application.  One of the requirements of the application design is that the page title, user name, and application name must be displayed on every page.  If we want to create a page to display a presentation order object, we may modify the presentation model as follows:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">PresentationOrder</span>
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> PageTitle { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> UserName { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> ApplicationName { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> OrderID { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> DateTime OrderDate { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> PrettyDate { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span> { <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> OrderDate.ToShortDateString(); } }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> CustomerName { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> Decimal OrderAmount { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> PrettyAmount { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span> { <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span>.Format(<span class="hljs-string">"{0:C}"</span>, OrderAmount); } }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This design might work but what if we want to create a page that will display a list of orders?  The PageTitle, UserName, and ApplicationName properties will be repeated and become unwieldy to work with.  Also, what if we want to define some page-level logic in the constructor of the class?  We can no longer do that if we create an instance for every order that will be displayed.</p>
<p><em>Composition over inheritance</em></p>
<p>Here is a way we might re-factor the order presentation model such that it becomes a true view model and will be useful for displaying a single PresentationOrder object or a collection of PresentationOrder objects:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">PresentationOrderVM</span>
{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Application properties</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> PageTitle { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> UserName { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> ApplicationName { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }

    <span class="hljs-comment">// Business properties</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> PresentationOrder Order { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
}

<p>Looking at the above two classes we can see that one way to think about a view model is that it is a presentation model that contains another presentation model as a property.  The top-level presentation model (i.e. view model) contains properties that are relevant to the page or application while the presentation model (property) contains properties that are relevant to application data.</p>
<p>We can take our design a step further and create a base view model class that can be used not only for PresentationOrders but for any other class as well:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">BaseViewModel</span>
{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Application properties</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> PageTitle { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> UserName { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> ApplicationName { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can simplify our PresentationOrderVM like this:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-kotlin"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">PresentationOrderVM</span> : <span class="hljs-type">BaseViewModel</span></span>
{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Business properties</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> PresentationOrder Order { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">PresentationOrderVM</span> : <span class="hljs-type">BaseViewModel</span></span>
{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Business properties</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> List&lt;PresentationOrder&gt; Orders { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can make our BaseViewModel even more re-usable by making it generic:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">BaseViewModel</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-title">T</span>&gt;
{
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Application properties</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> PageTitle { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> UserName { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> ApplicationName { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }

    <span class="hljs-comment">// Business property</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> T BusinessObject { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now our implementations are effortless:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-kotlin"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">PresentationOrderVM</span> : <span class="hljs-type">BaseViewModel</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-type">PresentationOrder</span>&gt;</span>

<p>If you have properties specific to the view, and not related to the DB/Service/Data store, it is a good practice to use ViewModels. Say, you want to leave a checkbox selected based on a DB field (or two) but the DB field itself isn't a boolean. While it is possible to create these properties in the Model itself and keep it hidden from the binding to data, you may not want to clutter the Model depending on the amount of such fields and transactions.</p>

<p>If a Model is akin to a database <em><strong>Table</strong></em>, then a ViewModel is akin to a database <em><strong>View</strong></em> - A view typically either returns small amounts of data from one table or, complex sets of data from multiple tables (joins).</p>
<p>I find myself using ViewModels to pass the info into a view/form, and then transferring that data into a valid Model when the form posts back to the controller - also very handy for storing Lists(IEnumerable).</p>

<p>View model a is simple class which can contain more than one class property. We use it to inherit all the required properties, e.g. I have two classes Student and Subject </p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp">Public <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Student</span>
{
<span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> Id {<span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>;}
<span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> Name {<span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>;}
}  
Public <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Subject</span>
{
<span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span> SubjectID {<span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>;}
<span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> SubjectName {<span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>;}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we want to display records student's Name and Subject's Name in View (In MVC), but it's not possible to add more than one classes like:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-less"> <span class="hljs-variable">@model</span> ProjectName.Model.Student  
 <span class="hljs-variable">@model</span> ProjectName.Model.Subject
</code></pre>

<p>the code above will throw an error...</p>

<p>Now we create one class and can give it any name, but this format "XyzViewModel" will make it easier to understand. It is inheritance concept.
Now we create a third class with the following name:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">StudentViewModel</span>:<span class="hljs-title">Subject</span>
{

<span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> Name {<span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>;}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now  we use this ViewModel in View </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>@model ProjectName.Model.StudentViewModel</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now we are able to access all the properties of StudentViewModel and inherited class in View.</p>

<p>A lot of big examples, let me explain in a clear and crispy way.</p>
<p>ViewModel = Model that is created to serve the view.</p>
<p><em>ASP.NET MVC view can't have more than one model so if we need to display properties from more than one model in the view, it is not possible. ViewModel serves this purpose.</em></p>
<p>View Model is a model class that can hold only those properties that are required for a view. It can also contain properties from more than one entity (tables) of the database. As the name suggests, this model is created specifically for the View requirements.</p>
<p>A few examples of View Models are below</p>
<ul>
<li>To list data from more than entities in a view page  we can create a
View model and have properties of all the entities for which we want
to list data. Join those database entities and set the View model
properties and return to the View to show data of different
entities in one tabular form</li>
<li>The view model may define only specific fields of a single entity that is
required for the View.</li>
</ul>
<p>ViewModel can also be used to insert, and update records into more than one entity however the main use of ViewModel is to display columns from multiple entities (model) into a single view.</p>
<p>The way of creating a ViewModel is the same as creating a Model, the way of creating a view for the ViewModel is the same as creating a view for a Model.</p>
<p>Here is a small example of <a href="http://techfunda.com/howto/262/list-data-using-viewmodel" rel="nofollow noreferrer">List data using ViewModel</a>.</p>
<p>Hope this will be useful.</p>

<p>MVC doesn't have a view model: it has a model, view, and controller. A ViewModel is part of MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel). MVVM is derived from the Presentation Model and is popularized in WPF. There should also be a model in MVVM, but most people miss the point of that pattern completely and they will only have a view and a view model. The model in MVC is similar to the model in MVVM.</p>
<p>In MVC the process is split into 3 different responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>View is responsible for presenting the data to the user</li>
<li>A controller is responsible for the page flow</li>
<li>A model is responsible for the business logic</li>
</ul>
<p>MVC is not very suitable for web applications. It is a pattern introduced by Smalltalk for creating desktop applications. A web environment behaves completely differently. It doesn't make much sense to copy a 40-year-old concept from desktop development and paste it into a web environment. However, a lot of people think this is ok because their application compiles and returns the correct values. That is, in my opinion, not enough to declare a certain design choice as ok.</p>
<p>An example of a model in a web application could be:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">LoginModel</span>
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">readonly</span> AuthenticationService authentication;

    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-title">LoginModel</span>(<span class="hljs-params">AuthenticationService authentication</span>)</span>
    {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.authentication = authentication;
    }

    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">bool</span> <span class="hljs-title">Login</span>()</span>
    {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> authentication.Login(Username, Password);
    }

    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> Username { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span> Password { <span class="hljs-keyword">get</span>; <span class="hljs-keyword">set</span>; }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The controller can use it like this:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">LoginController</span>
{
    [<span class="hljs-meta">HttpPost</span>]
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> ActionResult <span class="hljs-title">Login</span>(<span class="hljs-params">LoginModel model</span>)</span>
    {
        <span class="hljs-built_in">bool</span> success = model.Login();

        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (success)
        {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> RedirectResult(<span class="hljs-string">"/dashboard"</span>);
        }
        <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>
        {
            TempData[<span class="hljs-string">"message"</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">"Invalid username and/or password"</span>;
            <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> RedirectResult(<span class="hljs-string">"/login"</span>);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Your controller methods and your models will be small, easily testable, and to the point.</p>

<p>ViewModel is the model containing fields to use in MVC View. Using ViewModel for the view has the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>As the database model (Entity class) contains a single table's data. If required data from multiple tables, a single ViewModel can have multiple tables' fields.</li>
<li>User can not interact directly with the database model, so the Database layer or model is secured.</li>
<li>It is used to get data from the database model through the repository and pass it to view. Similarly, it utilizes for posting data to the database model to update database records.</li>

<p>If you want to study code on how to set up a "Baseline" web application with ViewModels I can advise you to download this code on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/ajsaulsberry/BlipAjax" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://github.com/ajsaulsberry/BlipAjax</a>. I developed large enterprise applications. When you do this it's problematic to set up a good architecture that handles all this "ViewModel" functionality. I think with BlipAjax you will have a very good "baseline" to start with. It's just a simple website, but great in its simplicity. I like the way they used the English language to point out what's really needed in the application.</p>

You can imagine all the unnecessary code and validation if you have a domain model with 30 properties and you only want to update a single value.  Given this scenario you would only have this one value/property in the view model and not all the properties that are in the domain object.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A view model might not only have data from one database table. It can combine data from another table. Take my example above about adding a new employee record. Besides adding just the first and last names you might also want to add the department of the employee. This list of departments will come from your \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Departments\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; table. So now you have data from the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Employees\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Departments\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; tables in one view model. You will just then need to add the following two properties to your view model and populate it with data:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;default s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-csharp\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;public\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;int\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; DepartmentId { \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;get\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;set\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;; }\n\n\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;public\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; IEnumerable\u0026amp;lt;Department\u0026amp;gt; Departments { \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;get\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;set\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;; }\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When editing employee data (an employee that has already been added to the database) it wouldnt differ much from my example above.  Create a view model, call it for example \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;EditEmployeeViewModel\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. Only have the data that you want to edit in this view model, like first name and last name. Edit the data and click the submit button. I wouldnt worry too much about the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Id\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; field because the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Id\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; value will probably been in the URL, for example: \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-none s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;http://www.yourwebsite.com/Employee/Edit/3\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Take this \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Id\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and pass it through to your repository layer, together with your first name and last name values.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When deleting a record, I normally follow the same path as with the edit view model. I would also have a URL, for example:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-none s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;http://www.yourwebsite.com/Employee/Delete/3\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When the view loads up for the first time I would get the employees data from the database using the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Id\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; of 3. I would then just display static text on my view/page so that the user can see what employee is being deleted. When the user clicks the Delete button, I would just use the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Id\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; value of 3 and pass it to my repository layer.

View model properties are often related to data objects such as customers and orders and in addition, they also contain properties related to the page or application itself such as user name, application name, etc. View models provide a convenient object to pass to a rendering engine to create an HTML page.  One of many reasons to use a view model is that view models provide a way to unit test certain presentation tasks such as handling user input, validating data, retrieving data for display, etc.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Here is a comparison of Entity models (a.ka.

Presentation models are typically used to model complex data structures that are composed of data from multiple DTOs.

Code is typically limited to formatting data or converting it to or from a DTO.  Presentation Models should not contain business logic.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Often present a denormalized view of data.  That is, they often combine properties from multiple DTOs.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Often contain properties of a different base type than a DTO.  For example, dollar amounts may be represented as strings so they can contain commas and a currency symbol.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Often defined by how they are used as well as their object characteristics.  In other words, a simple DTO that is used as the backing model for rendering a grid is in fact also a presentation model in the context of that grid.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Presentation models are used as needed and where needed (whereas DTOs are usually tied to the database schema).  A presentation model may be used to model data for an entire page, a grid on a page, or a dropdown on a grid on a page. Presentation models often contain properties that are other presentation models.  Presentation models are often constructed for a single-use purpose such as to render a specific grid on a single page.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;An example presentation model:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;default s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-csharp\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;public\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;class\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title\u0026quot;\u0026gt;PresentationOrder\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n{\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;public\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;int\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; OrderID { \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;get\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;set\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;; }\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;public\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; DateTime OrderDate { \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;get\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;set\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;; }\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;public\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;string\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; PrettyDate { \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;get\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; { \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;return\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; OrderDate.ToShortDateString(); } }\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;public\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;string\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; CustomerName { \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;get\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;set\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;; }\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;public\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; Decimal OrderAmount { \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;get\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;set\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;; }\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;public\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;string\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; PrettyAmount { \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;get\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; { \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;return\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;string\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;.Format(\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-string\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026quot;{0:C}\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;, OrderAmount); } }\n}\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;View Models\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A view model is similar to a presentation model in that is a backing class for rendering a view.  However, it is very different from a Presentation Model or a DTO in how it is constructed.  View models often contain the same properties as presentation models and DTOs and for this reason, they are often confused one for the other.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Characteristics of View Models:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Are the single source of data used to render a page or screen.  Usually, this means that a view model will expose every property that any control on the page will need to render itself correctly.  Making the view model the single source of data for the view greatly improves its capability and value for unit testing.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Are \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;composite objects\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; that contain properties that consist of application data as well as properties that are used by application code.  This characteristic is crucial when designing the view model for reusability and is discussed in the examples below.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Contain application code.  View Models usually contain methods that are called during rendering and when the user is interacting with the page.  This code typically relates to event handling, animation, visibility of controls, styling, etc.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Contain code that calls business services for the purpose of retrieving data or sending it to a database server.  This code is often mistakenly placed in a controller. Calling business services from a controller usually limits the usefulness of the view model for unit testing.  To be clear, view models themselves should not contain business logic but should make calls to services which do contain business logic.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Often contain properties that are other view models for other pages or screens.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Are written per page or per screen.  A unique View Model is typically written for every page or screen in an application.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Usually derive from a base class since most pages and screens share common properties.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;View Model Composition\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;As stated earlier, view models are composite objects in that they combine application properties and business data properties on a single object.

There should also be a model in MVVM, but most people miss the point of that pattern completely and they will only have a view and a view model. The model in MVC is similar to the model in MVVM.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In MVC the process is split into 3 different responsibilities:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;View is responsible for presenting the data to the user\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;A controller is responsible for the page flow\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;A model is responsible for the business logic\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;MVC is not very suitable for web applications.
