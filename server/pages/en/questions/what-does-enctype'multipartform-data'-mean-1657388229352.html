JSON is a common format for use with web services and some still use SOAP.)\nThe specifics of the formats don&apos;t matter to most developers. The important points are:\n\nNever use text/plain.\n\nWhen you are writing client-side code:\n\nuse multipart/form-data when your form includes any &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt; elements\notherwise you can use multipart/form-data or application/x-www-form-urlencoded but application/x-www-form-urlencoded will be more efficient\n\nWhen you are writing server-side code:\n\nUse a prewritten form handling library\n\nMost (such as Perl&apos;s CGI-&gt;param or the one exposed by PHP&apos;s $_POST superglobal) will take care of the differences for you. Don&apos;t bother trying to parse the raw input received by the server.\nSometimes you will find a library that can&apos;t handle both formats.  Node.js&apos;s most popular library for handling form data is body-parser which cannot handle multipart requests (but has documentation that recommends some alternatives which can).\n\nIf you are writing (or debugging) a library for parsing or generating the raw data, then you need to start worrying about the format. You might also want to know about it for interest&apos;s sake.\napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded is more or less the same as a query string on the end of the URL.\nmultipart/form-data is significantly more complicated but it allows entire files to be included in the data. An example of the result can be found in the HTML 4 specification.\ntext/plain is introduced by HTML 5 and is useful only for debugging  from the spec: They are not reliably interpretable by computer  and I&apos;d argue that the others combined with tools (like the Network Panel in the developer tools of most browsers) are better for that).\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"\nwhen should we use it?\n\nQuentin&apos;s answer is right: use multipart/form-data if the form contains a file upload, and application/x-www-form-urlencoded otherwise, which is the default if you omit enctype.\nI&apos;m going to:\n\nadd some more HTML5 references\nexplain why he is right with a form submit example\n\nHTML5 references\nThere are three possibilities for enctype:\n\napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded\nmultipart/form-data (spec points to RFC7578)\ntext/plain. This is &quot;not reliably interpretable by computer&quot;, so it should never be used in production, and we will not look further into it.\n\nHow to generate the examples\nOnce you see an example of each method, it becomes obvious how they work, and when you should use each one.\nYou can produce examples using:\n\nnc -l or an ECHO server: HTTP test server accepting GET/POST requests\na user agent like a browser or cURL\n\nSave the form to a minimal .html file:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;/&gt;\n  &lt;title&gt;upload&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;form action=&quot;http://localhost:8000&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;text1&quot; value=&quot;text default&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;text2&quot; value=&quot;a&amp;#x03C9;b&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; name=&quot;file1&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; name=&quot;file2&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; name=&quot;file3&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nWe set the default text value to a&amp;#x03C9;b, which means aωb because ω is U+03C9, which are the bytes 61 CF 89 62 in UTF-8.\nCreate files to upload:\necho &apos;Content of a.txt.&apos; &gt; a.txt\n\necho &apos;&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;title&gt;Content of a.html.&lt;/title&gt;&apos; &gt; a.html\n\n# Binary file containing 4 bytes: &apos;a&apos;, 1, 2 and &apos;b&apos;.\nprintf &apos;a\\xCF\\x89b&apos; &gt; binary\n\nRun our little echo server:\nwhile true; do printf &apos;&apos; | nc -l localhost 8000; done\n\nOpen the HTML on your browser, select the files and click on submit and check the terminal.\nnc prints the request received.\nTested on: Ubuntu 14.04.3, nc BSD 1.105, Firefox 40.\nmultipart/form-data\nFirefox sent:\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\n[[ Less interesting headers ... ]]\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------735323031399963166993862150\nContent-Length: 834\n\n-----------------------------735323031399963166993862150\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;text1&quot;\n\ntext default\n-----------------------------735323031399963166993862150\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;text2&quot;\n\naωb\n-----------------------------735323031399963166993862150\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;file1&quot;; filename=&quot;a.txt&quot;\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\nContent of a.txt.\n\n-----------------------------735323031399963166993862150\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;file2&quot;; filename=&quot;a.html&quot;\nContent-Type: text/html\n\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;title&gt;Content of a.html.&lt;/title&gt;\n\n-----------------------------735323031399963166993862150\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=&quot;file3&quot;; filename=&quot;binary&quot;\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\n\naωb\n-----------------------------735323031399963166993862150--\n\nFor the binary file and text field, the bytes 61 CF 89 62 (aωb in UTF-8) are sent literally. You could verify that with nc -l localhost 8000 | hd, which says that the bytes:\n61 CF 89 62\n\nwere sent (61 == &apos;a&apos; and 62 == &apos;b&apos;).\nTherefore it is clear that:\n\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------735323031399963166993862150 sets the content type to multipart/form-data and says that the fields are separated by the given boundary string.\nBut note that the:\nboundary=---------------------------735323031399963166993862150\n\nhas two less dashes -- than the actual barrier\n-----------------------------735323031399963166993862150\n\nThis is because the standard requires the boundary to start with two dashes --. The other dashes appear to be just how Firefox chose to implement the arbitrary boundary. RFC 7578 clearly mentions that those two leading dashes -- are required:\n\n4.1.  &quot;Boundary&quot; Parameter of multipart/form-data\nAs with other multipart types, the parts are delimited with a\nboundary delimiter, constructed using CRLF, &quot;--&quot;, and the value of\nthe &quot;boundary&quot; parameter.\n\n\nevery field gets some sub headers before its data: Content-Disposition: form-data;, the field name, the filename, followed by the data.\nThe server reads the data until the next boundary string. The browser must choose a boundary that will not appear in any of the fields, so this is why the boundary may vary between requests.\nBecause we have the unique boundary, no encoding of the data is necessary: binary data is sent as is.\nTODO: what is the optimal boundary size (log(N) I bet), and name / running time of the algorithm that finds it? Asked at: https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/39687/find-the-shortest-sequence-that-is-not-a-sub-sequence-of-a-set-of-sequences\n\nContent-Type is automatically determined by the browser.\nHow it is determined exactly was asked at: How is mime type of an uploaded file determined by browser?\n\n\napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded\nNow change the enctype to application/x-www-form-urlencoded, reload the browser, and resubmit.\nFirefox sent:\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\n[[ Less interesting headers ... ]]\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: 51\n\ntext1=text+default&amp;text2=a%CF%89b&amp;file1=a.txt&amp;file2=a.html&amp;file3=binary\n\nClearly the file data was not sent, only the basenames. So this cannot be used for files.\nAs for the text field, we see that usual printable characters like a and b were sent in one byte, while non-printable ones like 0xCF and 0x89 took up 3 bytes each: %CF%89!\nComparison\nFile uploads often contain lots of non-printable characters (e.g. images), while text forms almost never do.\nFrom the examples we have seen that:\n\nmultipart/form-data: adds a few bytes of boundary overhead to the message, and must spend some time calculating it, but sends each byte in one byte.\n\napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded: has a single byte boundary per field (&amp;), but adds a linear overhead factor of 3x for every non-printable character.\n\n\nTherefore, even if we could send files with application/x-www-form-urlencoded, we wouldn&apos;t want to, because it is so inefficient.\nBut for printable characters found in text fields, it does not matter and generates less overhead, so we just use it.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"enctype=&apos;multipart/form-data is an encoding type that allows files to be sent through a POST.

An HTML page has a way to send data to the server: by using &lt;form&gt;s.\nWhen a form is submitted, an HTTP Request is created and sent to the server, the message will contain the field names in the form and the values filled in by the user. This transmission can happen with POST or GET HTTP methods.\n\nPOST tells your browser to build an HTTP message and put all content in the body of the message (a very useful way of doing things, more safe and also flexible).\nGET will submit the form data in the querystring. It has some constraints about data representation and length.\n\nStating how to send your form to the server\nAttribute enctype has sense only when using POST method. When specified, it instructs the browser to send the form by encoding its content in a specific way. From MDN - Form enctype:\n\nWhen the value of the method attribute is post, enctype is the MIME\ntype of content that is used to submit the form to the server.\n\n\napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded: This is the default. When the form is sent, all names and values are collected and URL Encoding is performed on the final string.\nmultipart/form-data: Characters are NOT encoded. This is important when the form has a file upload control. You want to send the file binary and this ensures that bitstream is not altered.\ntext/plain: Spaces get converted, but no more encoding is performed.\n\nSecurity\nWhen submitting forms, some security concerns can arise as stated in RFC 7578 Section 7: Multipart form data - Security considerations:\n\nAll form-processing software should treat user supplied form-data\nwith sensitivity, as it often contains confidential or personally\nidentifying information. There is widespread use of form &quot;auto-fill&quot;\nfeatures in web browsers; these might be used to trick users to\nunknowingly send confidential information when completing otherwise\ninnocuous tasks. multipart/form-data does not supply any features\nfor checking integrity, ensuring confidentiality, avoiding user\nconfusion, or other security features; those concerns must be\naddressed by the form-filling and form-data-interpreting applications.\nApplications that receive forms and process them must be careful\nnot to supply data back to the requesting form-processing site that\nwas not intended to be sent.\nIt is important when interpreting the filename of the Content-\nDisposition header field to not inadvertently overwrite files in the\nrecipient&apos;s file space.\n\nThis concerns you if you are a developer and your server will process forms submitted by users which might end up containing sensitive information.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"enctype=&apos;multipart/form-data&apos; means that no characters will be encoded. that is why this type is used while uploading files to server.\nSo multipart/form-data is used when a form requires binary data, like the contents of a file, to be uploaded\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Set the method attribute to POST because file content can&apos;t be put inside a URL       parameter using a form.\n\nSet the value of enctype to multipart/form-data because the data will be split into multiple parts, one for each file plus one for the text of the form body that may be sent with them.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution6","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"\nenctype(ENCode TYPE)  attribute specifies how the form-data should be encoded when submitting it to the server.  \nmultipart/form-data  is one of the value of enctype attribute, which is used in form element that have a file upload. multi-part means form data divides into multiple parts and send to server.  \n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution7","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Usually this is when you have a POST form which needs to take a file upload as data... this will tell the server how it will encode the data transferred, in such case it won&apos;t get encoded because it will just transfer and upload the files to the server, Like for example when uploading an image or a pdf\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution8","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"This value is necessary if the user will upload a file through the form\nKindly read this\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_form_enctype.asp\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution9","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"\n  The enctype attribute specifies how the form-data should be encoded when submitting it to the server.\n  \n  The enctype attribute can be used only if method=&quot;post&quot;.\n  \n  No characters are encoded.

<p>When you make a POST request, you have to encode the data that forms the body of the request in some way.</p>
<p>HTML forms provide <a href="https://www.w3.org/html/wg/spec/association-of-controls-and-forms.html#attr-fs-enctype" rel="nofollow noreferrer">three methods of encoding</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> (the default)</li>
<li><code>multipart/form-data</code></li>
<li><code>text/plain</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Work was being done on adding <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-json-forms/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>application/json</code></a>, but that has been abandoned.</p>
<p>(Other encodings are possible with HTTP requests generated using other means than an HTML form submission. JSON is a common format for use with web services and some still use SOAP.)</p>
<p>The specifics of the formats don't matter to most developers. The important points are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never use <code>text/plain</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are writing client-side code:</p>
<ul>
<li>use <code>multipart/form-data</code> when your form includes any <code>&lt;input type="file"&gt;</code> elements</li>
<li>otherwise you can use <code>multipart/form-data</code> or <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> but <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> will be more efficient</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are writing server-side code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a prewritten form handling library</li>
</ul>
<p>Most (such as Perl's <code>CGI-&gt;param</code> or the one exposed by PHP's <code>$_POST</code> superglobal) will take care of the differences for you. Don't bother trying to parse the raw input received by the server.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will find a library that can't handle both formats.  Node.js's most popular library for handling form data is <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser" rel="nofollow noreferrer">body-parser</a> which cannot handle multipart requests (but has documentation that recommends some alternatives which can).</p>
<hr>
<p>If you are writing (or debugging) a library for parsing or generating the raw data, then you need to start worrying about the format. You might also want to know about it for interest's sake.</p>
<p><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> is more or less the same as a query string on the end of the URL.</p>
<p><code>multipart/form-data</code> is significantly more complicated but it allows entire files to be included in the data. An example of the result can be found in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4" rel="nofollow noreferrer">HTML 4 specification</a>.</p>
<p><code>text/plain</code> is introduced by HTML 5 and is useful only for debugging  from <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#text/plain-encoding-algorithm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the spec</a>: <em>They are not reliably interpretable by computer</em>  and I'd argue that the others combined with tools (like <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Network Panel</a> in the developer tools of most browsers) are better for that).</p>

<p>when should we use it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/4526286">Quentin's answer</a> is right: use <code>multipart/form-data</code> if the form contains a file upload, and <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> otherwise, which is the default if you omit <code>enctype</code>.</p>
<p>I'm going to:</p>
<ul>
<li>add some more HTML5 references</li>
<li>explain <strong>why</strong> he is right with a form submit example</li>
</ul>
<h2>HTML5 references</h2>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sec-forms.html#element-attrdef-form-enctype" rel="noreferrer">three possibilities</a> for <code>enctype</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sec-forms.html#urlencoded-form-data" rel="noreferrer"><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sec-forms.html#multipart-form-data" rel="noreferrer"><code>multipart/form-data</code></a> (spec points to <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7578" rel="noreferrer">RFC7578</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sec-forms.html#plain-text-form-data" rel="noreferrer"><code>text/plain</code></a>. This is "not reliably interpretable by computer", so it should never be used in production, and we will not look further into it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to generate the examples</h2>
<p>Once you see an example of each method, it becomes obvious how they work, and when you should use each one.</p>
<p>You can produce examples using:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>nc -l</code> or an ECHO server: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5725430/http-test-server-accepting-get-post-requests/52351480#52351480">HTTP test server accepting GET/POST requests</a></li>
<li>a user agent like a browser or cURL</li>
</ul>

</code></pre>
<p>For the binary file and text field, the bytes <code>61 CF 89 62</code> (<code>aωb</code> in UTF-8) are sent literally. You could verify that with <code>nc -l localhost 8000 | hd</code>, which says that the bytes:</p>
<pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml">61 CF 89 62
</code></pre>
<p>were sent (<code>61</code> == 'a' and <code>62</code> == 'b').</p>
<p>Therefore it is clear that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------735323031399963166993862150</code> sets the content type to <code>multipart/form-data</code> and says that the fields are separated by the given <code>boundary</code> string.</p>
<p>But note that the:</p>
<pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml">boundary=---------------------------735323031399963166993862150
</code></pre>
<p>has two less dashes <code>--</code> than the actual barrier</p>
<pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml">-----------------------------735323031399963166993862150
</code></pre>
<p>This is because the standard requires the boundary to start with two dashes <code>--</code>. The other dashes appear to be just how Firefox chose to implement the arbitrary boundary. RFC 7578 <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7578#section-4.1" rel="noreferrer">clearly mentions</a> that those two leading dashes <code>--</code> are required:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4.1.  "Boundary" Parameter of multipart/form-data</p>
<p>As with other multipart types, the parts are delimited with a
boundary delimiter, constructed using CRLF, "--", and the value of
the "boundary" parameter.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>every field gets some sub headers before its data: <code>Content-Disposition: form-data;</code>, the field <code>name</code>, the <code>filename</code>, followed by the data.</p>
<p>The server reads the data until the next boundary string. The browser must choose a boundary that will not appear in any of the fields, so this is why the boundary may vary between requests.</p>
<p>Because we have the unique boundary, no encoding of the data is necessary: binary data is sent as is.</p>
<p>TODO: what is the optimal boundary size (<code>log(N)</code> I bet), and name / running time of the algorithm that finds it? Asked at: <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/39687/find-the-shortest-sequence-that-is-not-a-sub-sequence-of-a-set-of-sequences">https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/39687/find-the-shortest-sequence-that-is-not-a-sub-sequence-of-a-set-of-sequences</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Content-Type</code> is automatically determined by the browser.</p>
<p>How it is determined exactly was asked at: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1201945/how-is-mime-type-of-an-uploaded-file-determined-by-browser">How is mime type of an uploaded file determined by browser?</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</h2>
<p>Now change the <code>enctype</code> to <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>, reload the browser, and resubmit.</p>
<p>Firefox sent:</p>
<pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml">POST / HTTP/1.1

</code></pre>
<p>Clearly the file data was not sent, only the basenames. So this cannot be used for files.</p>
<p>As for the text field, we see that usual printable characters like <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> were sent in one byte, while non-printable ones like <code>0xCF</code> and <code>0x89</code> took up <strong>3 bytes</strong> each: <code>%CF%89</code>!</p>
<h2>Comparison</h2>
<p>File uploads often contain lots of non-printable characters (e.g. images), while text forms almost never do.</p>
<p>From the examples we have seen that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>multipart/form-data</code>: adds a few bytes of boundary overhead to the message, and must spend some time calculating it, but sends each byte in one byte.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>: has a single byte boundary per field (<code>&amp;</code>), but adds a <em>linear</em> overhead factor of <strong>3x</strong> for every non-printable character.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, even if we could send files with <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>, we wouldn't want to, because it is so inefficient.</p>
<p>But for printable characters found in text fields, it does not matter and generates less overhead, so we just use it.</p>

<p>When a form is submitted, an HTTP Request is created and sent to the server, the message will contain the field names in the form and the values filled in by the user. This transmission can happen with <code>POST</code> or <code>GET</code> <em>HTTP methods</em>.</p>
<ul>

<h3>Stating how to send your form to the server</h3>
<p>Attribute <code>enctype</code> has sense only when using <code>POST</code> method. When specified, it instructs the browser to send the form by encoding its content in a specific way. From <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form#attr-enctype" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MDN - Form enctype</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the value of the method attribute is post, enctype is the MIME
type of content that is used to submit the form to the server.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>: This is the default. When the form is sent, all names and values are collected and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding" rel="nofollow noreferrer">URL Encoding</a> is performed on the final string.</li>
<li><code>multipart/form-data</code>: Characters are NOT encoded. This is important when the form has a file upload control. You want to send the file binary and this ensures that bitstream is not altered.</li>
<li><code>text/plain</code>: Spaces get converted, but no more encoding is performed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>When submitting forms, some security concerns can arise as stated in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7578#section-7" rel="nofollow noreferrer">RFC 7578 Section 7: Multipart form data - Security considerations</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All form-processing software should treat user supplied form-data<br>
with sensitivity, as it often contains confidential or personally<br>
identifying information. There is widespread use of form "auto-fill"
features in web browsers; these might be used to trick users to<br>
unknowingly send confidential information when completing otherwise<br>
innocuous tasks. multipart/form-data does not supply any features<br>
for checking integrity, ensuring confidentiality, avoiding user<br>
confusion, or other security features; those concerns must be<br>
addressed by the form-filling and form-data-interpreting applications.</p>
<p>Applications that receive forms and process them must be careful
not to supply data back to the requesting form-processing site that
was not intended to be sent.</p>
<p>It is important when interpreting the filename of the Content-<br>
Disposition header field to not inadvertently overwrite files in the<br>
recipient's file space.</p>

<p>This concerns you if you are a developer and your server will process forms submitted by users which might end up containing sensitive information.</p>
