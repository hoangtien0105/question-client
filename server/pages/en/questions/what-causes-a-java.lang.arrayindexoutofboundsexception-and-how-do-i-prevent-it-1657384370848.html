Each of the boxes have an index, a position in the series of boxes. This index starts at 0, and ends at N-1, where N is the size of the array (the number of boxes).\n\nTo retrieve one of the values from this series of boxes, you can refer to it through its index, like this:\n\nmyArray[3]\n\n\nWhich will give you the value of the 4th box in the series (since the first box has index 0).\n\nAn ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is caused by trying to retrive a &quot;box&quot; that does not exist, by passing an index that is higher than the index of last &quot;box&quot;, or negative.\n\nWith my running example, these code snippets would produce such an exception:\n\nmyArray[5] //tries to retrieve the 6th &quot;box&quot; when there is only 5\nmyArray[-1] //just makes no sense\nmyArray[1337] //waay to high\n\n\nHow to avoid ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException\n\nIn order to prevent ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, there are some key points to consider:\n\nLooping\n\nWhen looping through an array, always make sure that the index you are retrieving is strictly smaller than the length of the array (the number of boxes). For instance:\n\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; myArray.length; i++) {\n\n\nNotice the &lt;, never mix a = in there..\n\nYou might want to be tempted to do something like this:\n\nfor (int i = 1; i &lt;= myArray.length; i++) {\n    final int someint = myArray[i - 1]\n\n\nJust don&apos;t. Stick to the one above (if you need to use the index) and it will save you a lot of pain.\n\nWhere possible, use foreach:\n\nfor (int value : myArray) {\n\n\nThis way you won&apos;t have to think about indexes at all.\n\nWhen looping, whatever you do, NEVER change the value of the loop iterator (here: i). The only place this should change value is to keep the loop going. Changing it otherwise is just risking an exception, and is in most cases not neccessary.\n\nRetrieval/update\n\nWhen retrieving an arbitrary element of the array, always check that it is a valid index against the length of the array:\n\npublic Integer getArrayElement(final int index) {\n    if (index &lt; 0 || index &gt;= myArray.length) {\n        return null; //although I would much prefer an actual exception being thrown when this happens.\n    }\n    return myArray[index];\n}\n\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/what-causes-a-java.lang.arrayindexoutofboundsexception-and-how-do-i-prevent-it-1657384370848#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"To avoid an array index out-of-bounds exception, one should use the enhanced-for statement where and when they can.\n\nThe primary motivation (and use case) is when you are iterating and you do not require any complicated iteration steps.

<p>Your first port of call should be the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.html" rel="noreferrer">documentation</a> which explains it reasonably clearly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index. The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So for example:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">int</span>[] array = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">int</span>[<span class="hljs-number">5</span>];
<span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">boom</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> array[<span class="hljs-number">10</span>]; <span class="hljs-comment">// Throws the exception</span>
</code></pre>

<p>As for how to avoid it... um, don't do that. Be careful with your array indexes.</p>

<p>One problem people sometimes run into is thinking that arrays are 1-indexed, e.g.</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">int</span>[] array = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">int</span>[<span class="hljs-number">5</span>];
<span class="hljs-comment">// ... populate the array here ...</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">index</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>; index &lt;= array.length; index++)
{
    System.out.println(array[index]);
}

<p>That will miss out the first element (index 0) and throw an exception when index is 5. The valid indexes here are 0-4 inclusive. The correct, idiomatic <code>for</code> statement here would be:</p>

<p>(That's assuming you <em>need</em> the index, of course. If you can use the enhanced for loop instead, do so.)</p>

<p><strong>What causes <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>?</strong></p>

<p>If you think of a variable as a "box" where you can place a value, then an array is a series of boxes placed next to eachother, where the number of boxes is a finite and explicit integer.</p>

<p>Creating an array like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">final</span> <span class="hljs-type">int</span>[] myArray = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">int</span>[<span class="hljs-number">5</span>]
</code></pre>

<p>creates a row of 5 boxes, each holding an <code>int</code>. Each of the boxes have an index, a position in the series of boxes. This index starts at 0, and ends at N-1, where N is the size of the array (the number of boxes).</p>

<p>To retrieve one of the values from this series of boxes, you can refer to it through its index, like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">myArray[<span class="hljs-number">3</span>]
</code></pre>

<p>Which will give you the value of the 4th box in the series (since the first box has index 0).</p>

<p>An <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code> is caused by trying to retrive a "box" that does not exist, by passing an index that is higher than the index of last "box", or negative.</p>

<p>With my running example, these code snippets would produce such an exception:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">myArray[<span class="hljs-number">5</span>] <span class="hljs-comment">//tries to retrieve the 6th "box" when there is only 5</span>
myArray[-<span class="hljs-number">1</span>] <span class="hljs-comment">//just makes no sense</span>
myArray[<span class="hljs-number">1337</span>] <span class="hljs-comment">//waay to high</span>
</code></pre>

<p><strong>How to avoid <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code></strong></p>

<p>In order to prevent <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>, there are some key points to consider:</p>

<p><strong>Looping</strong></p>

<p>When looping through an array, always make sure that the index you are retrieving is strictly smaller than the length of the array (the number of boxes). For instance:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">i</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; myArray.length; i++) {
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the <code>&lt;</code>, never mix a <code>=</code> in there..</p>

<p>You might want to be tempted to do something like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">i</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>; i &lt;= myArray.length; i++) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">final</span> <span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">someint</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> myArray[i - <span class="hljs-number">1</span>]
</code></pre>

<p>Just don't. Stick to the one above (if you need to use the index) and it will save you a lot of pain.</p>

<p>Where possible, use foreach:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-type">int</span> value : myArray) {
</code></pre>

<p>This way you won't have to think about indexes at all.</p>

<p>When looping, whatever you do, NEVER change the value of the loop iterator (here: <code>i</code>). The only place this should change value is to keep the loop going. Changing it otherwise is just risking an exception, and is in most cases not neccessary.</p>

<p><strong>Retrieval/update</strong></p>

<p>When retrieving an arbitrary element of the array, always check that it is a valid index against the length of the array:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> Integer <span class="hljs-title function_">getArrayElement</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">final</span> <span class="hljs-type">int</span> index)</span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (index &lt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span> || index &gt;= myArray.length) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">//although I would much prefer an actual exception being thrown when this happens.</span>
    }
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> myArray[index];
}
</code></pre>

<p>To avoid an array index out-of-bounds exception, one should use the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/for.html" rel="noreferrer">enhanced-<code>for</code></a> statement where and when they can.</p>

<p>The primary motivation (and use case) is when you are iterating and you do not require any complicated iteration steps.  You would <em>not</em> be able to use an enhanced-<code>for</code> to move backwards in an array or only iterate on every other element.</p>

<p>You're guaranteed not to run out of elements to iterate over when doing this, and your [corrected] example is easily converted over.</p>

<p>The code below:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">String[] name = {<span class="hljs-string">"tom"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"dick"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"harry"</span>};

    System.out.print(name[i] + <span class="hljs-string">"\n"</span>);
}
</code></pre>

<p>...is equivalent to this:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">String[] name = {<span class="hljs-string">"tom"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"dick"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"harry"</span>};

<p>In your code you have accessed the elements from index 0 to the length of the string array. <code>name.length</code> gives the number of string objects in your array of string objects i.e. 3, but you can access only up to index 2 <code>name[2]</code>,
because the array can be accessed from index 0 to <code>name.length - 1</code> where you get <code>name.length</code> number of objects.</p>
<p>Even while using a <code>for</code> loop you have started with index zero and you should end with <code>name.length - 1</code>. In an array a[n] you can access form a[0] to a[n-1].</p>
<p>For example:</p>

<p>That's how this type of exception looks when thrown in Eclipse. The number in red signifies the index you tried to access. So the code would look like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">myArray[<span class="hljs-number">5</span>]
</code></pre>

<p>The error is thrown when you try to access an index which doesn't exist in that array. If an array has a length of 3,</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">int</span>[] intArray = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">int</span>[<span class="hljs-number">3</span>];
</code></pre>

<p>then the only valid indexes are:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">intArray[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]
intArray[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]
intArray[<span class="hljs-number">2</span>]
</code></pre>

<p>If an array has a length of 1,</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">int</span>[] intArray = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">int</span>[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>];
</code></pre>

<p>then the only valid index is:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">intArray[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>]
</code></pre>

<p>Any integer equal to the length of the array, or bigger than it: is out of bounds.</p>

<p>Any integer less than 0: is out of bounds;</p>

<p>Each dimension has a different length, so the subtle bug is that the middle and inner loops use the <code>length</code> property of the same dimension (because <code>a[i].length</code> is the same as <code>a[j].length</code>).</p>

<p>Instead, the inner loop should use <code>a[i][j].length</code> (or <code>a[0][0].length</code>, for simplicity).</p>

<p>The most common case I've seen for seemingly mysterious ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions, i.e. apparently not caused by your own array handling code, is the concurrent use of SimpleDateFormat. Particularly in a servlet or controller:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">MyController</span> {

    <span class="hljs-type">Date</span> <span class="hljs-variable">date</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> dateFormat.parse(req.getParameter(<span class="hljs-string">"date"</span>));
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If two threads enter the SimplateDateFormat.parse() method together you will likely see an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Note the synchronization section of the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">class javadoc for SimpleDateFormat</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure there is no place in your code that are accessing thread unsafe classes like SimpleDateFormat in a concurrent manner like in a servlet or controller. Check all instance variables of your servlets and controllers for likely suspects.</p>

<p>If your program is trying to access any element (or memory) having array index greater than n-1, then Java will throw <strong>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</strong></p>

<p>So here are two solutions that we can use in a program</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Maintaining count:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">count</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; count &lt; array.length; count++) {

<p>Or some other looping statement like</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-variable">count</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span>(count &lt; array.length) {
    System.out.println(array[count]);
    count++;
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>A better way go with a for each loop, in this method a programmer has no need to bother about the number of elements in the array.</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(String str : array) {
    System.out.println(str);

<p>ArrayIndexOutOfBounds means you are trying to index a position within an array that is not allocated.</p>

<p>In this case:</p>

<ul>
<li>name.length is 3 since the array has been defined with 3 String objects.</li>
<li>When accessing the contents of an array, position starts from 0. Since there are 3 items, it would mean name[0]="tom", name[1]="dick" and name[2]="harry</li>
<li>When you loop, since <em>i</em> can be less than or equal to name.length, you are trying to access name[3] which is not available.</li>
</ul>

<p>To get around this... </p>

<ul>
<li><p>In your for loop, you can do i &lt; name.length. This would prevent looping to name[3] and would instead stop at name[2]</p>

<p><code>for(int i = 0; i&lt;name.length; i++)</code></p></li>
<li><p>Use a for each loop</p>

<p><code>String[] name = { "tom", "dick", "harry" };
for(String n : name) {
    System.out.println(n);
}</code></p></li>
<li><p>Use list.forEach(Consumer action) (requires Java8)</p>

<p><code>String[] name = { "tom", "dick", "harry" };
Arrays.asList(name).forEach(System.out::println);</code></p></li>
<li><p>Convert array to stream - this is a good option if you want to perform additional 'operations' to your array e.g. filter, transform the text, convert to a map etc (requires Java8)</p>

<p><code>String[] name = { "tom", "dick", "harry" };

<p>I see all the answers here explaining how to work with arrays and how to avoid the index out of bounds exceptions.  I personally avoid arrays at all costs.  I use the Collections classes, which avoids all the silliness of having to deal with array indices entirely.  The looping constructs work beautifully with collections supporting code that is both easier to write, understand and maintain.</p>

When loop is running 'i' time , print the (numberArray[i+1] element..(when i value is 1, numberArray[i+1] element is printed.)..Suppose that, when i=(numberArray.length-2), last element of array is printed..When 'i' value goes to (numberArray.length-1) , no value for printing..In that point , 'ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException' is occur.I hope to you could get idea.thank you !</p>
