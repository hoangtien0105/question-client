You should always put publicly reuseable Java classes in a package, otherwise they are invisible to classes which are in a package, such as the server itself. This way you eliminate potential environment-specific problems. Packageless servlets work only in specific Tomcat+JDK combinations and this should never be relied upon.\nIn case of a &quot;plain&quot; IDE project, the class needs to be placed in its package structure inside the &quot;Java Sources&quot; folder, not inside &quot;Web Content&quot; folder, which is for web files such as JSP. Below is an example of the folder structure of a default Eclipse Dynamic Web Project as seen in Navigator view (the &quot;Java Sources&quot; folder is in such project by default represented by src folder):\nEclipseProjectName\n |-- src\n |    `-- com\n |         `-- example\n |              `-- YourServlet.java\n |-- WebContent\n |    |-- WEB-INF\n |    |    `-- web.xml\n |    `-- jsps\n |         `-- page.jsp\n :\n\nIn case of a Maven project, the class needs to be placed in its package structure inside main/java and thus not main/resources, this is for non-class files and absolutely also not main/webapp, this is for web files. Below is an example of the folder structure of a default Maven webapp project as seen in Eclipse&apos;s Navigator view:\nMavenProjectName\n |-- src\n |    `-- main\n |         |-- java\n |         |    `-- com\n |         |         `-- example\n |         |              `-- YourServlet.java\n |         |-- resources\n |         `-- webapp\n |              |-- WEB-INF\n |              |    `-- web.xml\n |              `-- jsps\n |                   `-- page.jsp\n :\n\nNote that the /jsps subfolder is not strictly necessary. You can even do without it and put the JSP file directly in webcontent/webapp root, but I&apos;m just taking over this from your question.\nSet servlet URL in url-pattern\nThe servlet URL is specified as the &quot;URL pattern&quot; of the servlet mapping. It&apos;s absolutely not per definition the classname/filename of the servlet class. The URL pattern is to be specified as value of @WebServlet annotation.\npackage com.example; // Use a package!\n\nimport jakarta.servlet.annotation.WebServlet; // or javax.*\nimport jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet; // or javax.*\n\n@WebServlet(&quot;/servlet&quot;) // This is the URL of the servlet.\npublic class YourServlet extends HttpServlet { // Must be public and extend HttpServlet.\n    // ...\n}\n\nIn case you want to support path parameters like /servlet/foo/bar, then use an URL pattern of /servlet/* instead. See also Servlet and path parameters like /xyz/{value}/test, how to map in web.xml?\n@WebServlet works only on Servlet 3.0 or newer\nIn order to use @WebServlet, you only need to make sure that your web.xml file, if any (it&apos;s optional since Servlet 3.0), is declared conform Servlet 3.0+ version and thus not conform e.g. 2.5 version or lower. Below is a Servlet 5.0 compatible one (which matches Tomcat 10+, WildFly 22+ (Preview), GlassFish/Payara 6+, etc).\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;web-app \n    xmlns=&quot;https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee&quot;\n    xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\n    xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/web-app_5_0.xsd&quot;\n    version=&quot;5.0&quot;&gt;\n\n    &lt;!-- Config here. --&gt;\n&lt;/web-app&gt;\n\nAnd below is a Servlet 4.0 compatible one (which matches Tomcat 9+, WildFly 11+, GlassFish/Payara 5+, etc).\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\n&lt;web-app\n    xmlns=&quot;http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee&quot;\n    xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\n    xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_4_0.xsd&quot;\n    version=&quot;4.0&quot;\n&gt;\n    &lt;!-- Config here. --&gt;\n&lt;/web-app&gt;\n\nOr, in case you&apos;re not on Servlet 3.0+ yet (e.g. Tomcat 6 or older), then remove the @WebServlet annotation.\npackage com.example;\n\nimport javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;\n\npublic class YourServlet extends HttpServlet {\n    // ...\n}\n\nAnd register the servlet instead in web.xml like this:\n&lt;servlet&gt;\n    &lt;servlet-name&gt;yourServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\n    &lt;servlet-class&gt;com.example.YourServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;\n&lt;/servlet&gt;\n&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;\n    &lt;servlet-name&gt;yourServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\n    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/servlet&lt;/url-pattern&gt;  &lt;!-- This is the URL of the servlet. --&gt;\n&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;\n\nNote thus that you should not use both ways. Use either annotation based configuarion or XML based configuration. When you have both, then XML based configuration will override annotation based configuration.\njavax.servlet.* doesn&apos;t work anymore in Servlet 5.0 or newer\nSince Jakarta EE 9 / Servlet 5.0 (Tomcat 10, TomEE 9, WildFly 22 Preview, GlassFish 6, Payara 6, Liberty 22, etc), the javax.* package has been renamed to jakarta.* package.\nIn other words, please make absolutely sure that you don&apos;t randomly put JAR files of a different server in your WAR project such as tomcat-servlet-api-9.x.x.jar merely in order to get the javax.* package to compile. This will only cause trouble. Remove it altogether and edit the imports of your servlet class from\nimport javax.servlet.*;\nimport javax.servlet.annotation.*;\nimport javax.servlet.http.*;\n\nto\nimport jakarta.servlet.*;\nimport jakarta.servlet.annotation.*;\nimport jakarta.servlet.http.*;\n\nIn case you&apos;re using Maven, you can find examples of proper pom.xml declarations for Tomcat 10+, Tomcat 9-, JEE 9+ and JEE 8- in this answer: Tomcat casting servlets to javax.servlet.Servlet instead of jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet. The alternative is to downgrade the server to an older version, e.g. from Tomcat 10 back to Tomcat 9 or older, but this is clearly not the recommended way to go.\nMake sure compiled *.class file is present in built WAR\nIn case you&apos;re using a build tool such as Eclipse and/or Maven, then you need to make absolutely sure that the compiled servlet class file resides in its package structure in /WEB-INF/classes folder of the produced WAR file. In case of package com.example; public class YourServlet, it must be located in /WEB-INF/classes/com/example/YourServlet.class. Otherwise you will face in case of @WebServlet also a 404 error, or in case of &lt;servlet&gt; a HTTP 500 error like below:\n\nHTTP Status 500\nError instantiating servlet class com.example.YourServlet\n\nAnd find in the server log a java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.example.YourServlet, followed by a java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com.example.YourServlet, in turn followed by jakarta.servlet.ServletException: Error instantiating servlet class com.example.YourServlet.\nAn easy way to verify if the servlet is correctly compiled and placed in classpath is to let the build tool produce a WAR file (e.g. rightclick project, Export &gt; WAR file in Eclipse) and then inspect its contents with a ZIP tool. If the servlet class is missing in /WEB-INF/classes, or if the export causes an error, then the project is badly configured or some IDE/project configuration defaults have been mistakenly reverted (e.g. Project &gt; Build Automatically has been disabled in Eclipse).\nYou also need to make sure that the project icon has no red cross indicating a build error. You can find the exact error in Problems  view (Window &gt; Show View &gt; Other...). Usually the error message is fine Googlable. In case you have no clue, best is to restart from scratch and do not touch any IDE/project configuration defaults. In case you&apos;re using Eclipse, you can find instructions in How do I import the javax.servlet / jakarta.servlet API in my Eclipse project?\nTest the servlet individually without any JSP/HTML page\nProvided that the server runs on localhost:8080, and that the WAR is successfully deployed on a context path of /contextname (which defaults to the IDE project name, case sensitive!), and the servlet hasn&apos;t failed its initialization (read server logs for any deploy/servlet success/fail messages and the actual context path and servlet mapping), then a servlet with URL pattern of /servlet is available at http://localhost:8080/contextname/servlet.\nYou can just enter it straight in browser&apos;s address bar to test it invidivually. If its doGet() is properly overriden and implemented, then you will see its output in browser. Or if you don&apos;t have any doGet() or if it incorrectly calls super.doGet(), then a &quot;HTTP 405: HTTP method GET is not supported by this URL&quot; error will be shown (which is still better than a 404 as a 405 is evidence that the servlet itself is actually found).\nOverriding service() is a bad practice, unless you&apos;re reinventing a MVC framework  which is very unlikely if you&apos;re just starting out with servlets and are clueless as to the problem described in the current question ;) See also Design Patterns web based applications.\nRegardless, if the servlet already returns 404 when tested invidivually, then it&apos;s entirely pointless to try with a HTML form instead. Logically, it&apos;s therefore also entirely pointless to include any HTML form in questions about 404 errors from a servlet.\nUse domain-relative URL to reference servlet from HTML\nOnce you&apos;ve verified that the servlet works fine when invoked individually, then you can advance to HTML. As to your concrete problem with the HTML form, the &lt;form action&gt; value needs to be a valid URL. The same applies to &lt;a href&gt;, &lt;img src&gt;, &lt;script src&gt;, etc. You need to understand how absolute/relative URLs work. You know, an URL is a web address as you can enter/see in the webbrowser&apos;s address bar. If you&apos;re specifying a relative URL as form action, i.e. without the http:// scheme, then it becomes relative to the current URL as you see in your webbrowser&apos;s address bar. It&apos;s thus absolutely not relative to the JSP/HTML file location in server&apos;s WAR folder structure as many starters seem to think.\nSo, assuming that the JSP page with the HTML form is opened by http://localhost:8080/contextname/jsps/page.jsp (and thus not by file://...), and you need to submit to a servlet located in http://localhost:8080/contextname/servlet, here are several cases (note that you can here safely substitute &lt;form action&gt; with &lt;a href&gt;, &lt;img src&gt;, &lt;script src&gt;, etc):\n\nForm action submits to an URL with a leading slash.\n    &lt;form action=&quot;/servlet&quot;&gt;\n\nThe leading slash / makes the URL relative to the domain, thus the form will submit to\n    http://localhost:8080/servlet\n\nBut this will likely result in a 404 as it&apos;s in the wrong context.\n\n\nForm action submits to an URL without a leading slash.\n    &lt;form action=&quot;servlet&quot;&gt;\n\nThis makes the URL relative to the current folder of the current URL, thus the form will submit to\n    http://localhost:8080/contextname/jsps/servlet\n\nBut this will likely result in a 404 as it&apos;s in the wrong folder.\n\n\nForm action submits to an URL which goes one folder up.\n    &lt;form action=&quot;../servlet&quot;&gt;\n\nThis will go one folder up (exactly like as in local disk file system paths!), thus the form will submit to\n    http://localhost:8080/contextname/servlet\n\nThis one must work!\n\n\nThe canonical approach, however, is to make the URL domain-relative so that you don&apos;t need to fix the URLs once again when you happen to move the JSP files around into another folder.\n    &lt;form action=&quot;${pageContext.request.contextPath}/servlet&quot;&gt;\n\nThis will generate\n    &lt;form action=&quot;/contextname/servlet&quot;&gt;\n\nWhich will thus always submit to the right URL.\n\n\n\nUse straight quotes in HTML attributes\nYou need to make absolutely sure you&apos;re using straight quotes in HTML attributes like action=&quot;...&quot; or action=&apos;...&apos; and thus not curly quotes like action=... or action=.... Curly quotes are not supported in HTML and they will simply become part of the value. Watch out when copy-pasting code snippets from blogs! Some blog engines, notably Wordpress, are known to by default use so-called &quot;smart quotes&quot; which thus also corrupts the quotes in code snippets this way. On the other hand, instead of copy-pasting code, try simply typing over the code yourself. Additional advantage of actually getting the code through your brain and fingers is that it will make you to remember and understand the code much better in long term and also make you a better developer.\nSee also:\n\nOur servlets wiki page - Contains some hello world examples\nHow to call servlet class from HTML form\ndoGet and doPost in Servlets\nHow do I pass current item to Java method by clicking a hyperlink or button in JSP page?\n\nOther cases of HTTP Status 404 error:\n\nHTTP Status 404 - Servlet [ServletName] is not available\nHTTP Status 404 - The requested resource (/ProjectName/) is not available\nHTTP Status 404 - The requested resource (/) is not available\nJSP in /WEB-INF returns &quot;HTTP Status 404 The requested resource is not available&quot;\nReferencing a resource placed in WEB-INF folder in JSP file returns HTTP 404 on resource\nBrowser can&apos;t access/find relative resources like CSS, images and links when calling a Servlet which forwards to a JSP\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Scenario #1: You accidentially re-deployed from the command line while tomcat was already running.\n\nShort Answer: Stop Tomcat, delete target folder, mvn package, then re-deploy\n\n\n\nScenario #2: request.getRequestDispatcher(&quot;MIS_SPELLED_FILE_NAME.jsp&quot;)\n\nShort Answer: Check file name spelling, make sure case is correct.\n\n\n\nScenario #3: Class Not Found Exceptions\n(Answer put here because: Question# 17982240  )\n(java.lang.ClassNotFoundException for servlet in tomcat with eclipse )\n(was marked as duplicate and directed me here )\n\nShort Answer #3.1: web.xml has wrong package path in servlet-class tag.\n\nShort Answer #3.2: java file has wrong import statement.\n\n\n\nBelow is further details for Scenario #1:\n\n\n\n1: Stop Tomcat\n\n\nOption 1: Via CTRL+C in terminal.\nOption 2: (terminal closed while tomcat still running)\n------------ 2.1: press:Windows+R --&gt; type:&quot;services.msc&quot;\n------------ 2.2: Find &quot;Apache Tomcat #.# Tomcat#&quot; in Name column of list.\n------------ 2.3: Right Click --&gt; &quot;stop&quot;\n\n\n2: Delete the &quot;target&quot; folder.\n(mvn clean will not help you here)\n\n3: mvn package\n\n4: YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_COMMAND_HERE\n\n(Mine: java -jar target/dependency/webapp-runner.jar --port 5190 target/*.war )\n\nFull Back Story:\n\n\n\nAccidentially opened a new git-bash window and\ntried to deploy a .war file for my heroku project via:\n\njava -jar target/dependency/webapp-runner.jar --port 5190 target/*.war\n\nAfter a failure to deploy, I realized I had two git-bash windows open,\nand had not used CTLR+C to stop the previous deployment.\n\nI was met with:\n\n\n  HTTP Status 404  Not Found Type Status Report\n  \n  Message /if-student-test.jsp\n  \n  Description The origin server  did not find a current representation\n  for  the target resource or is not willing  to disclose that one\n  exists.\n  \n  Apache Tomcat/8.5.31\n\n\nBelow is further details for Scenario #3:\n\n\n\nSCENARIO 3.1:\n   The servlet-class package path is wrong \n   in your web.xml file.\n\nIt should MATCH the package statement at top\n   of your java servlet class.\n\nFile: my_stuff/MyClass.java:\n\n   package my_stuff;\n\n\nFile: PRJ_ROOT/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml\n\n   &lt;servlet-class&gt;\n   my_stuff.MyClass\n   &lt;/servlet-class&gt;\n\n\nSCENARIO 3.2:\n\nYou put the wrong &quot;package&quot; statement\n   at top of your myClass.java file.\n\nFor example:\n\nFile is in: &quot;/my_stuff&quot; folder\n\nYou mistakenly write:\n\npackage com.my_stuff\n\n\nThis is tricky because:\n\n1: The maven build (mvn package) will not report any errors here.\n\n2: servlet-class line in web.xml can have CORRECT package path.

<p>I have tried several URLs in <code>action</code> attribute of the HTML form:</p>
<pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">form</span> <span class="hljs-attr">action</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"/servlet"</span>&gt;</span>

<p>But none of those work. They all keep returning a HTTP 404 error like below in Tomcat 6/7/8:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>HTTP Status 404 — /servlet</h3>
<p><em>Description</em>: The requested resource (/servlet) is not available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or as below in Tomcat 8.5/9:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>HTTP Status 404 — Not Found</h3>
<p><em>Message</em>: /servlet</p>
<p><em>Description</em>: The origin server did not find a current representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or as below in Tomcat 10:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>HTTP Status 404 — Not Found</h3>
<p><em>Type</em>: Status Report</p>
<p><em>Message</em>: The requested resource (/servlet) is not available</p>
<p><em>Description</em>: The origin server did not find a current representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists</p>

<p>Why is it not working?</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This can have a lot of causes which are broken down in following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Put servlet class in a <code>package</code></li>
<li>Set servlet URL in <code>url-pattern</code></li>
<li><code>@WebServlet</code> works only on Servlet 3.0 or newer</li>
<li><code>javax.servlet.*</code> doesn't work anymore in Servlet 5.0 or newer</li>
<li>Make sure compiled <code>*.class</code> file is present in built WAR</li>
<li>Test the servlet individually without any JSP/HTML page</li>
<li>Use domain-relative URL to reference servlet from HTML</li>
<li>Use straight quotes in HTML attributes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Put servlet class in a <code>package</code></h2>
<p>First of all, put the servlet class in a Java <code>package</code>. You should <em>always</em> put publicly reuseable Java classes in a package, otherwise they are invisible to classes which are in a package, such as the server itself. This way you eliminate potential environment-specific problems. Packageless servlets work only in specific Tomcat+JDK combinations and this should never be relied upon.</p>
<p>In case of a "plain" IDE project, the class needs to be placed in its package structure inside the "Java Sources" folder, <em>not</em> inside "Web Content" folder, which is for web files such as JSP. Below is an example of the folder structure of a default Eclipse <em>Dynamic Web Project</em> as seen in <em>Navigator</em> view (the "Java Sources" folder is in such project by default represented by <code>src</code> folder):</p>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>EclipseProjectName
 |-- src
 |    `-- com
 |         `-- example
 |              `-- YourServlet.java
 |-- WebContent
 |    |-- WEB-INF
 |    |    `-- web.xml
 |    `-- jsps
 |         `-- page.jsp
 :
</code></pre>
<p>In case of a Maven project, the class needs to be placed in its package structure inside <code>main/java</code> and thus <em>not</em> <code>main/resources</code>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31051494/how-to-link-a-css-resource-file-in-main-resources-in-jsp/">this is for non-class files</a> and absolutely also <em>not</em> <code>main/webapp</code>, this is for web files. Below is an example of the folder structure of a default Maven webapp project as seen in Eclipse's <em>Navigator</em> view:</p>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>MavenProjectName
 |-- src
 |    `-- main
 |         |-- java
 |         |    `-- com
 |         |         `-- example
 |         |              `-- YourServlet.java
 |         |-- resources
 |         `-- webapp
 |              |-- WEB-INF
 |              |    `-- web.xml
 |              `-- jsps
 |                   `-- page.jsp
 :
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>/jsps</code> subfolder is not strictly necessary. You can even do without it and put the JSP file directly in webcontent/webapp root, but I'm just taking over this from your question.</p>
<h2>Set servlet URL in <code>url-pattern</code></h2>
<p>The servlet URL is specified as the "URL pattern" of the servlet mapping. It's absolutely not per definition the classname/filename of the servlet class. The URL pattern is to be specified as value of <code>@WebServlet</code> annotation.</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">package</span> com.example; <span class="hljs-comment">// Use a package!</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> jakarta.servlet.annotation.WebServlet; <span class="hljs-comment">// or javax.*</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet; <span class="hljs-comment">// or javax.*</span>

<span class="hljs-meta">@WebServlet("/servlet")</span> <span class="hljs-comment">// This is the URL of the servlet.</span>

    <span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>In case you want to support path parameters like <code>/servlet/foo/bar</code>, then use an URL pattern of <code>/servlet/*</code> instead. See also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8715474/servlet-and-path-parameters-like-xyz-value-test-how-to-map-in-web-xml">Servlet and path parameters like /xyz/{value}/test, how to map in web.xml?</a></p>
<h2><code>@WebServlet</code> works only on Servlet 3.0 or newer</h2>
<p>In order to use <code>@WebServlet</code>, you only need to make sure that your <code>web.xml</code> file, if any (it's optional since Servlet 3.0), is declared conform Servlet 3.0+ version <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6535676/webservlet-annotation-with-tomcat-7">and thus <em>not</em> conform e.g. 2.5 version or lower</a>. Below is a Servlet 5.0 compatible one (which matches Tomcat 10+, WildFly 22+ (Preview), GlassFish/Payara 6+, etc).</p>
<pre class="lang-xml s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?xml version=<span class="hljs-string">"1.0"</span> encoding=<span class="hljs-string">"UTF-8"</span>?&gt;</span>

<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">web-app</span>&gt;</span>

<p>And below is a Servlet 4.0 compatible one (which matches Tomcat 9+, WildFly 11+, GlassFish/Payara 5+, etc).</p>
<pre class="lang-xml s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?xml version=<span class="hljs-string">"1.0"</span> encoding=<span class="hljs-string">"UTF-8"</span>?&gt;</span>

<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">web-app</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Or, in case you're not on Servlet 3.0+ yet (e.g. Tomcat 6 or older), then remove the <code>@WebServlet</code> annotation.</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">package</span> com.example;

<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;

</code></pre>
<p>And register the servlet instead in <code>web.xml</code> like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-xml s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">servlet</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">servlet-name</span>&gt;</span>yourServlet<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">servlet-name</span>&gt;</span>

<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">servlet-mapping</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Note thus that you should not use both ways. Use either annotation based configuarion or XML based configuration. When you have both, then XML based configuration will override annotation based configuration.</p>
<h2><code>javax.servlet.*</code> doesn't work anymore in Servlet 5.0 or newer</h2>
<p>Since Jakarta EE 9 / Servlet 5.0 (Tomcat 10, TomEE 9, WildFly 22 Preview, GlassFish 6, Payara 6, Liberty 22, etc), the <code>javax.*</code> package has been renamed to <code>jakarta.*</code> package.</p>
<p>In other words, please make absolutely sure that you don't randomly put JAR files of a different server in your WAR project such as tomcat-servlet-api-9.x.x.jar merely in order to get the <code>javax.*</code> package to compile. This will only cause trouble. Remove it altogether and edit the imports of your servlet class from</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> javax.servlet.*;
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> javax.servlet.annotation.*;

<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> jakarta.servlet.annotation.*;
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> jakarta.servlet.http.*;
</code></pre>
<p>In case you're using Maven, you can find examples of proper <code>pom.xml</code> declarations for Tomcat 10+, Tomcat 9-, JEE 9+ and JEE 8- in this answer: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65703840/tomcat-9-casting-servlets-to-javax-servlet-servlet-instead-of-jakarta-servlet-ht/65704617#65704617">Tomcat casting servlets to javax.servlet.Servlet instead of jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet</a>. The alternative is to downgrade the server to an older version, e.g. from Tomcat 10 back to Tomcat 9 or older, but this is clearly not the recommended way to go.</p>
<h2>Make sure compiled <code>*.class</code> file is present in built WAR</h2>
<p>In case you're using a build tool such as Eclipse and/or Maven, then you need to make absolutely sure that the compiled servlet class file resides in its package structure in <code>/WEB-INF/classes</code> folder of the produced WAR file. In case of <code>package com.example; public class YourServlet</code>, it must be located in <code>/WEB-INF/classes/com/example/YourServlet.class</code>. Otherwise you will face in case of <code>@WebServlet</code> also a 404 error, or in case of <code>&lt;servlet&gt;</code> a HTTP 500 error like below:</p>
<blockquote>
<h1>HTTP Status 500</h1>
<p>Error instantiating servlet class com.example.YourServlet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And find in the server log a <code>java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.example.YourServlet</code>, followed by a <code>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com.example.YourServlet</code>, in turn followed by <code>jakarta.servlet.ServletException: Error instantiating servlet class com.example.YourServlet</code>.</p>
<p>An easy way to verify if the servlet is correctly compiled and placed in classpath is to let the build tool produce a WAR file (e.g. rightclick project, <em>Export &gt; WAR file</em> in Eclipse) and then inspect its contents with a ZIP tool. If the servlet class is missing in <code>/WEB-INF/classes</code>, or if the export causes an error, then the project is badly configured or some IDE/project configuration defaults have been mistakenly reverted (e.g. <em>Project &gt; Build Automatically</em> has been disabled in Eclipse).</p>
<p>You also need to make sure that the project icon has no red cross indicating a build error. You can find the exact error in <em>Problems</em>  view (<em>Window &gt; Show View &gt; Other...</em>). Usually the error message is fine Googlable. In case you have no clue, best is to restart from scratch and do not touch any IDE/project configuration defaults. In case you're using Eclipse, you can find instructions in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4076601/how-do-i-import-the-javax-servlet-api-in-my-eclipse-project">How do I import the javax.servlet / jakarta.servlet API in my Eclipse project?</a></p>
<h2>Test the servlet individually without any JSP/HTML page</h2>
<p>Provided that the server runs on <code>localhost:8080</code>, and that the WAR is successfully deployed on a context path of <code>/contextname</code> (which defaults to the IDE project name, case sensitive!), and the servlet hasn't failed its initialization (read server logs for any deploy/servlet success/fail messages and the actual context path and servlet mapping), then a servlet with URL pattern of <code>/servlet</code> is available at <code>http://localhost:8080/contextname/servlet</code>.</p>
<p>You can just enter it straight in browser's address bar to test it invidivually. If its <code>doGet()</code> is properly overriden and implemented, then you will see its output in browser. Or if you don't have any <code>doGet()</code> or if it incorrectly calls <code>super.doGet()</code>, then a "<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5370633/405-http-method-get-is-not-supported-by-this-url">HTTP 405: HTTP method GET is not supported by this URL</a>" error will be shown (which is still better than a 404 as a 405 is evidence that the servlet itself is actually found).</p>
<p>Overriding <code>service()</code> is a bad practice, unless you're reinventing a MVC framework  which is very unlikely if you're just starting out with servlets and are clueless as to the problem described in the current question ;) See also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3541077/design-patterns-web-based-applications">Design Patterns web based applications</a>.</p>
<p>Regardless, if the servlet already returns 404 when tested invidivually, then it's entirely pointless to try with a HTML form instead. Logically, it's therefore also entirely pointless to include any HTML form in questions about 404 errors from a servlet.</p>
<h2>Use domain-relative URL to reference servlet from HTML</h2>
<p>Once you've verified that the servlet works fine when invoked individually, then you can advance to HTML. As to your concrete problem with the HTML form, the <code>&lt;form action&gt;</code> value needs to be a valid URL. The same applies to <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;img src&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;script src&gt;</code>, etc. You need to understand how absolute/relative URLs work. You know, an URL is a web address as you can enter/see in the webbrowser's address bar. If you're specifying a relative URL as form action, i.e. without the <code>http://</code> scheme, then it becomes relative to the <em>current</em> URL as you see in your webbrowser's address bar. It's thus absolutely not relative to the JSP/HTML file location in server's WAR folder structure as many starters seem to think.</p>
<p>So, assuming that the JSP page with the HTML form is opened by <code>http://localhost:8080/contextname/jsps/page.jsp</code> (and thus <strong>not</strong> by <code>file://...</code>), and you need to submit to a servlet located in <code>http://localhost:8080/contextname/servlet</code>, here are several cases (note that you can here safely substitute <code>&lt;form action&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;img src&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;script src&gt;</code>, etc):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Form action submits to an URL with a leading slash.</p>
  <pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml">  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">form</span> <span class="hljs-attr">action</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"/servlet"</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The leading slash <code>/</code> makes the URL relative to the domain, thus the form will submit to</p>
  <pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>  http://localhost:8080/servlet
</code></pre>
<p>But this will likely result in a 404 as it's in the wrong context.</p>
<hr>
</li>
<li><p>Form action submits to an URL without a leading slash.</p>
  <pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml">  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">form</span> <span class="hljs-attr">action</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"servlet"</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This makes the URL relative to the current folder of the current URL, thus the form will submit to</p>
  <pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>  http://localhost:8080/contextname/jsps/servlet
</code></pre>
<p>But this will likely result in a 404 as it's in the wrong folder.</p>
<hr>
</li>
<li><p>Form action submits to an URL which goes one folder up.</p>
  <pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml">  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">form</span> <span class="hljs-attr">action</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"../servlet"</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This will go one folder up (exactly like as in local disk file system paths!), thus the form will submit to</p>
  <pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>  http://localhost:8080/contextname/servlet
</code></pre>
<p>This one must work!</p>
<hr>
</li>
<li><p>The canonical approach, however, is to make the URL domain-relative so that you don't need to fix the URLs once again when you happen to move the JSP files around into another folder.</p>
  <pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml">  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">form</span> <span class="hljs-attr">action</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"${pageContext.request.contextPath}/servlet"</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This will generate</p>
  <pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml">  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">form</span> <span class="hljs-attr">action</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"/contextname/servlet"</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Which will thus always submit to the right URL.</p>
<hr>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Use straight quotes in HTML attributes</h2>
<p>You need to make absolutely sure you're using straight quotes in HTML attributes like <code>action="..."</code> or <code>action='...'</code> and thus <em>not</em> curly quotes like <code>action=...</code> or <code>action=...</code>. Curly quotes are not supported in HTML and they will simply become part of the value. Watch out when copy-pasting code snippets from blogs! Some blog engines, notably Wordpress, are known to by default use so-called "smart quotes" which thus also corrupts the quotes in code snippets this way. On the other hand, instead of copy-pasting code, try simply typing over the code yourself. Additional advantage of actually getting the code through your brain and fingers is that it will make you to remember and understand the code much better in long term and also make you a better developer.</p>

<h2>Below is further details for Scenario #3:</h2>

<p>SCENARIO 3.1:
   The servlet-class package path is wrong 
   in your web.xml file.</p>

<p>It should MATCH the package statement at top
   of your java servlet class.</p>

<p>File: my_stuff/<strong>MyClass.java</strong>:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">   <span class="hljs-keyword">package</span> my_stuff;

   &lt;/servlet-class&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>SCENARIO 3.2:</p>

<p>You put the wrong "<strong>package</strong>" statement
   at top of your myClass.java file.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>File is in: "<strong>/my_stuff</strong>" folder</p>

<p>You mistakenly write:</p>

<p>This is tricky because:</p>

<p>1: The maven build (mvn package) will not report any errors here.</p>

<p>2: servlet-class line in web.xml can have CORRECT package path. E.g:</p>

<p>Check if you have entered the correct URL Mapping as specified in the Web.xml</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>In the web.xml, your servlet declaration maybe:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">&lt;servlet&gt;
        &lt;servlet-name&gt;ControllerA&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
        &lt;servlet-class&gt;PackageName.ControllerA&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt;

&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
        &lt;servlet-name&gt;ControllerA&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
        &lt;url-pattern&gt;/theController&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>What this snippet does is <code>&lt;url-pattern&gt;/theController&lt;/url-pattern&gt;</code>will set the name that will be used to call the servlet from the front end (eg: form) through the URL. Therefore when you reference the servlet in the front end, in order to ensure that the request goes to the servlet "ControllerA", it should refer the specified URL Pattern "theController" from the form.</p>
<p>eg:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">&lt;form action=<span class="hljs-string">"theController"</span> method=<span class="hljs-string">"POST"</span>&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;

<p>Step 1: <code>Right click on the server(in the server explorer tab)-&gt;Properties-&gt;Switch Location from workspace metadata to tomcat server</code></p>

<p>An old thread, but since I didn't find it elsewhere, here is one more possibility:</p>

<p>If you're using <strong>servlet-api 3.0+</strong>, then your web.xml must <strong>NOT</strong> include <code>metadata-complete="true"</code> attribute</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yqGgjl.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/yqGgjl.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>This tells tomcat to map the servlets using data given in <code>web.xml</code> instead of using the <code>@WebServlet</code> annotation.</p>

<p>First of all, run your IDE as Admin. After that, right click the project folder -&gt; Project Facets and make sure that the Java Version is set correct. On my PC. (For Example 1.8) Now it should work. </p>

<p>Don't just start your server, for example Wildfly, using the cmd. It has to be launched within the IDE and now visit your localhost URL. Example: <a href="http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldServlet/HelloWorld" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://localhost:8080/HelloWorldServlet/HelloWorld</a></p>

<p>The fix that worked for me is(if you are using Maven): Rightclick your project, Maven -&gt; Update project. This might give you some other error with the JDK and other Libraries(in my case, MySQL connector), but once you fix them, your original problem should be fixed!</p>

<p>If you would like to open a servlet with javascript without using 'form' and 'submit' button, here is the following code:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-type">var</span> <span class="hljs-variable">button</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> document.getElementById(<span class="hljs-string">"&lt;&lt;button-id&gt;&gt;"</span>);
button.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">"click"</span>, function() {

});
</code></pre>

<p>Key:</p>

<p>1) button-id : The 'id' tag you give to your button in your html/jsp file.</p>

<p>2) full-servlet-path: The path that shows in the browser when you run the servlet alone</p>

<p>Mapping in web.xml is what i have done :-</p>
<ol>
<li>If there's another package made for new program then we must mention :-</li>
</ol>
<p>packagename.filename between opening and closing of servlet-class tag in xml file.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>If you are mapping your files in xml and they are not working or showing errors , then comment on the annotation line of code in the respective files.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both methods dont work with one another , so either i use annotation method of files mentioned when we create servlet or the way of mapping , then i delete or comment the annotation line. Eg:</p>

   &lt;servlet-name&gt;s1&lt;/servlet-name&gt;

   &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
   &lt;servlet-name&gt;s1&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
   &lt;url-pattern&gt;/FirstServ&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
   &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;

<p>If someone is here who is using MySQL and felt that the code was working the previous day and now it doesn't, then I guess you must open MySQL CLI or MySQL Workbench and just make the connection to the database once. Once it gets connected, then the database also gets connected to the Java Application. I used to get the Hibernate Dialect error stating something wrong with com.mysql.jdbc.Driver.

Or if you don\u0026apos;t have any \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;doGet()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; or if it incorrectly calls \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;super.doGet()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, then a \u0026quot;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5370633/405-http-method-get-is-not-supported-by-this-url\u0026quot;\u0026gt;HTTP 405: HTTP method GET is not supported by this URL\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026quot; error will be shown (which is still better than a 404 as a 405 is evidence that the servlet itself is actually found).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Overriding \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;service()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is a bad practice, unless you\u0026apos;re reinventing a MVC framework  which is very unlikely if you\u0026apos;re just starting out with servlets and are clueless as to the problem described in the current question ;) See also \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3541077/design-patterns-web-based-applications\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Design Patterns web based applications\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Regardless, if the servlet already returns 404 when tested invidivually, then it\u0026apos;s entirely pointless to try with a HTML form instead. Logically, it\u0026apos;s therefore also entirely pointless to include any HTML form in questions about 404 errors from a servlet.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Use domain-relative URL to reference servlet from HTML\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Once you\u0026apos;ve verified that the servlet works fine when invoked individually, then you can advance to HTML. As to your concrete problem with the HTML form, the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;\u0026amp;lt;form action\u0026amp;gt;\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; value needs to be a valid URL. The same applies to \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;\u0026amp;lt;a href\u0026amp;gt;\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;\u0026amp;lt;img src\u0026amp;gt;\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;\u0026amp;lt;script src\u0026amp;gt;\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, etc. You need to understand how absolute/relative URLs work. You know, an URL is a web address as you can enter/see in the webbrowser\u0026apos;s address bar. If you\u0026apos;re specifying a relative URL as form action, i.e. without the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;http://\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; scheme, then it becomes relative to the \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;current\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; URL as you see in your webbrowser\u0026apos;s address bar. It\u0026apos;s thus absolutely not relative to the JSP/HTML file location in server\u0026apos;s WAR folder structure as many starters seem to think.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So, assuming that the JSP page with the HTML form is opened by \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;http://localhost:8080/contextname/jsps/page.jsp\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; (and thus \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;not\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; by \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;file://...\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;), and you need to submit to a servlet located in \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;http://localhost:8080/contextname/servlet\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, here are several cases (note that you can here safely substitute \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;\u0026amp;lt;form action\u0026amp;gt;\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;

Curly quotes are not supported in HTML and they will simply become part of the value. Watch out when copy-pasting code snippets from blogs! Some blog engines, notably Wordpress, are known to by default use so-called \u0026quot;smart quotes\u0026quot; which thus also corrupts the quotes in code snippets this way. On the other hand, instead of copy-pasting code, try simply typing over the code yourself. Additional advantage of actually getting the code through your brain and fingers is that it will make you to remember and understand the code much better in long term and also make you a better developer.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;See also:\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlets/info\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Our servlets wiki page\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;
