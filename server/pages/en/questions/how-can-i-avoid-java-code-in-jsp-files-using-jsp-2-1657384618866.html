What are the alternative JSP 2 lines, and what is this technique called?\n    ","answerCount":30,"upVoteCount":500,"suggestedAnswer":[{"text":"The use of scriptlets (those &lt;% %&gt; things) in JSP is indeed highly discouraged since the birth of taglibs (like JSTL) and EL (Expression Language, those ${} things) way back in 2001.\nThe major disadvantages of scriptlets are:\n\nReusability: you can&apos;t reuse scriptlets.\nReplaceability: you can&apos;t make scriptlets abstract.\nOO-ability: you can&apos;t make use of inheritance/composition.\nDebuggability: if scriptlet throws an exception halfway, all you get is a blank page.\nTestability: scriptlets are not unit-testable.\nMaintainability: per saldo more time is needed to maintain mingled/cluttered/duplicated code logic.\n\nSun Oracle itself also recommends in the JSP coding conventions to avoid use of scriptlets whenever the same functionality is possible by (tag) classes. Here are several cites of relevance:\n\nFrom JSP 1.2 Specification, it is highly recommended that the JSP Standard Tag Library  (JSTL) be used in your web application to help reduce the need for JSP scriptlets in your pages. Pages that use JSTL are, in general, easier to read and maintain.\n...\nWhere possible, avoid JSP scriptlets whenever tag libraries provide equivalent functionality. This makes pages easier to read and maintain, helps to separate business logic from presentation logic, and will make your pages easier to evolve into JSP 2.0-style pages (JSP 2.0 Specification supports but de-emphasizes the use of scriptlets).\n...\nIn the spirit of adopting the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern to reduce coupling between the presentation tier from the business logic, JSP scriptlets should not be used for writing business logic. Rather, JSP scriptlets are used if necessary to transform data (also called &quot;value objects&quot;) returned from processing the client&apos;s requests into a proper client-ready format. Even then, this would be better done with a front controller servlet or a custom tag.\n\n\nHow to replace scriptlets entirely depends on the sole purpose of the code/logic. More than often this code is to be placed in a fullworthy Java class:\n\nIf you want to invoke the same Java code on every request, less-or-more regardless of the requested page, e.g. checking if a user is logged in, then implement a filter and write code accordingly in doFilter() method. E.g.:\n    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws ServletException, IOException {\n      if (((HttpServletRequest) request).getSession().getAttribute(&quot;user&quot;) == null) {\n          ((HttpServletResponse) response).sendRedirect(&quot;login&quot;); // Not logged in, redirect to login page.\n      } else {\n          chain.doFilter(request, response); // Logged in, just continue request.\n      }\n  }\n\nWhen mapped on an appropriate &lt;url-pattern&gt; covering the JSP pages of interest, then you don&apos;t need to copypaste the same piece of code overall JSP pages.\n\n\nIf you want to invoke some Java code to process a GET request, e.g. preloading some list from a database to display in some table, if necessary based on some query parameters, then implement a servlet and write code accordingly in doGet() method. E.g.:\n    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\n      try {\n          List&lt;Product&gt; products = productService.list(); // Obtain all products.\n          request.setAttribute(&quot;products&quot;, products); // Store products in request scope.\n          request.getRequestDispatcher(&quot;/WEB-INF/products.jsp&quot;).forward(request, response); // Forward to JSP page to display them in a HTML table.\n      } catch (SQLException e) {\n          throw new ServletException(&quot;Retrieving products failed!&quot;, e);\n      }\n  }\n\nThis way dealing with exceptions is easier. The DB is not accessed in the midst of JSP rendering, but far before the JSP is been displayed. You still have the possibility to change the response whenever the DB access throws an exception. In the above example, the default error 500 page will be displayed which you can anyway customize by an &lt;error-page&gt; in web.xml.\n\n\nIf you want to invoke some Java code to process a POST request, such as gathering data from a submitted HTML form and doing some business stuff with it (conversion, validation, saving in DB, etcetera), then implement a servlet and write code accordingly in doPost() method. E.g.:\n    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\n      String username = request.getParameter(&quot;username&quot;);\n      String password = request.getParameter(&quot;password&quot;);\n      User user = userService.find(username, password);\n\n      if (user != null) {\n          request.getSession().setAttribute(&quot;user&quot;, user); // Login user.\n          response.sendRedirect(&quot;home&quot;); // Redirect to home page.\n      } else {\n          request.setAttribute(&quot;message&quot;, &quot;Unknown username/password. Please retry.&quot;); // Store error message in request scope.\n          request.getRequestDispatcher(&quot;/WEB-INF/login.jsp&quot;).forward(request, response); // Forward to JSP page to redisplay login form with error.\n      }\n  }\n\nThis way dealing with different result page destinations is easier: redisplaying the form with validation errors in case of an error (in this particular example you can redisplay it using ${message} in EL), or just taking to the desired target page in case of success.\n\n\nIf you want to invoke some Java code to control the execution plan and/or the destination of the request and the response, then implement a servlet according to the MVC&apos;s Front Controller Pattern. E.g.:\n    protected void service(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {\n      try {\n          Action action = ActionFactory.getAction(request);\n          String view = action.execute(request, response);\n\n          if (view.equals(request.getPathInfo().substring(1)) {\n              request.getRequestDispatcher(&quot;/WEB-INF/&quot; + view + &quot;.jsp&quot;).forward(request, response);\n          } else {\n              response.sendRedirect(view);\n          }\n      } catch (Exception e) {\n          throw new ServletException(&quot;Executing action failed.&quot;, e);\n      }\n  }\n\nOr just adopt an MVC framework like JSF, Spring MVC, Wicket, etc so that you end up with just a JSP/Facelets page and a JavaBean class without the need for a custom servlet.\n\n\nIf you want to invoke some Java code to control the flow inside a JSP page, then you need to grab an (existing) flow control taglib like JSTL core. E.g. displaying List&lt;Product&gt; in a table:\n    &lt;%@ taglib uri=&quot;http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core&quot; prefix=&quot;c&quot; %&gt;\n  ...\n  &lt;table&gt;\n      &lt;c:forEach items=&quot;${products}&quot; var=&quot;product&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;tr&gt;\n              &lt;td&gt;${product.name}&lt;/td&gt;\n              &lt;td&gt;${product.description}&lt;/td&gt;\n              &lt;td&gt;${product.price}&lt;/td&gt;\n          &lt;/tr&gt;\n      &lt;/c:forEach&gt;\n  &lt;/table&gt;\n\nWith XML-style tags which fit nicely among all that HTML, the code is better readable (and thus better maintainable) than a bunch of scriptlets with various opening and closing braces (&quot;Where the heck does this closing brace belong to?&quot;). An easy aid is to configure your web application to throw an exception whenever scriptlets are still been used by adding the following piece to web.xml:\n    &lt;jsp-config&gt;\n      &lt;jsp-property-group&gt;\n          &lt;url-pattern&gt;*.jsp&lt;/url-pattern&gt;\n          &lt;scripting-invalid&gt;true&lt;/scripting-invalid&gt;\n      &lt;/jsp-property-group&gt;\n  &lt;/jsp-config&gt;\n\nIn Facelets, the successor of JSP, which is part of the Java EE provided MVC framework JSF, it is already not possible to use scriptlets. This way you&apos;re automatically forced to do things &quot;the right way&quot;.\n\n\nIf you want to invoke some Java code to access and display &quot;backend&quot; data inside a JSP page, then you need to use EL (Expression Language), those ${} things. E.g. redisplaying submitted input values:\n    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;foo&quot; value=&quot;${param.foo}&quot; /&gt;\n\nThe ${param.foo} displays the outcome of request.getParameter(&quot;foo&quot;).\n\n\nIf you want to invoke some utility Java code directly in the JSP page (typically public static methods), then you need to define them as EL functions. There&apos;s a standard functions taglib in JSTL, but you can also easily create functions yourself. Here&apos;s an example how JSTL fn:escapeXml is useful to prevent XSS attacks.\n    &lt;%@ taglib uri=&quot;http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/functions&quot; prefix=&quot;fn&quot; %&gt;\n  ...\n  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;foo&quot; value=&quot;${fn:escapeXml(param.foo)}&quot; /&gt;\n\nNote that the XSS sensitivity is in no way specifically related to Java/JSP/JSTL/EL/whatever, this problem needs to be taken into account in every web application you develop. The problem of scriptlets is that it provides no way of builtin preventions, at least not using the standard Java API. JSP&apos;s successor Facelets has already implicit HTML escaping, so you don&apos;t need to worry about XSS holes in Facelets.\n\n\nSee also:\n\nWhat&apos;s the difference between JSP, Servlet and JSF?\nHow does Servlet, ServletContext, HttpSession and HttpServletRequest/Response work?\nBasic MVC example with JSP, Servlet and JDBC\nDesign patterns in Java web applications\nHidden features of JSP/Servlet\n\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/how-can-i-avoid-java-code-in-jsp-files-using-jsp-2-1657384618866#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"As a Safeguard: Disable Scriptlets For Good\n\nAs another question is discussing, you can and always should disable scriptlets in your web.xml web application descriptor.\n\nI would always do that in order to prevent any developer adding scriptlets, especially in bigger companies where you will lose overview sooner or later.

Also, the tag &lt;jsp:doBody/&gt; will be replaced by the content of the child page \n\nCreate child page (child.jsp) in your WebContent folder:\n\n\n  \n\n&lt;%@ taglib prefix=&quot;t&quot; tagdir=&quot;/WEB-INF/tags&quot; %&gt;\n\n&lt;t:base&gt;\n    &lt;jsp:attribute name=&quot;title&quot;&gt; \n        &lt;bean:message key=&quot;hello.world&quot; /&gt;\n    &lt;/jsp:attribute&gt;\n\n    &lt;jsp:body&gt;\n    [Put your content of the child here]\n    &lt;/jsp:body&gt;   \n&lt;/t:base&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;t:base&gt; is used to specify the master page you want to use (which is base.tag at this moment). All the content inside the tag &lt;jsp:body&gt; here will replace the &lt;jsp:doBody/&gt; on your master page. Your child page can also include any tag lib and you can use it normally like the other mentioned. However, if you use any scriptlet code here (&lt;%= request.getParameter(&quot;name&quot;) %&gt; ...) and try to run this page, you will get a JasperException because  Scripting elements ( &amp;lt;%!, &amp;lt;jsp:declaration, &amp;lt;%=, &amp;lt;jsp:expression, &amp;lt;%, &amp;lt;jsp:scriptlet ) are disallowed here. Therefore, there is no way other people can include the evil code into the jsp file\n\nCalling this page from your controller:\n\nYou can easily call the child.jsp file from your controller. This also works nice with the struts framework\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/how-can-i-avoid-java-code-in-jsp-files-using-jsp-2-1657384618866#solution13","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Use JSTL tag libraries in JSP.

There&apos;s zero wrong with that. However I don&apos;t think it really answers your question, because frameworks may or may not use JSPs, nor are they designed in any way with removing java use in JSPs as a primary goal. \nThe only good answer to your question &quot;how do I avoid using Java in a JSP&quot; is: you can&apos;t.  That&apos;s what JSPs are for - using Java to render HTML with dynamic data/logic.\nThe follow up question might be, how much java should I use in my JSPs. Before we answer that question, you should also ponder, &quot;do I need to use JSPs to build web content using Java?&quot; The answer to that last one is, no. There are many alternatives to JSPs for developing web facing applications using Java. Struts for example does not force you to use JSPs - don&apos;t get me wrong, you can use them and many implementations do, but you don&apos;t absolutely have to. Struts doesn&apos;t even force you to use any HTML. A JSP doesn&apos;t either, but let&apos;s be honest, a JSP producing no HTML is kinda weird. Servlets, famously, allow you to serve any kind of content you like over HTTP dynamically. They are the primary tech behind pretty much everything java web - JSPs are just HTML templates for servlets, really. \nSo the answer to how much java you should put in a JSP is, &quot;as little as possible&quot;. I of course have java in my JSPs, but it consists exclusively of tag library definitions, session and client variables, and beans encapsulating server side objects. The &lt;%%&gt; tags in my HTML are almost exclusively property calls or variable expressions. Rare exceptions include ultra-specific calculations pertaining to a single page and unlikely to ever be reused; bugfixes stemming from page-specific issues only applying to one page; last minute concatenations and arithmetic stemming from unusual requirements limited in scope to a single page; and other similar cases. In a code set of 1.5 million lines, 3000 JSPs and 5000 classes, there are maybe 100 instances of such unique snippets. It would have been quite possible to make these changes in classes or tag library definitions, but it would have been inordinately complex due to the specificity of each case, taken longer to write and debug, and taken more time as a result to get to my users. It&apos;s a judgement call. But make no mistake, you cannot write JSPs of any meaning with &quot;no java&quot; nor would you want to.

<p>The use of <em>scriptlets</em> (those <code>&lt;% %&gt;</code> things) in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/jsp/info">JSP</a> is indeed highly discouraged since the birth of <em>taglibs</em> (like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/jstl/info">JSTL</a>) and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/el/info">EL</a> (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/el/info">Expression Language</a>, those <code>${}</code> things) way back in 2001.</p>
<p>The major disadvantages of <em>scriptlets</em> are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reusability:</strong> you can't reuse scriptlets.</li>
<li><strong>Replaceability:</strong> you can't make scriptlets abstract.</li>
<li><strong>OO-ability:</strong> you can't make use of inheritance/composition.</li>
<li><strong>Debuggability:</strong> if scriptlet throws an exception halfway, all you get is a blank page.</li>
<li><strong>Testability:</strong> scriptlets are not unit-testable.</li>
<li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> per saldo more time is needed to maintain mingled/cluttered/duplicated code logic.</li>
</ol>
<p><strike>Sun</strike> Oracle itself also recommends in the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/javase/code-convention.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JSP coding conventions</a> to avoid use of <em>scriptlets</em> whenever the same functionality is possible by (tag) classes. Here are several cites of relevance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From JSP 1.2 Specification, it is highly recommended that the JSP Standard Tag Library  (JSTL) be used in your web application to help <strong>reduce the need for JSP scriptlets</strong> in your pages. Pages that use JSTL are, in general, easier to read and maintain.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Where possible, <strong>avoid JSP scriptlets</strong> whenever tag libraries provide equivalent functionality. This makes pages easier to read and maintain, helps to separate business logic from presentation logic, and will make your pages easier to evolve into JSP 2.0-style pages (JSP 2.0 Specification supports but de-emphasizes the use of scriptlets).</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In the spirit of adopting the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern to reduce coupling between the presentation tier from the business logic, <strong>JSP scriptlets should not be used</strong> for writing business logic. Rather, JSP scriptlets are used if necessary to transform data (also called "value objects") returned from processing the client's requests into a proper client-ready format. Even then, this would be better done with a front controller servlet or a custom tag.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p><strong>How to replace <em>scriptlets</em> entirely depends on the sole purpose of the code/logic. More than often this code is to be placed in a fullworthy Java class:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you want to invoke the <strong>same</strong> Java code on <em>every</em> request, less-or-more regardless of the requested page, e.g. checking if a user is logged in, then implement a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlet-filters/info">filter</a> and write code accordingly in <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/9/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/filter#doFilter-jakarta.servlet.ServletRequest-jakarta.servlet.ServletResponse-jakarta.servlet.FilterChain-" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>doFilter()</code></a> method. E.g.:</p>
  <pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">  <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">doFilter</span><span class="hljs-params">(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">throws</span> ServletException, IOException {

      }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>When mapped on an appropriate <code>&lt;url-pattern&gt;</code> covering the JSP pages of interest, then you don't need to copypaste the same piece of code overall JSP pages.</p>
<hr>
</li>
<li><p>If you want to invoke some Java code to <strong>process a GET request</strong>, e.g. preloading some list from a database to display in some table, if necessary based on some query parameters, then implement a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlets/info">servlet</a> and write code accordingly in <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/9/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/httpservlet#doGet-jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest-jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse-" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>doGet()</code></a> method.

<p>This way dealing with exceptions is easier. The DB is not accessed in the midst of JSP rendering, but far before the JSP is been displayed. You still have the possibility to change the response whenever the DB access throws an exception. In the above example, the default error 500 page will be displayed which you can anyway customize by an <code>&lt;error-page&gt;</code> in <code>web.xml</code>.</p>

<li><p>If you want to invoke some Java code to <strong>process a POST request</strong>, such as gathering data from a submitted HTML form and doing some business stuff with it (conversion, validation, saving in DB, etcetera), then implement a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/servlets/info">servlet</a> and write code accordingly in <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/platform/9/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/httpservlet#doPost-jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest-jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse-" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>doPost()</code></a> method.

<p>This way dealing with different result page destinations is easier: redisplaying the form with validation errors in case of an error (in this particular example you can redisplay it using <code>${message}</code> in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/el/info">EL</a>), or just taking to the desired target page in case of success.</p>

<p>Or just adopt an MVC framework like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/jsf/info">JSF</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-mvc/info">Spring MVC</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/wicket/info">Wicket</a>, etc so that you end up with just a JSP/Facelets page and a JavaBean class without the need for a custom servlet.</p>

<li><p>If you want to invoke some Java code to <strong>control the flow</strong> inside a JSP page, then you need to grab an (existing) flow control taglib like <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/tags/1.2/tagdocs/c/tld-summary.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">JSTL core</a>.

<p>With XML-style tags which fit nicely among all that HTML, the code is better readable (and thus better maintainable) than a bunch of scriptlets with various opening and closing braces (<em>"Where the heck does this closing brace belong to?"</em>). An easy aid is to configure your web application to throw an exception whenever <em>scriptlets</em> are still been used by adding the following piece to <code>web.xml</code>:</p>
  <pre class="lang-xml s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml">  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">jsp-config</span>&gt;</span>
      <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">jsp-property-group</span>&gt;</span>
          <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">url-pattern</span>&gt;</span>*.jsp<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">url-pattern</span>&gt;</span>
          <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">scripting-invalid</span>&gt;</span>true<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">scripting-invalid</span>&gt;</span>
      <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">jsp-property-group</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">jsp-config</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/facelets/info">Facelets</a>, the successor of JSP, which is part of the Java EE provided MVC framework <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/tags/jsf/info">JSF</a>, it is already <strong>not</strong> possible to use <em>scriptlets</em>. This way you're automatically forced to do things "the right way".</p>
<hr>
</li>
<li><p>If you want to invoke some Java code to <strong>access and display</strong> "backend" data inside a JSP page, then you need to use EL (Expression Language), those <code>${}</code> things. E.g. redisplaying submitted input values:</p>
  <pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml">  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">input</span> <span class="hljs-attr">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"text"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">value</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"${param.foo}"</span> /&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>${param.foo}</code> displays the outcome of <code>request.getParameter("foo")</code>.</p>
<hr>
</li>
<li><p>If you want to invoke some <strong>utility</strong> Java code directly in the JSP page (typically <code>public static</code> methods), then you need to define them as EL functions. There's a standard <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/tags/1.2/tagdocs/fn/tld-summary.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">functions taglib</a> in JSTL, but <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6395621/how-to-call-a-static-method-in-jsp-el">you can also easily create functions yourself</a>. Here's an example how JSTL <code>fn:escapeXml</code> is useful to prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting" rel="nofollow noreferrer">XSS attacks</a>.</p>
  <pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml">  &lt;%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/functions" prefix="fn" %&gt;
  ...
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">input</span> <span class="hljs-attr">type</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"text"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">value</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"${fn:escapeXml(param.foo)}"</span> /&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the XSS sensitivity is in no way specifically related to Java/JSP/JSTL/EL/whatever, this problem needs to be taken into account in <strong>every</strong> web application you develop. The problem of <em>scriptlets</em> is that it provides no way of builtin preventions, at least not using the standard Java API. JSP's successor Facelets has already implicit HTML escaping, so you don't need to worry about XSS holes in Facelets.</p>

<p><strong>As a Safeguard: Disable Scriptlets For Good</strong></p>

<p>As <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2188706/how-to-avoid-using-scriptlets-in-my-jsp-page">another question</a> is discussing, you can and always should disable scriptlets in your <code>web.xml</code> web application descriptor.</p>

<p>I would always do that in order to prevent any developer adding scriptlets, especially in bigger companies where you will lose overview sooner or later. The <code>web.xml</code> settings look like this:</p>

<p>There are also component-based frameworks, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Wicket" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Wicket</a>, that generate a lot of the HTML for you.</p>
<p>The tags that end up in the HTML are extremely basic and there is virtually no logic that gets mixed in. The result is almost empty-like HTML pages with typical HTML elements.

<p>Experience has shown that JSP's have some shortcomings, one of them being hard to avoid mixing markup with actual code.</p>

<p>If you can, then consider using a specialized technology for what you need to do.  In Java EE 6 there is JSF 2.0, which provides a lot of nice features including gluing Java beans together with JSF pages through the <code>#{bean.method(argument)}</code> approach.</p>

<p>You raised a good question and although you got good answers, I would suggest that you get rid of JSP. It is outdated technology which eventually will die. Use a modern approach, like template engines. You will have very clear separation of business and presentation layers, and certainly no Java code in templates, so you can generate templates directly from web presentation editing software, in most cases leveraging WYSIWYG.</p>

<p>And certainly stay away of filters and pre and post processing, otherwise you may deal with support/debugging difficulties since you always do not know where the variable gets the value.</p>

<p>No matter how much you try to avoid, when you work with other developers, some of them will still prefer scriptlet and then insert the evil code into the project. Therefore, setting up the project at the first sign is very important if you really want to reduce the scriptlet code. There are several techniques to get over this (including several frameworks that other mentioned). However, if you prefer the pure JSP way, then use the JSTL tag file. The nice thing about this is you can also set up master pages for your project, so the other pages can inherit the master pages</p>

<p><strong>Create a master page called base.tag under your WEB-INF/tags with the following content</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">&lt;%<span class="hljs-meta">@tag</span> description=<span class="hljs-string">"Overall Page template"</span> pageEncoding=<span class="hljs-string">"UTF-8"</span>%&gt;

&lt;%<span class="hljs-meta">@attribute</span> name=<span class="hljs-string">"title"</span> fragment=<span class="hljs-string">"true"</span> %&gt;

&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;  
       &lt;jsp:invoke fragment=<span class="hljs-string">"title"</span>&gt;&lt;/jsp:invoke&gt;
    &lt;/title&gt;

  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id=<span class="hljs-string">"page-header"</span>&gt;
       ....
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=<span class="hljs-string">"page-body"</span>&gt;
      &lt;jsp:doBody/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=<span class="hljs-string">"page-footer"</span>&gt;
      .....
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>On this mater page, I created a fragment called "title", so that in the child page, I could insert more codes into this place of the master page. Also, the tag <code>&lt;jsp:doBody/&gt;</code> will be replaced by the content of the child page </p>

<p><strong>Create child page (child.jsp) in your WebContent folder:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">&lt;%@ taglib prefix=<span class="hljs-string">"t"</span> tagdir=<span class="hljs-string">"/WEB-INF/tags"</span> %&gt;

&lt;t:base&gt;
    &lt;jsp:attribute name=<span class="hljs-string">"title"</span>&gt; 
        &lt;bean:message key=<span class="hljs-string">"hello.world"</span> /&gt;
    &lt;/jsp:attribute&gt;

    &lt;jsp:body&gt;
    [Put your content of the child here]
    &lt;/jsp:body&gt;   
&lt;/t:base&gt;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p><code>&lt;t:base&gt;</code> is used to specify the master page you want to use (which is base.tag at this moment). All the content inside the tag <code>&lt;jsp:body&gt;</code> here will replace the <code>&lt;jsp:doBody/&gt;</code> on your master page. Your child page can also include any tag lib and you can use it normally like the other mentioned. However, if you use any scriptlet code here (<code>&lt;%= request.getParameter("name") %&gt;</code> ...) and try to run this page, you will get a <code>JasperException because  Scripting elements ( &amp;lt;%!, &amp;lt;jsp:declaration, &amp;lt;%=, &amp;lt;jsp:expression, &amp;lt;%, &amp;lt;jsp:scriptlet ) are disallowed here</code>. Therefore, there is no way other people can include the evil code into the jsp file</p>

<p><strong>Calling this page from your controller:</strong></p>

<p>You can easily call the child.jsp file from your controller. This also works nice with the struts framework</p>

<p><strong>If somebody is really against programming in more languages than one</strong>, I suggest GWT. Theoretically, you can avoid all the JavaScript and HTML elements, because Google Toolkit transforms all the client and shared code to JavaScript. You won't have problem with them, so you have a webservice without coding in any other languages. You can even use some default CSS from somewhere as it is given by extensions (smartGWT or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaadin" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Vaadin</a>). You don't need to learn dozens of annotations.</p>
<p>Of course, if you want, you can hack yourself into the depths of the code and inject JavaScript and enrich your HTML page, but really you can avoid it if you want, and the result will be good as it was written in any other frameworks. I it's say worth a try, and the basic GWT is well-documented.</p>
<p>And of course many fellow programmers hereby described or recommended several other solutions. GWT is for people who really don't want to deal with the web part or to minimize it.</p>

<p>Sure, replace <code>&lt;%! counter++; %&gt;</code> by an event producer-consumer architecture, where the business layer is notified about the need to increment the counter, it reacts accordingly, and notifies the presenters so that they update the views. A number of database transactions are involved, since in future we will need to know the new and old value of the counter, who has incremented it and with what purpose in mind. Obviously serialization is involved, since the layers are entirely decoupled. You will be able to increment your counter over RMI, IIOP, SOAP. But only HTML is required, which you don't implement, since it is such a mundane case. Your new goal is to reach 250 increments a second on your new shiny E7, 64GB RAM server.</p>

<p>I have more than 20 years in programming, most of the projects fail before the sextet: Reusability Replaceability OO-ability Debuggability Testability Maintainability is even needed.

<p><em><strong>How can I avoid Java code in JSP files?</strong></em></p>
<p>You can use tab library tags like <strong>JSTL</strong> in addition to Expression Language (<strong>EL</strong>). But EL does not work well with JSP. So it's is probably better to drop JSP completely and use <strong>Facelets</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Facelets</strong> is the first non JSP page declaration language designed for <strong>JSF (Java Server Faces)</strong> which provided a simpler and more powerful programming model to JSF developers as compare to JSP. It resolves different issues occurs in JSP for web applications development.</p>

<p>Using Scriptlets is a very old way and <em>not</em> recommended. If you want directly output something in your JSP pages, just use <strong>Expression Language (EL)</strong>  along with <strong>JSTL</strong>.</p>

<p>Also, take note that it is not a best practice to do business logic in the view layer. You should perform your business logic in the <em>service</em> layer,

<p>Nothing of that is used anymore, my friend. My advice is to decouple the view (CSS, HTML, JavaScript, etc.) from the server.</p>

<p>JSP 2.0 has a feature called <strong>"Tag Files"</strong>, and you can write tags without external Java code and <code>tld</code>. You need to create a <code>.tag</code> file and put it in <code>WEB-INF\tags</code>. You can even create a directory structure to package your tags.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">/WEB-INF/tags/html/label.tag

&lt;%<span class="hljs-meta">@tag</span> description=<span class="hljs-string">"Rensders a label with required css class"</span> pageEncoding=<span class="hljs-string">"UTF-8"</span>%&gt;
&lt;%<span class="hljs-meta">@attribute</span> name=<span class="hljs-string">"name"</span> required=<span class="hljs-string">"true"</span> description=<span class="hljs-string">"The label"</span>%&gt;

&lt;label class=<span class="hljs-string">"control-label control-default"</span>  id=<span class="hljs-string">"${name}Label"</span>&gt;${name}&lt;/label&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Use it like</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">&lt;%@ taglib prefix=<span class="hljs-string">"h"</span> tagdir=<span class="hljs-string">"/WEB-INF/tags/html"</span>%&gt;
&lt;h:label  name=<span class="hljs-string">"customer name"</span> /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Also, you can read the tag body easily:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">/WEB-INF/tags/html/bold.tag
&lt;%<span class="hljs-meta">@tag</span> description=<span class="hljs-string">"Bold tag"</span> pageEncoding=<span class="hljs-string">"UTF-8"</span>%&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
  &lt;jsp:doBody/&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Use it:</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">&lt;%@ taglib prefix=<span class="hljs-string">"h"</span> tagdir=<span class="hljs-string">"/WEB-INF/tags/bold"</span>%&gt;
&lt;h:bold&gt;Make me bold&lt;/h:bold&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The samples are very simple, but you can do lots of complicated tasks here. Please consider you can use other tags (for example: <code>JSTL</code> which has controlling tags like <code>if/forEcah/chosen</code> text manipulation like <code>format/contains/uppercase</code> or even SQL tags <code>select/update</code>), pass all kind parameters, for example <code>Hashmap</code>, access <code>session</code>, <code>request</code>, ... in your tag file too.</p>
<p><strong>Tag File</strong> are so easy developed as you did not need to restart the server when changing them, like JSP files. This makes them easy for development.</p>
<p>Even if you use a framework like Struts 2, which have lots of good tags, you may find that having your own tags can reduce your code a lot. You can pass your tag parameters to struts and this way customize your framework tag.</p>
<p>You can use tags not only to avoid Java, but also minimize your HTML codes. I myself try to review HTML code and build tags a lot as soon as I see code duplicates start in my pages.</p>
<p>(Even if you end up using Java in your JSP code, which I hope not, you can encapsulate that code in a tag.)</p>

<p>A lot of the answers here go the "use a framework" route. There's zero wrong with that. However I don't think it really answers your question, because frameworks may or may not use JSPs, nor are they designed in any way with removing java use in JSPs as a primary goal. <br><br>
The only good answer to your question "how do I avoid using Java in a JSP" is: you can't. <br> <br>That's what JSPs are for - using Java to render HTML with dynamic data/logic.
The follow up question might be, how much java should I use in my JSPs.<br> Before we answer that question, you should also ponder, "do I need to use JSPs to build web content using Java?" The answer to that last one is, no. There are many alternatives to JSPs for developing web facing applications using Java. Struts for example does not force you to use JSPs - don't get me wrong, you can use them and many implementations do, but you don't absolutely have to. Struts doesn't even force you to use any HTML. A JSP doesn't either, but let's be honest, a JSP producing no HTML is kinda weird. Servlets, famously, allow you to serve any kind of content you like over HTTP dynamically. They are <em>the</em> primary tech behind pretty much everything java web - JSPs are just HTML templates for servlets, really. <br>
So the answer to how much java you should put in a JSP is, "as little as possible". I of course have java in my JSPs, but it consists exclusively of tag library definitions, session and client variables, and beans encapsulating server side objects. The &lt;%%&gt; tags in my HTML are almost exclusively property calls or variable expressions. Rare exceptions include ultra-specific calculations pertaining to a single page and unlikely to ever be reused; bugfixes stemming from page-specific issues only applying to one page; last minute concatenations and arithmetic stemming from unusual requirements limited in scope to a single page; and other similar cases. In a code set of 1.5 million lines, 3000 JSPs and 5000 classes, there are maybe 100 instances of such unique snippets. It would have been quite possible to make these changes in classes or tag library definitions, but it would have been inordinately complex due to the specificity of each case, taken longer to write and debug, and taken more time as a result to get to my users. It's a judgement call. But make no mistake, you cannot write JSPs of any meaning with "no java" nor would you want to. The capability is there for a reason.</p>

<p>Java itself is a very nice language, but heavy usage in the enterprise environment made its standard solutions extremely (ridiculously) difficult. Examples: JSTL, JSF, Wicket, etc.</p>
<p>Here is a super lightweight approach to creating a backend in Java:</p>
<ul>
<li>don't use JSP (or any other template engine) at all;</li>
<li>use plain HTML templates;</li>
<li>use JSOUP to parse HTML templates into Document object;</li>
<li>modify Document object using its very intuitive jQuery like methods;</li>
<li>return Document.toString() as response to request.</li>
</ul>
<p>I use it for one of my side projects (hosted Digitalocean $5 droplet, Nginx, Tomcat) and it is very fast: according to Googlebot average response time is about 160 ms.</p>

You will have very clear separation of business and presentation layers, and certainly no Java code in templates, so you can generate templates directly from web presentation editing software, in most cases leveraging WYSIWYG.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;And certainly stay away of filters and pre and post processing, otherwise you may deal with support/debugging difficulties since you always do not know where the variable gets the value.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In order to avoid Java code in JSP files, Java now provides tag libraries, like JSTL.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Also, Java has come up with \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Faces\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;nofollow noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;JSF\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; into which you can write all programming structures in the form of tags.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;No matter how much you try to avoid, when you work with other developers, some of them will still prefer scriptlet and then insert the evil code into the project.

There are several techniques to get over this (including several frameworks that other mentioned). However, if you prefer the pure JSP way, then use the JSTL tag file.

Obviously serialization is involved, since the layers are entirely decoupled. You will be able to increment your counter over RMI, IIOP, SOAP.

There\u0026apos;s zero wrong with that. However I don\u0026apos;t think it really answers your question, because frameworks may or may not use JSPs, nor are they designed in any way with removing java use in JSPs as a primary goal. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nThe only good answer to your question \u0026quot;how do I avoid using Java in a JSP\u0026quot; is: you can\u0026apos;t. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt; \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;That\u0026apos;s what JSPs are for - using Java to render HTML with dynamic data/logic.\nThe follow up question might be, how much java should I use in my JSPs.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt; Before we answer that question, you should also ponder, \u0026quot;do I need to use JSPs to build web content using Java?\u0026quot; The answer to that last one is, no. There are many alternatives to JSPs for developing web facing applications using Java. Struts for example does not force you to use JSPs - don\u0026apos;t get me wrong, you can use them and many implementations do, but you don\u0026apos;t absolutely have to. Struts doesn\u0026apos;t even force you to use any HTML. A JSP doesn\u0026apos;t either, but let\u0026apos;s be honest, a JSP producing no HTML is kinda weird. Servlets, famously, allow you to serve any kind of content you like over HTTP dynamically. They are \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;the\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; primary tech behind pretty much everything java web - JSPs are just HTML templates for servlets, really. \u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nSo the answer to how much java you should put in a JSP is, \u0026quot;as little as possible\u0026quot;. I of course have java in my JSPs, but it consists exclusively of tag library definitions, session and client variables, and beans encapsulating server side objects. The \u0026amp;lt;%%\u0026amp;gt; tags in my HTML are almost exclusively property calls or variable expressions. Rare exceptions include ultra-specific calculations pertaining to a single page and unlikely to ever be reused; bugfixes stemming from page-specific issues only applying to one page; last minute concatenations and arithmetic stemming from unusual requirements limited in scope to a single page; and other similar cases. In a code set of 1.5 million lines, 3000 JSPs and 5000 classes, there are maybe 100 instances of such unique snippets. It would have been quite possible to make these changes in classes or tag library definitions, but it would have been inordinately complex due to the specificity of each case, taken longer to write and debug, and taken more time as a result to get to my users. It\u0026apos;s a judgement call. But make no mistake, you cannot write JSPs of any meaning with \u0026quot;no java\u0026quot; nor would you want to. The capability is there for a reason.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Java itself is a very nice language, but heavy usage in the enterprise environment made its standard solutions extremely (ridiculously) difficult.
