As you may have imagined, you&apos;ll have to use JavaScript to add that &quot;on&quot; class to the element, but at least you&apos;re still using CSS for the actual transition.\n\nP.S. If you find yourself in a situation where you need to do both display:block, and add class &quot;on&quot;, at the same time, defer the latter using setTimeout. Otherwise, the browser just sees both things as happening at once and disables the transition.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution22","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You can get this to work the natural way you expected - using display - but you have to throttle the browser to get it to work, using either Javascript or as others have suggested a fancy trick with one tag inside another. I don&apos;t care for the inner tag as it further complicates CSS and dimensions, so here&apos;s the Javascript solution:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/hweyecu4/17/\nStarting with a box like:\n&lt;div id=&quot;box&quot; class=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;Lorem&lt;/div&gt;\n\nA hidden box.\ndiv.hidden {\n    display: none;\n}\n#box {\n    transition: opacity 1s;\n}\n    \n\nWe&apos;re going to use a trick found in a related q/a, checking offsetHeight to throttle the browser instantaneously:\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/16575811/176877\nFirst, a library formalizing the above trick:\n$.fn.noTrnsn = function () {\n    return this.each(function (i, tag) {\n        tag.style.transition = &apos;none&apos;;\n    });\n};\n$.fn.resumeTrnsn = function () {\n    return this.each(function (i, tag) {\n        tag.offsetHeight;    \n        tag.style.transition = null;\n    });\n};\n\nNext, we&apos;re going to use it to reveal a box, and fade it in:\n$(&apos;#button&apos;).on(&apos;click&apos;, function() {\n    var tag = $(&apos;#box&apos;);\n    if (tag.hasClass(&apos;hidden&apos;))\n        tag.noTrnsn().removeClass(&apos;hidden&apos;)\n        .css({ opacity: 0 })\n        .resumeTrnsn().css({ opacity: 1 });\n    else\n        tag.css({ opacity: 0 });\n});\n\nThis fades the box in and out. So, .noTrnsn() turns off transitions, then we remove the hidden class, which flips display from none to its default, block. We then set opacity to 0 to get ready for fading in. Now that we&apos;ve set the stage, we turn transitions back on, with .resumeTrnsn(). And finally, kick off the transition by setting opacity to 1.\nWithout the library, both the change to display and the change to opacity would&apos;ve gotten us undesirable results. If we simply removed the library calls, we&apos;d get no transitions at all.\nNote that the above does not set display to none again at the end of the fadeout animation. We can get fancier though. Let&apos;s do so with one that fades in and grows in height from 0.\nFancy!\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/hweyecu4/22/\n#box {\n    transition: height 1s, opacity 1s;\n}\n\nWe&apos;re now transitioning both height and opacity. Note that we are not setting height, which means it is the default, auto. Conventionally this cannot be transitioned - moving from auto to a pixel value (like 0) will get you no transition. We&apos;re going to work around that with the library, and one more library method:\n$.fn.wait = function (time, fn) {\n    if (time)\n        this.delay(time);\n    if (!fn)\n        return this;\n\n    var _this = this;\n    return this.queue(function (n) {\n        fn.call(_this);\n        n();\n    });\n};\n\nThis is a convenience method that lets us participate in jQuery&apos;s existing fx/animation queue, without requiring any of the animation framework that&apos;s now excluded in jQuery 3.x. I&apos;m not going to explain how jQuery works, but suffice to say, the .queue() and .stop() plumbing that jQuery provides help us prevent our animations from stepping on each other.\nLet&apos;s animate the slide down effect.\n$(&apos;#button&apos;).on(&apos;click&apos;, function() {\n    var tag = $(&apos;#box&apos;);\n    if (tag.hasClass(&apos;hidden&apos;)) {\n        // Open it\n        // Measure it\n        tag.stop().noTrnsn().removeClass(&apos;hidden&apos;).css({\n            opacity: 0, height: &apos;auto&apos;\n        });\n        var h = tag.height();\n        tag.css({ height: 0 }).resumeTrnsn()\n        // Animate it\n        .css({ opacity: 1, height: h })\n        .wait(1000, function() {\n            tag.css({ height: &apos;auto&apos; });\n        });\n    } else {\n        // Close it\n        // Measure it\n        var h = tag.noTrnsn().height();\n        tag.stop().css({ height: h })\n        .resumeTrnsn()\n        // Animate it\n        .css({ opacity: 0, height: 0 })\n        .wait(1000, function() {\n            tag.addClass(&apos;hidden&apos;);\n        });\n    }\n});\n\nThis code begins by checking on #box and whether it&apos;s currently hidden, by checking on its class. But it accomplishes more using the wait() library call, by adding the hidden class at the end of the slideout/fade animation, which you&apos;d expect to find if it is in fact hidden - something the above simpler example could not do. This happens to also enable display/hiding the element over and over, which was a bug in the previous example, because the hidden class was never restored.\nYou can also see CSS and class changes being called after .noTrnsn() to generally set the stage for animations, including taking measurements, like measuring what will be the final height of #box without showing that to the user, before calling .resumeTrnsn(), and animating it from that fully-set stage to its goal CSS values.\nOld Answer\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/hweyecu4/1/\nYou can have it transition on click with:\nfunction toggleTransition() {\n  var el = $(&quot;div.box1&quot;);\n\n  if (el.length) {\n    el[0].className = &quot;box&quot;;\n    el.stop().css({maxWidth: 10000}).animate({maxWidth: 10001}, 2000, function() {\n        el[0].className = &quot;box hidden&quot;;\n    });\n  } else {\n    el = $(&quot;div.box&quot;);\n    el[0].className = &quot;box&quot;;\n    el.stop().css({maxWidth: 10001}).animate({maxWidth: 10000}, 50, function() {\n        el[0].className = &quot;box box1&quot;;\n    });\n  }\n\n  return el;\n}\n\nsomeTag.click(toggleTransition);\n\nThe CSS is what you&apos;d guess:\n.hidden {\n    display: none;\n}\n.box {\n    width: 100px;\n    height: 100px;\n    background-color: blue;\n    color: yellow;\n    font-size: 18px;\n    left: 20px;\n    top: 20px;\n    position: absolute;\n    -webkit-transform-origin: 0 50%;\n    transform-origin: 0 50%;\n    -webkit-transform: scale(.2);\n    transform: scale(.2);\n    -webkit-transition: transform 2s;\n    transition: transform 2s;\n}\n.box1{\n    -webkit-transform: scale(1);\n    transform: scale(1);\n}\n\nThe key is throttling the display property. By removing the hidden class and then waiting 50 ms, then starting the transition via the added class, we get it to appear and then expand like we wanted, instead of it just blipping onto the screen without any animation. Similar occurs going the other way, except we wait till the animation is over before applying hidden.\nNote: I&apos;m abusing .animate(maxWidth) here to avoid setTimeout race conditions. setTimeout is quick to introduce hidden bugs when you or someone else picks up code unaware of it. .animate() can easily be killed with .stop(). I&apos;m just using it to put a 50 ms or 2000 ms delay on the standard fx queue where it&apos;s easy to find/resolve by other coders building on top of this.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution23","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Well another way to apply transition in this situation without using keyframes is to set the width of your element to zero and then unset it on hover\n.className{\n  visibility:hidden;\n  opacity: 0;\n  transition: .2s;\n  width:0;\n}\n\n.className:hover{\n  visibility:visible;\n  margin-right: .5rem;\n  opacity: 1;\n  width:unset;\n}\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution24","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I had a similar issue that I couldn&apos;t find the answer to.

<p>I'm currently designing a CSS 'mega dropdown' menu - basically a regular CSS-only dropdown menu, but one that contains different types of content.</p>

<p>At the moment, <strong>it appears that CSS&nbsp;3 transitions don't apply to the 'display' property</strong>, i.e., you can't do any sort of transition from <code>display: none</code> to <code>display: block</code> (or any combination).</p>

<p>Is there a way for the second-tier menu from the above example to 'fade in' when someone hovers over one of the top level menu items?</p>

<p>I'm aware that you can use transitions on the <code>visibility:</code> property, but I can't think of a way to use that effectively.</p>

<p>I've also tried using height, but that just failed miserably.</p>

<p>I'm also aware that it's trivial to achieve this using JavaScript, but I wanted to challenge myself to use just CSS, and I think I'm coming up a little short.</p>

<p>You need to hide the element by other means in order to get this to work.</p>

<p>I accomplished the effect by positioning both <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s absolutely and setting the hidden one to <code>opacity: 0</code>.</p>

<p><strong>If you even toggle the <code>display</code> property from <code>none</code> to <code>block</code>, your transition on other elements will not occur.</strong></p>

<p>To work around this, always allow the element to be <code>display: block</code>, but hide the element by adjusting any of these means:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set the <code>height</code> to <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>Set the <code>opacity</code> to <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>Position the element outside of the frame of another element that has <code>overflow: hidden</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are likely more solutions, but you cannot perform a transition if you toggle the element to <code>display: none</code>. For example, you may attempt to try something like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-css s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">div</span> {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">display</span>: none;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">transition</span>: opacity <span class="hljs-number">1s</span> ease-out;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">opacity</span>: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
}
<span class="hljs-selector-tag">div</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.active</span> {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">opacity</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">display</span>: block;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But that will <strong>not</strong> work. From my experience, I have found this to do nothing.</p>

<p>Because of this, you will always need to keep the element <code>display: block</code> - but you could get around it by doing something like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-css s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">div</span> {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">transition</span>: opacity <span class="hljs-number">1s</span> ease-out;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">opacity</span>: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">height</span>: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">overflow</span>: hidden;
}
<span class="hljs-selector-tag">div</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.active</span> {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">opacity</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;

<p>At the time of this post all major browsers disable CSS transitions if you try to change the <code>display</code> property, but CSS animations still work fine so we can use them as a workaround.</p>

<p><strong>Example Code</strong> (you can apply it to your menu accordingly) <a href="http://cssdesk.com/7WPCT" rel="noreferrer">Demo</a>:</p>

<p>Add the following CSS to your stylesheet:</p>

<pre class="lang-css s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-keyword">@-webkit-keyframes</span> fadeIn {
    <span class="hljs-selector-tag">from</span> { <span class="hljs-attribute">opacity</span>: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; }
      <span class="hljs-selector-tag">to</span> { <span class="hljs-attribute">opacity</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>; }
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">@keyframes</span> fadeIn {
    <span class="hljs-selector-tag">from</span> { <span class="hljs-attribute">opacity</span>: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; }
      <span class="hljs-selector-tag">to</span> { <span class="hljs-attribute">opacity</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then apply the <code>fadeIn</code> animation to the child on parent hover (and of course set <code>display: block</code>):</p>

<pre class="lang-css s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.parent</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:hover</span> <span class="hljs-selector-class">.child</span> {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">display</span>: block;
    -webkit-<span class="hljs-attribute">animation</span>: fadeIn <span class="hljs-number">1s</span>;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">animation</span>: fadeIn <span class="hljs-number">1s</span>;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, what's going on here?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>When <code>visible</code> class is added, both <code>height</code> and <code>opacity</code> start animation without delay (0&nbsp;ms), though <code>height</code> takes 0&nbsp;ms to complete animation (equivalent of <code>display: block</code>) and <code>opacity</code> takes 600&nbsp;ms.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When <code>visible</code> class is removed, <code>opacity</code> starts animation (0&nbsp;ms delay, 400&nbsp;ms duration), and height waits 400&nbsp;ms and only then instantly (0&nbsp;ms) restores initial value (equivalent of <code>display: none</code> in the animation callback).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note, this approach is better than ones using <code>visibility</code>. In such cases, the element still occupies the space on the page, and it's not always suitable.</p>

<p>I suspect that the <em>reason</em> that transitions are disabled if <code>display</code> is changed is because of what display actually does. It does <em>not</em> change anything that could conceivably be smoothly animated.</p>

<p><code>display: none;</code> and <code>visibility: hidden;</code> are two <em>entirely</em> different things.<br>
Both do have the effect of making the element invisible, but with <code>visibility: hidden;</code> its still rendered in the layout, but just not <em>visibly</em> so.<br>
The hidden element still takes up space, and is still rendered inline or as a block or block-inline or table or whatever the <code>display</code> element tells it to render as, and takes up space accordingly.<br>
Other elements do <em>not</em> automatically move to occupy that space. The hidden element just doesnt render its actual pixels to the output.</p>

<p><code>display: none</code> on the other hand actually <em>prevents</em> the element from rendering <em>entirely</em>.<br>
It does not take up <em>any</em> layout space.<br>
Other elements that wouldve occupied some or all of the space taken up by this element now adjust to occupy that space, as if the element simply <em>did not exist at all</em>.</p>

<p><code>display</code> is not just another visual attribute.<br>
It establishes the entire rendering mode of the element, such as whether its a <code>block</code>, <code>inline</code>, <code>inline-block</code>, <code>table</code>, <code>table-row</code>, <code>table-cell</code>, <code>list-item</code>, or whatever!<br>
Each of those have very different layout ramifications, and there would be no reasonable way to animate or smoothly transition them (try to imagine a smooth transition from <code>block</code> to <code>inline</code> or vice-versa, for instance!).</p>

<p>This is why transitions are disabled if display changes (even if the change is to or from <code>none</code>  <code>none</code> isnt merely invisibility, its its own element rendering mode that means no rendering at all!).</p>

<p>What's happening above is that through 99% of the animation display is set to block while the opacity fades out. In the last moment display property is set to none.</p>

<p>And the most important bit is to retain the last frame after the animation ends using animation-fill-mode: forwards</p>

<p>My neat JavaScript trick is <strong>to separate the entire scenario into two different functions</strong>!</p>

<p>To prepare things, one global variable is declared and one event handler is defined:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp">  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> tTimeout;
  element.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">"transitionend"</span>, afterTransition, <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>);<span class="hljs-comment">//firefox</span>
  element.addEventListener(<span class="hljs-string">"webkitTransitionEnd"</span>, afterTransition, <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>);<span class="hljs-comment">//chrome</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Then, when hiding element, I use something like this: </p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp"><span class="hljs-function">function <span class="hljs-title">hide</span>()</span>{
  element.style.opacity = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
}

<span class="hljs-function">function <span class="hljs-title">afterTransition</span>()</span>{
  element.style.display = <span class="hljs-string">'none'</span>;
}
</code></pre>

<p>For reappearing the element, I am doing something like this:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">show</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
  element.<span class="hljs-property">style</span>.<span class="hljs-property">display</span> = <span class="hljs-string">'block'</span>;
  tTimeout = <span class="hljs-built_in">setTimeout</span>(timeoutShow, <span class="hljs-number">100</span>);
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">timeoutShow</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){

<p>I ran into this today, with a <code>position: fixed</code> modal that I was reusing. I couldn't keep it <code>display: none</code> and then animate it, as it just jumped into appearance, and and <code>z-index</code> (negative values, etc) did weird things as well.</p>

<p>I was also using a <code>height: 0</code> to <code>height: 100%</code>, but it only worked when the modal appeared. This is the same as if you used <code>left: -100%</code> or something.</p>

<p>Then it struck me that there was a simple answer. Et voila:</p>

<p><strong>First,</strong> your hidden modal. Notice the <code>height</code> is <code>0</code>, and check out the <code>height</code> declaration in transitions... it has a <code>500ms</code>, <em>which is longer than my <code>opacity</code> transition</em>. Remember, this affects the out-going fade-out transition: returning the modal to its default state.</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-id">#modal-overlay</span> {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">background</span>: <span class="hljs-number">#999</span>;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">background</span>: <span class="hljs-built_in">rgba</span>(<span class="hljs-number">33</span>,<span class="hljs-number">33</span>,<span class="hljs-number">33</span>,.<span class="hljs-number">2</span>);
    <span class="hljs-attribute">display</span>: block;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">overflow</span>: hidden;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">height</span>: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">width</span>: <span class="hljs-number">100%</span>;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">position</span>: fixed;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">top</span>: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">left</span>: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">opacity</span>: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">z-index</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
    -webkit-<span class="hljs-attribute">transition</span>: height <span class="hljs-number">0s</span> <span class="hljs-number">500ms</span>, opacity <span class="hljs-number">300ms</span> ease-in-out;
       -moz-<span class="hljs-attribute">transition</span>: height <span class="hljs-number">0s</span> <span class="hljs-number">500ms</span>, opacity <span class="hljs-number">300ms</span> ease-in-out;
            -ms-<span class="hljs-attribute">transition</span>: height <span class="hljs-number">0s</span> <span class="hljs-number">500ms</span>, opacity <span class="hljs-number">300ms</span> ease-in-out;
         -o-<span class="hljs-attribute">transition</span>: height <span class="hljs-number">0s</span> <span class="hljs-number">500ms</span>, opacity <span class="hljs-number">300ms</span> ease-in-out;
        <span class="hljs-attribute">transition</span>: height <span class="hljs-number">0s</span> <span class="hljs-number">500ms</span>, opacity <span class="hljs-number">300ms</span> ease-in-out;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Second,</strong> your visible modal. Say you're setting a <code>.modal-active</code> to the <code>body</code>. Now the <code>height</code> is <code>100%</code>, and my transition has also changed. I want the <code>height</code> to be instantly changed, and the <code>opacity</code> to take <code>300ms</code>.</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.modal-active</span> <span class="hljs-selector-id">#modal-overlay</span> {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">height</span>: <span class="hljs-number">100%</span>;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">opacity</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">z-index</span>: <span class="hljs-number">90000</span>;
    -webkit-<span class="hljs-attribute">transition</span>: height <span class="hljs-number">0s</span>, opacity <span class="hljs-number">300ms</span> ease-in-out;
       -moz-<span class="hljs-attribute">transition</span>: height <span class="hljs-number">0s</span>, opacity <span class="hljs-number">300ms</span> ease-in-out;
        -ms-<span class="hljs-attribute">transition</span>: height <span class="hljs-number">0s</span>, opacity <span class="hljs-number">300ms</span> ease-in-out;
         -o-<span class="hljs-attribute">transition</span>: height <span class="hljs-number">0s</span>, opacity <span class="hljs-number">300ms</span> ease-in-out;
            <span class="hljs-attribute">transition</span>: height <span class="hljs-number">0s</span>, opacity <span class="hljs-number">300ms</span> ease-in-out;
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's it, it works like a charm.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>You could also use <code>height</code> in place of <code>max-height</code> if you specify both values since <code>height:auto</code> is not allowed with <code>transition</code>s. The hover value of <code>max-height</code> needs to be greater than the <code>height</code> of the menu can possibly be.</p>

<p>JavaScript is not required, and no outrageously huge max-height is needed. Instead, set your <code>max-height</code> on your text elements, and use a font relative unit such as <code>rem</code> or <code>em</code>. This way, you can set a maximum height larger than your container, while avoiding a delay or "popping" when the menu closes:</p>

<p>After the accepted answer from Guillermo was written, the CSS
transition specification of 2012-04-03 changed the behavior of the visibility transition and <strong>now it is possible to solve this problem in a shorter way</strong>, without the use of transition-delay:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.myclass</span> &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag">div</span> {
                   <span class="hljs-attribute">transition</span>:visibility <span class="hljs-number">1s</span>, opacity <span class="hljs-number">1s</span>;
                   <span class="hljs-attribute">visibility</span>:hidden;  <span class="hljs-attribute">opacity</span>:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>
               }
<span class="hljs-selector-class">.myclass</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:hover</span> &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag">div</span>
               {   <span class="hljs-attribute">visibility</span>:visible; <span class="hljs-attribute">opacity</span>:<span class="hljs-number">1</span> }
</code></pre>

<p>The run time specified for both transitions should usually be
identical (although a slightly longer time for visibility is not a problem).</p>

<p>For a running version, see my blog post <em><a href="http://www.taccgl.org/blog/css-transition-visibility.html#visibility-opacity" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CSS Transition Visibility</a></em>.</p>

<p>W.r.t. the title of the question <em>"Transitions on the display: property"</em> and in response to comments from Rui Marques and josh to the accepted answer:</p>

<p>This solution works in cases <strong>where it is irrelevant if the display or
visibility property is used</strong> (as it probably was the case in this question).</p>

<p>It will not completely remove the element as <code>display:none</code>, just make it invisible, but it still stays in the document flow and influences the position of the following elements.</p>

<p>Transitions that completely remove the element similar to <code>display:none</code> can be done using height (as indicated by other answers and comments), max-height, or margin-top/bottom, but also see
<em><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3508605/css-transition-height-0-to-height-auto/">How can I transition height: 0; to height: auto; using CSS?</a></em> and my blog post <em><a href="https://www.taccgl.org/blog/css_transition_display.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Workarounds for CSS Transitions on the Display and Height Properties</a></em>.</p>

Both properties and both transitions are needed: The opacity property
is used to create a fade-in and fade-out animation and the visibility
property to avoid the element still reacting on mouse
events. Transitions are needed on opacity for the visual effect and on
visibility to delay hiding until the fade-out is finished.</p>

<p>I suspect anyone just starting CSS transitions quickly discovers that they don't work if you're modifying the display property (block/none) at the same time. One workaround that hasn't yet been mentioned is that you can continue to use <code>display:block/none</code> to hide/show the element, but set its opacity to 0 so that even when it's <code>display:block</code>, it's still invisible.</p>

<p>Then to fade it in, add another CSS class such as "on" which sets the opacity to 1 and defines the transition for opacity. As you may have imagined, you'll have to use JavaScript to add that "on" class to the element, but at least you're still using CSS for the actual transition.</p>

<p>P.S. If you find yourself in a situation where you need to do both <code>display:block</code>, and add class "on", at the same time, defer the latter using setTimeout. Otherwise, the browser just sees both things as happening at once and disables the transition.</p>

<p>You can get this to work the natural way you expected - using display - but you have to throttle the browser to get it to work, using either Javascript or as others have suggested a fancy trick with one tag inside another. I don't care for the inner tag as it further complicates CSS and dimensions, so here's the Javascript solution:</p>
<p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/hweyecu4/17/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/hweyecu4/17/</a></p>
<p>Starting with a box like:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash">&lt;div <span class="hljs-built_in">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"box"</span> class=<span class="hljs-string">"hidden"</span>&gt;Lorem&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>A hidden box.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">div</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.hidden</span> {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">display</span>: none;
}
<span class="hljs-selector-id">#box</span> {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">transition</span>: opacity <span class="hljs-number">1s</span>;
}
    
</code></pre>
<p>We're going to use a trick found in a related q/a, checking offsetHeight to throttle the browser instantaneously:</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/16575811/176877">https://stackoverflow.com/a/16575811/176877</a></p>
<p>First, a library formalizing the above trick:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$.fn.<span class="hljs-property">noTrnsn</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">each</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">i, tag</span>) {
        tag.<span class="hljs-property">style</span>.<span class="hljs-property">transition</span> = <span class="hljs-string">'none'</span>;
    });
};
$.fn.<span class="hljs-property">resumeTrnsn</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">each</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">i, tag</span>) {
        tag.<span class="hljs-property">offsetHeight</span>;    
        tag.<span class="hljs-property">style</span>.<span class="hljs-property">transition</span> = <span class="hljs-literal">null</span>;
    });
};
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we're going to use it to reveal a box, and fade it in:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$(<span class="hljs-string">'#button'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">on</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> tag = $(<span class="hljs-string">'#box'</span>);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (tag.<span class="hljs-title function_">hasClass</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'hidden'</span>))
        tag.<span class="hljs-title function_">noTrnsn</span>().<span class="hljs-title function_">removeClass</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'hidden'</span>)
        .<span class="hljs-title function_">css</span>({ <span class="hljs-attr">opacity</span>: <span class="hljs-number">0</span> })
        .<span class="hljs-title function_">resumeTrnsn</span>().<span class="hljs-title function_">css</span>({ <span class="hljs-attr">opacity</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span> });
    <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>
        tag.<span class="hljs-title function_">css</span>({ <span class="hljs-attr">opacity</span>: <span class="hljs-number">0</span> });
});
</code></pre>
<p>This fades the box in and out. So, <code>.noTrnsn()</code> turns off transitions, then we remove the <code>hidden</code> class, which flips <code>display</code> from <code>none</code> to its default, <code>block</code>. We then set opacity to 0 to get ready for fading in. Now that we've set the stage, we turn transitions back on, with <code>.resumeTrnsn()</code>. And finally, kick off the transition by setting opacity to 1.</p>
<p>Without the library, both the change to display and the change to opacity would've gotten us undesirable results. If we simply removed the library calls, we'd get no transitions at all.</p>
<p>Note that the above does not set display to none again at the end of the fadeout animation. We can get fancier though. Let's do so with one that fades in and grows in height from 0.</p>
<h2>Fancy!</h2>
<p><a href="https://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/hweyecu4/22/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/hweyecu4/22/</a></p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-id">#box</span> {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">transition</span>: height <span class="hljs-number">1s</span>, opacity <span class="hljs-number">1s</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>We're now transitioning both height and opacity. Note that we are not setting height, which means it is the default, <code>auto</code>. Conventionally this cannot be transitioned - moving from auto to a pixel value (like 0) will get you no transition. We're going to work around that with the library, and one more library method:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-kotlin">$.fn.wait = function (time, fn) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (time)
        <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.delay(time);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!fn)
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>;

    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> _this = <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">this</span>.queue(function (n) {
        fn.call(_this);
        n();
    });
};
</code></pre>
<p>This is a convenience method that lets us participate in jQuery's existing fx/animation queue, without requiring any of the animation framework that's now excluded in jQuery 3.x. I'm not going to explain how jQuery works, but suffice to say, the <code>.queue()</code> and <code>.stop()</code> plumbing that jQuery provides help us prevent our animations from stepping on each other.</p>
<p>Let's animate the slide down effect.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>This code begins by checking on <code>#box</code> and whether it's currently hidden, by checking on its class. But it accomplishes more using the <code>wait()</code> library call, by adding the <code>hidden</code> class at the end of the slideout/fade animation, which you'd expect to find if it is in fact hidden - something the above simpler example could not do. This happens to also enable display/hiding the element over and over, which was a bug in the previous example, because the hidden class was never restored.</p>
<p>You can also see CSS and class changes being called after <code>.noTrnsn()</code> to generally set the stage for animations, including taking measurements, like measuring what will be the final height of <code>#box</code> without showing that to the user, before calling <code>.resumeTrnsn()</code>, and animating it from that fully-set stage to its goal CSS values.</p>

<p>The key is throttling the display property. By removing the hidden class and then waiting 50&nbsp;ms, <em>then</em> starting the transition via the added class, we get it to appear and then expand like we wanted, instead of it just blipping onto the screen without any animation. Similar occurs going the other way, except we wait till the animation is over before applying hidden.</p>
<p>Note: I'm abusing <code>.animate(maxWidth)</code> here to avoid <code>setTimeout</code> race conditions. <code>setTimeout</code> is quick to introduce hidden bugs when you or someone else picks up code unaware of it. <code>.animate()</code> can easily be killed with <code>.stop()</code>. I'm just using it to put a 50&nbsp;ms or 2000&nbsp;ms delay on the standard fx queue where it's easy to find/resolve by other coders building on top of this.</p>

<p>I had a similar issue that I couldn't find the answer to. A few Google searches later led me here. Considering I didn't find the simple answer I was hoping for, I stumbled upon a solution that is both elegant and effective.</p>

<p>It turns out the <code>visibility</code> CSS property has a value <code>collapse</code> which is generally used for table items. However, if used on any other elements it effectively renders them as <em>hidden</em>, pretty much the same as <code>display: hidden</code> but with the added ability that the element doesn't take up any space and you can still animate the element in question.</p>

<p>The simplest universal solution to the problem is: feel free to specify <code>display:none</code> in your CSS, however you will have change it to <code>block</code> (or whatever else) using JavaScript, and then you'll also have to add a class to your element in question that actually does the transition <em>with setTimeout()</em>. That's all.</p>

<p>I think SalmanPK has the closest answer. It does fade an item in or out, with the following CSS animations. However, the display property does not animate smoothly, only the opacity.</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-keyword">@-webkit-keyframes</span> fadeIn {
    <span class="hljs-selector-tag">from</span> { <span class="hljs-attribute">opacity</span>: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; }
      <span class="hljs-selector-tag">to</span> { <span class="hljs-attribute">opacity</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>; }
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">@-webkit-keyframes</span> fadeOut {
    <span class="hljs-selector-tag">from</span> { <span class="hljs-attribute">opacity</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>; }
      <span class="hljs-selector-tag">to</span> { <span class="hljs-attribute">opacity</span>: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to animate the element moving from display block to display none, I can't see that it is currently possible just with CSS. You have to get the height and use a CSS animation to decrease the height. This is possible with CSS as shown in the example below, but it would be tricky to know the exact height values you need to animate for an element.</p>

<p>This solution has excellent compatibility, and I haven't seen it yet:</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong>: it uses the <code>visibility: hidden</code> trick (which is compatible with show-and-animate in one step), but it uses the combination <code>position: absolute; z-index: -1; pointer-events: none;</code> to make sure that the hidden container <strong>does not take space</strong> and <strong>does not answer to user interactions</strong>.</p>

<p>You can do this with transition events, so you build two CSS classes for the transition, one holding the animation other, holding the display none state. And you switch them after the animation is ended? In my case I can display the divs again if I press a button, and remove both classes.</p>

<p>Instead of using <code>display</code> you could store the element 'off-screen' until you needed it, and then set its position to where you want it and transform it at the same time. This brings up a whole host of other design issues though, so your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>You probably wouldn't want to use <code>display</code> anyway, as you'd want the content to be accessible to screen readers, which for the most part try to obey rules for visibility - i.e., if it shouldn't be visible to the eye, it won't show up as content to the agent.</p>

Transitions are needed on opacity for the visual effect and on\nvisibility to delay hiding until the fade-out is finished.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I suspect anyone just starting CSS transitions quickly discovers that they don\u0026apos;t work if you\u0026apos;re modifying the display property (block/none) at the same time. One workaround that hasn\u0026apos;t yet been mentioned is that you can continue to use \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;display:block/none\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to hide/show the element, but set its opacity to 0 so that even when it\u0026apos;s \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;display:block\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, it\u0026apos;s still invisible.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Then to fade it in, add another CSS class such as \u0026quot;on\u0026quot; which sets the opacity to 1 and defines the transition for opacity. As you may have imagined, you\u0026apos;ll have to use JavaScript to add that \u0026quot;on\u0026quot; class to the element, but at least you\u0026apos;re still using CSS for the actual transition.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;P.S. If you find yourself in a situation where you need to do both \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;display:block\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, and add class \u0026quot;on\u0026quot;, at the same time, defer the latter using setTimeout. Otherwise, the browser just sees both things as happening at once and disables the transition.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You can get this to work the natural way you expected - using display - but you have to throttle the browser to get it to work, using either Javascript or as others have suggested a fancy trick with one tag inside another. I don\u0026apos;t care for the inner tag as it further complicates CSS and dimensions, so here\u0026apos;s the Javascript solution:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://jsfiddle.net/b9chris/hweyecu4/17/\u0026quot;
