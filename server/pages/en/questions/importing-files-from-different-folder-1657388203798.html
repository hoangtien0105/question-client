This approach lets you even successfully work with modules that are located parallel to the script you are executing.\nln -s ~/path/to/original/module/my_module ~/symlink/inside/the/destination/directory/my_module\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution28","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"If you have multiple folders and sub folders, you can always import any class or module from the main directory.\nFor example: Tree structure of the project\nProject \n main.py\n .gitignore\n|\n src\n     model\n     |     user_model.py\n     |controller\n           user_controller.py\n\nNow, if you want to import &quot;UserModel&quot; class from user_model.py in main.py file, you can do that using:\nfrom src.model.user_model.py import UserModel\n\nAlso, you can import same class in user_controller.py file using same line:\nfrom src.model.user_model.py import UserModel\n\nOverall, you can give reference of main project directory to import classes and files in any python file inside Project directory.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution29","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"This problem may be due Pycharm\nI had the same problem while using Pycharm.

<p>Note: This answer was intended for a very specific question. For most programmers coming here from a search engine, this is not the answer you are looking for. Typically you would structure your files into packages (see other answers) instead of modifying the search path.</p>
<hr>
<p>By default, you can't. When importing a file, Python only searches the directory that the entry-point script is running from and <code>sys.path</code> which includes locations such as the package installation directory (it's actually <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path" rel="noreferrer">a little more complex</a> than this, but this covers most cases).</p>
<p>However, you can add to the Python path at runtime:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-comment"># some_file.py</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> sys
<span class="hljs-comment"># insert at 1, 0 is the script path (or '' in REPL)</span>
sys.path.insert(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'/path/to/application/app/folder'</span>)

<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> file

<p>In Python 3.4 and later, you can <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importing-a-source-file-directly" rel="noreferrer">import from a source file directly (link to documentation)</a>. This is not the simplest solution, but I'm including this answer for completeness.</p>

<p>Here is an example. First, the file to be imported, named <code>foo.py</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">announce</span>():
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Imported!"</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>The code that imports the file above, inspired heavily by the example in the documentation:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> importlib.util

<span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">module_from_file</span>(<span class="hljs-params">module_name, file_path</span>):
    spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(module_name, file_path)
    module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
    spec.loader.exec_module(module)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> module

foo = module_from_file(<span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"/path/to/foo.py"</span>)

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> __name__ == <span class="hljs-string">"__main__"</span>:
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(foo)
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">dir</span>(foo))
    foo.announce()
</code></pre>

<p>The output:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">&lt;module <span class="hljs-string">'foo'</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">'/path/to/foo.py'</span>&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>Note that the variable name, the module name, and the filename need not match. This code still works:</p>

    module = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec)
    spec.loader.exec_module(module)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> module

baz = module_from_file(<span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"/path/to/foo.py"</span>)

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> __name__ == <span class="hljs-string">"__main__"</span>:

    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">dir</span>(baz))

<p>Hint: have <code>__init__.py</code> at every directory level. You might need <code>python -m application.app2.some_folder.some_file</code> (leaving off .py) which you run from the top level directory or have that top level directory in your PYTHONPATH. <em>Phew!</em></p>

<p>Using <code>sys.path.append</code> with an absolute path is not ideal when moving the application to other environments. Using a relative path won't always work because the current working directory depends on how the script was invoked.</p>
<p>Since the application folder structure is fixed, we can use <code>os.path</code> to get the full path of the module we wish to import. For example, if this is the structure:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">/home/me/application/app2/some_folder/vanilla.py
/home/me/application/app2/another_folder/mango.py
</code></pre>
<p>And let's say that you want to import the <em>mango</em> module. You could do the following in <em>vanilla.py</em>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> sys, os.path
mango_dir = (os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), <span class="hljs-string">'..'</span>))
+ <span class="hljs-string">'/another_folder/'</span>)
sys.path.append(mango_dir)
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> mango
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, you don't need the <em>mango_dir</em> variable.</p>
<p>To understand how this works look at this interactive session example:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> os
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>mydir = <span class="hljs-string">'/home/me/application/app2/some_folder'</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>newdir = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(mydir, <span class="hljs-string">'..'</span>))
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>newdir
    <span class="hljs-string">'/home/me/application/app2'</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>newdir = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(mydir, <span class="hljs-string">'..'</span>)) + <span class="hljs-string">'/another_folder'</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>newdir
<span class="hljs-string">'/home/me/application/app2/another_folder'</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>
</code></pre>
<p>And check the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html" rel="noreferrer">os.path</a> documentation.</p>
<p>Also worth noting that dealing with multiple folders is made easier when using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages" rel="noreferrer">packages</a>, as one can use dotted module names.</p>

<p>And when using Windows both <code>\</code> and <code>/</code> can be used as separator for file names and of course you must double <code>\</code> into Python strings,<br>

<p>I bumped into the same question several times, so I would like to share my solution.</p>

<h2>Python Version: 3.X</h2>

<p>The following solution is for someone who develops your application in Python version 3.X because <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/" rel="noreferrer">Python 2 is not supported since Jan/1/2020</a>.</p>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>

<p>In python 3, you don't need <code>__init__.py</code> in your project subdirectory due to the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0420/" rel="noreferrer">Implicit Namespace Packages</a>. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37139786/is-init-py-not-required-for-packages-in-python-3-3">Is <strong>init</strong>.py not required for packages in Python 3.3+</a>  </p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">Project 
 main.py
 .gitignore
|
 a
|    file_a.py
|
 b
     file_b.py
</code></pre>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<p>In <code>file_b.py</code>, I would like to import a class <code>A</code> in <code>file_a.py</code> under the folder a.</p>

<h2>Solutions</h2>

<h3>#1 A quick but dirty way</h3>

<p>Without installing the package like you are currently developing a new project</p>

<p>Using the <code>try catch</code> to check if the errors. Code example: </p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> sys
<span class="hljs-keyword">try</span>:
    <span class="hljs-comment"># The insertion index should be 1 because index 0 is this file</span>
    sys.path.insert(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'/absolute/path/to/folder/a'</span>)  <span class="hljs-comment"># the type of path is string</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment"># because the system path already have the absolute path to folder a</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment"># so it can recognize file_a.py while searching </span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> file_a <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> A
<span class="hljs-keyword">except</span> (ModuleNotFoundError, ImportError) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> e:
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"{} fileure"</span>.<span class="hljs-built_in">format</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">type</span>(e)))
<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Import succeeded"</span>)
</code></pre>

<h3>#2 Install your package</h3>

<p>Once you installed your application (in this post, the tutorial of installation is not included)</p>

<p>You can simply</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">try</span>:
    <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> __future__ <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> absolute_import
    <span class="hljs-comment"># now it can reach class A of file_a.py in folder a </span>
    <span class="hljs-comment"># by relative import</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> ..a.file_a <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> A  
<span class="hljs-keyword">except</span> (ModuleNotFoundError, ImportError) <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> e:
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"{} fileure"</span>.<span class="hljs-built_in">format</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">type</span>(e)))
<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Import succeeded"</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>If the purpose of loading a module from a specific path is to assist you during the development of a custom module, you can create a symbolic link in the same folder of the test script that points to the root of the custom module. This module reference will take precedence over any other modules installed of the same name for any script run in that folder.</p>

<p>I tested this on Linux but it should work in any modern OS that supports symbolic links.</p>

<p>One advantage to this approach is that you can you can point to a module that's sitting in your own local SVC branch working copy which can greatly simplify the development cycle time and reduce failure modes of managing different versions of the module.</p>

<p>Wow, I did not expect to spend so much time on this. The following worked for me:</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/59598549/848353">WY Hsu's</a> 1st solution worked for me. I have reposted it with an <strong>absolute file reference</strong> for clarity:</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Solution</strong>: However, this also worked for me:</p>

<p>Although, I do not understand why it works. I thought the dot is a reference to the current directory. However, when printing out the paths to the current folder, the current directory is already listed at the top:</p>

<p><strong>In case anyone still looking for a solution. This worked for me.</strong></p>
<p>Python adds the folder containing the script you launch to the PYTHONPATH, so if you run</p>
<pre class="lang-sh s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash">python application/app2/some_folder/some_file.py
</code></pre>
<p>Only the folder application/app2/some_folder is added to the path (not the base dir that you're executing the command in). Instead, run your file as a module and add a __init__.py in your some_folder directory.</p>
<pre class="lang-sh s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash">python -m application.app2.some_folder.some_file

<p>This will add the base dir to the python path, and then classes will be accessible via a non-relative import.</p>

<p>You can use importlib to import modules where you want to import a module from a folder using a string like so:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> importlib

scriptName = <span class="hljs-string">'Snake'</span>

script = importlib.import_module(<span class="hljs-string">'Scripts\\.%s'</span> % scriptName)
</code></pre>

<p>This example has a main.py which is the above code then a folder called Scripts and then you can call whatever you need from this folder by changing the <code>scriptName</code> variable. You can then use <code>script</code> to reference to this module. such as if I have a function called <code>Hello()</code> in the Snake module you can run this function by doing so:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">script.Hello()

<p>I usually create a symlink to the module I want to import. The symlink makes sure Python interpreter can locate the module inside the current directory (the script you are importing the other module into); later on when your work is over, you can remove the symlink. Also, you should ignore symlinks in .gitignore, so that, you wouldn't accidentally commit symlinked modules to your repo. This approach lets you even successfully work with modules that are located parallel to the script you are executing.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">ln -s ~/path/to/original/module/my_module ~/symlink/inside/the/destination/directory/my_module

<p>If you have multiple folders and sub folders, you can always import any class or module from the <strong>main directory</strong>.</p>
<p>For example: Tree structure of the project</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">Project 
 main.py
 .gitignore
|
 src
     model
     |     user_model.py
     |controller
           user_controller.py
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if you want to import <strong>"UserModel"</strong> class from user_model.py in <strong>main.py</strong> file, you can do that using:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> src.model.user_model.py <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> UserModel
</code></pre>
<p>Also, you can import same class in <strong>user_controller.py</strong> file using same line:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> src.model.user_model.py <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> UserModel
</code></pre>
<p>Overall, you can give reference of main project directory to import classes and files in any python file inside <strong>Project</strong> directory.</p>

<h2>This problem may be due Pycharm</h2>
<p>I had the same problem while using Pycharm. I had this project structure</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">skylake\
   backend\
      apps\
          example.py
      configuration\
          settings.py
   frontend\
      ...some_stuff
</code></pre>
<p>and code <code>from configuration import settings</code> in example.py raised import error</p>
<p>the problem was that when I opened Pycharm, it considered that skylake is root path and ran this code</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">sys.path.extend([<span class="hljs-string">'D:\\projects\\skylake'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'D:/projects/skylake'</span>])
</code></pre>
<p>To fix this I just marked backend directory as source root
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6yaVi.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6yaVi.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
