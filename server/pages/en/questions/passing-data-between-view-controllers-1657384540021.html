You would use this method if you wanted to pass an object/value from one view controller to another view controller that you may be pushing on to a navigation stack.\nFor this example, we will have ViewControllerA and ViewControllerB\nTo pass a BOOL value from ViewControllerA to ViewControllerB we would do the following.\n\nin ViewControllerB.h create a property for the BOOL\n @property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL isSomethingEnabled;\n\n\nin ViewControllerA you need to tell it about ViewControllerB so use an\n #import &quot;ViewControllerB.h&quot;\n\n\n\nThen where you want to load the view, for example, didSelectRowAtIndex or some IBAction, you need to set the property in ViewControllerB before you push it onto the navigation stack.\n    ViewControllerB *viewControllerB = [[ViewControllerB alloc] initWithNib:@&quot;ViewControllerB&quot; bundle:nil];\n    viewControllerB.isSomethingEnabled = YES;\n    [self pushViewController:viewControllerB animated:YES];\n\nThis will set isSomethingEnabled in ViewControllerB to BOOL value YES.\nPassing Data Forward using Segues\nIf you are using Storyboards you are most likely using segues and will need this procedure to pass data forward. This is similar to the above but instead of passing the data before you push the view controller, you use a method called\n-(void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender\n\nSo to pass a BOOL from ViewControllerA to ViewControllerB we would do the following:\n\nin ViewControllerB.h create a property for the BOOL\n @property (nonatomic, assign) BOOL isSomethingEnabled;\n\n\nin ViewControllerA you need to tell it about ViewControllerB, so use an\n #import &quot;ViewControllerB.h&quot;\n\n\nCreate the segue from ViewControllerA to ViewControllerB on the storyboard and give it an identifier. In this example we&apos;ll call it &quot;showDetailSegue&quot;\n\nNext, we need to add the method to ViewControllerA that is called when any segue is performed. Because of this we need to detect which segue was called and then do something. In our example, we will check for &quot;showDetailSegue&quot; and if that&apos;s performed, we will pass our BOOL value to ViewControllerB\n -(void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender{\n     if([segue.identifier isEqualToString:@&quot;showDetailSegue&quot;]){\n         ViewControllerB *controller = (ViewControllerB *)segue.destinationViewController;\n         controller.isSomethingEnabled = YES;\n     }\n }\n\n\n\nIf you have your views embedded in a navigation controller, you need to change the method above slightly to the following\n    -(void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender{\n        if([segue.identifier isEqualToString:@&quot;showDetailSegue&quot;]){\n            UINavigationController *navController = (UINavigationController *)segue.destinationViewController;\n            ViewControllerB *controller = (ViewControllerB *)navController.topViewController;\n            controller.isSomethingEnabled = YES;\n        }\n    }\n\nThis will set isSomethingEnabled in ViewControllerB to BOOL value YES.\nPassing Data Back\nTo pass data back from ViewControllerB to ViewControllerA you need to use Protocols and Delegates or Blocks, the latter can be used as a loosely coupled mechanism for callbacks.\nTo do this we will make ViewControllerA a delegate of ViewControllerB. This allows ViewControllerB to send a message back to ViewControllerA enabling us to send data back.\nFor ViewControllerA to be a delegate of ViewControllerB it must conform to ViewControllerB&apos;s protocol which we have to specify. This tells ViewControllerA which methods it must implement.\n\nIn ViewControllerB.h, below the #import, but above @interface you specify the protocol.\n @class ViewControllerB;\n\n @protocol ViewControllerBDelegate &lt;NSObject&gt;\n - (void)addItemViewController:(ViewControllerB *)controller didFinishEnteringItem:(NSString *)item;\n @end\n\n\nNext still in the ViewControllerB.h, you need to set up a delegate property and synthesize in ViewControllerB.m\n @property (nonatomic, weak) id &lt;ViewControllerBDelegate&gt; delegate;\n\n\nIn ViewControllerB we call a message on the delegate when we pop the view controller.\n NSString *itemToPassBack = @&quot;Pass this value back to ViewControllerA&quot;;\n [self.delegate addItemViewController:self didFinishEnteringItem:itemToPassBack];\n\n\nThat&apos;s it for ViewControllerB. Now in ViewControllerA.h, tell ViewControllerA to import ViewControllerB and conform to its protocol.\n #import &quot;ViewControllerB.h&quot;\n\n @interface ViewControllerA : UIViewController &lt;ViewControllerBDelegate&gt;\n\n\nIn ViewControllerA.m implement the following method from our protocol\n - (void)addItemViewController:(ViewControllerB *)controller didFinishEnteringItem:(NSString *)item\n {\n     NSLog(@&quot;This was returned from ViewControllerB %@&quot;, item);\n }\n\n\nBefore pushing viewControllerB to navigation stack we need to tell  ViewControllerB that ViewControllerA is its delegate, otherwise we will get an error.\n ViewControllerB *viewControllerB = [[ViewControllerB alloc] initWithNib:@&quot;ViewControllerB&quot; bundle:nil];\n viewControllerB.delegate = self\n [[self navigationController] pushViewController:viewControllerB animated:YES];\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nUsing Delegation to Communicate With Other View Controllers in the View Controller Programming Guide\nDelegate Pattern\n\nNSNotification center\nIt&apos;s another way to pass data.\n// Add an observer in controller(s) where you want to receive data\n[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(handleDeepLinking:) name:@&quot;handleDeepLinking&quot; object:nil];\n\n-(void) handleDeepLinking:(NSNotification *) notification {\n    id someObject = notification.object // Some custom object that was passed with notification fire.\n}\n\n// Post notification\nid someObject;\n[NSNotificationCenter.defaultCenter postNotificationName:@&quot;handleDeepLinking&quot; object:someObject];\n\nPassing Data back from one class to another (A class can be any controller, Network/session manager, UIView subclass or any other class)\nBlocks are anonymous functions.\nThis example passes data from Controller B to Controller A\nDefine a block\n@property void(^selectedVoucherBlock)(NSString *); // in ContollerA.h\n\nAdd block handler (listener)\nWhere you need a value (for example, you need your API response in ControllerA or you need ContorllerB data on A)\n// In ContollerA.m\n\n- (void)viewDidLoad {\n    [super viewDidLoad];\n    __unsafe_unretained typeof(self) weakSelf = self;\n    self.selectedVoucherBlock = ^(NSString *voucher) {\n        weakSelf-&gt;someLabel.text = voucher;\n    };\n}\n\nGo to Controller B\nUIStoryboard *storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@&quot;Main&quot; bundle:nil];\nControllerB *vc = [storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@&quot;ControllerB&quot;];\nvc.sourceVC = self;\n    [self.navigationController pushViewController:vc animated:NO];\n\nFire block\n-(void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:\n(NSIndexPath *)indexPath {\n    NSString *voucher = vouchersArray[indexPath.row];\n    if (sourceVC.selectVoucherBlock) {\n        sourceVC.selectVoucherBlock(voucher);\n    }\n    [self.navigationController popToViewController:sourceVC animated:YES];\n}\n\nAnother Working Example for Blocks\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/passing-data-between-view-controllers-1657384540021#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Swift\nThere are tons and tons of explanations here and around Stack Overflow, but if you are a beginner just trying to get something basic to work, try watching this YouTube tutorial (It&apos;s what helped me to finally understand how to do it).\n\nYouTube tutorial: How to send data through segue (Swift)\n\nPassing data forward to the next View Controller\nThe following is an example based on the video. The idea is to pass a string from the text field in the First View Controller to the label in the Second View Controller.\n\nCreate the storyboard layout in the Interface Builder. To make the segue, you just Control click on the button and drag over to the Second View Controller.\nFirst View Controller\nThe code for the First View Controller is\nimport UIKit\n\nclass FirstViewController: UIViewController {\n\n    @IBOutlet weak var textField: UITextField!\n\n    // This function is called before the segue\n    override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {\n\n        // Get a reference to the second view controller\n        let secondViewController = segue.destination as!

This video is a very clear walk though of that process:\n\nYouTube tutorial: iOS Swift Basics Tutorial: Protocols and Delegates But also read this post to make sure you don&apos;t get into a strong reference cycle.\n\nThe following is an example based on the video (with a few modifications).\n\nCreate the storyboard layout in the Interface Builder. Again, to make the segue, you just Control drag from the button to the Second View Controller. Set the segue identifier to showSecondViewController. Also, don&apos;t forget to hook up the outlets and actions using the names in the following code.\nFirst View Controller\nThe code for the First View Controller is\nimport UIKit\n\nclass FirstViewController: UIViewController, DataEnteredDelegate {\n\n    @IBOutlet weak var label: UILabel!\n\n    override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {\n        if segue.identifier == &quot;showSecondViewController&quot; {\n            let secondViewController = segue.destination as!

A model is the opposite of a view -- a view knows how to display data, but it knows nothing about what to do with data, whereas a model knows everything about how to work with data, but nothing about how to display it. Models can be complicated, but they don&apos;t have to be -- the model for your app might be as simple as an array of strings or dictionaries.\nThe role of a controller is to mediate between view and model. Therefore, they need a reference to one or more view objects and one or more model objects. Let&apos;s say that your model is an array of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing one row in your table. The root view for your app displays that table, and it might be responsible for loading the array from a file. When the user decides to add a new row to the table, they tap some button and your controller creates a new (mutable) dictionary and adds it to the array. In order to fill in the row, the controller creates a detail view controller and gives it the new dictionary. The detail view controller fills in the dictionary and returns.

For example -\n\nDirect initialization after the allocation of another class.\nDelegation - for passing data back\nNotification - for broadcasting data to multiple classes at a single time\nSaving in NSUserDefaults - for accessing it later\nSingleton classes\nDatabases and other storage mechanisms, like p-list files, etc.\n\nBut for the simple scenario of passing a value to a different class whose allocation is done in the current class, the most common and preferred method would be the direct setting of values after allocation. This is done as follows:\nWe can understand it using two controllers - Controller1 and Controller2\nSuppose in Controller1 class you want to create the Controller2 object and push it with a String value being passed. This can be done as this:\n- (void)pushToController2 {\n\n    Controller2 *obj = [[Controller2 alloc] initWithNib:@&quot;Controller2&quot; bundle:nil];\n    [obj passValue:@&quot;String&quot;];\n    [self pushViewController:obj animated:YES];\n}\n\nIn the implementation of the Controller2 class there will be this function as:\n@interface Controller2  : NSObject\n\n@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString* stringPassed;\n\n@end\n\n@implementation Controller2\n\n@synthesize stringPassed = _stringPassed;\n\n- (void) passValue:(NSString *)value {\n\n    _stringPassed = value; // Or self.stringPassed = value\n}\n\n@end\n\nYou can also directly set the properties of the Controller2 class in the similar way as this:\n- (void)pushToController2 {\n\n    Controller2 *obj = [[Controller2 alloc] initWithNib:@&quot;Controller2&quot; bundle:nil];\n    [obj setStringPassed:@&quot;String&quot;];\n    [self pushViewController:obj animated:YES];\n}\n\nTo pass multiple values, you can use the multiple parameters like:\nController2 *obj = [[Controller2 alloc] initWithNib:@&quot;Controller2&quot; bundle:nil];\n[obj passValue:@String1 andValues:objArray withDate:date];\n\nOr if you need to pass more than three parameters which are related to a common feature, you can store the values in a model class and pass that modelObject to the next class\nModelClass *modelObject = [[ModelClass alloc] init];\nmodelObject.property1 = _property1;\nmodelObject.property2 = _property2;\nmodelObject.property3 = _property3;\n\nController2 *obj = [[Controller2 alloc] initWithNib:@&quot;Controller2&quot; bundle:nil];\n[obj passmodel: modelObject];\n\nSo in short, if you want to -\n\nset the private variables of the second class initialise the values by calling a custom function and passing the values.\nsetProperties do it by directlyInitialising it using the setter method.\npass more that 3-4 values related to each other in some manner, then create a model class and set values to its object and pass the object using any of the above process.\n\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/passing-data-between-view-controllers-1657384540021#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"After more research it seemed that protocols and delegates were the correct/Apple preferred way of doing this.\nI ended up using this example (in the iPhone development SDK):\nSharing data between view controllers and other objects\nIt worked fine and allowed me to pass a string and an array forward and back between my views.\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/passing-data-between-view-controllers-1657384540021#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I find simplest and most elegant version with passing blocks.\nLet&apos;s name view controller that waits for returned data as &quot;A&quot; and returning view controller as &quot;B&quot;.

The specific example given asks about passing information between views, but given the self-stated newness to iOS, the original poster likely meant between viewControllers, not between views (without any involvement from the ViewControllers). It seems that all the answers focus on two view controllers, but what if the app evolves to need to involve more than two view controllers in the information exchange?\nThe original poster also asked about Singletons and the use of the AppDelegate. These questions need to be answered.\nTo help anyone else looking at this question, who wants a full answer, I&apos;m going to attempt to provide it.\nApplication Scenarios\nRather than having a highly hypothetical, abstract discussion, it helps to have concrete applications in mind. To help define a two-view-controller situation and a more-than-two-view-controller situation, I am going to define two concrete application scenarios.\nScenario one: maximum two view controllers ever need to share information.\nSee diagram one.\n\nThere are two view controllers in the application. There is a ViewControllerA (Data Entry Form), and View Controller B (Product List). The items selected in the product list must match the items displayed in the text box in the data entry form. In this scenario, ViewControllerA and ViewControllerB must communicate directly with each other and no other view controllers.\nScenario two: more than two view controllers need to share the same information.\nSee diagram two.\n\nThere are four view controllers in the application. It is a tab-based application for managing home inventory. Three view controllers present differently filtered views of the same data:\n\nViewControllerA - Luxury Items\nViewControllerB - Non-insured Items\nViewControllerC - Entire Home Inventory\nViewControllerD - Add New Item Form\n\nAny time an individual item is created or edited, it must also synchronize with the other view controllers. For example, if we add a boat in ViewControllerD, but it is not yet insured, then the boat must appear when the user goes to ViewControllerA (Luxury Items), and also ViewControllerC (Entire Home Inventory), but not when the user goes to ViewControllerB (Non-insured Items). We need be concerned with not only adding new items, but also deleting items (which may be allowed from any of the four view controllers), or editing existing items (which may be allowed from the &quot;Add New Item Form&quot;, repurposing the same for editing).\nSince all the view controllers do need to share the same data, all four view controllers need to remain in synchronization, and therefore there needs to be some sort of communication to all other view controllers, whenever any single view controller changes the underlying data. It should be fairly obvious that we do not want each view controller communicating directly with each other view controller in this scenario. In case it is not obvious, consider if we had 20 different view controllers (rather than just 4). How difficult and error-prone would it be to notify each of the other 19 view controllers any time one view controller made a change?\nThe Solutions: Delegates and the Observer Pattern, and Singletons\nIn scenario one, we have several viable solutions, as other answers have given\n\nsegues\ndelegates\nsetting properties on view controllers directly\nNSUserDefaults (actually a poor choice)\n\nIn scenario two, we have other viable solutions:\n\nObserver Pattern\nSingletons\n\nA singleton is an instance of a class, that instance being the only instance in existence during its lifetime. A singleton gets its name from the fact that it is the single instance. Normally developers who use singletons have special class methods for accessing them.\n+ (HouseholdInventoryManager*) sharedManager; {\n    static dispatch_once_t onceQueue;\n    static HouseholdInventoryManager* _sharedInstance;\n\n    // dispatch_once is guaranteed to only be executed\n    // once in the lifetime of the application\n    dispatch_once(&amp;onceQueue, ^{\n        _sharedInstance = [[self alloc] init];\n    });\n    return _sharedInstance;\n}\n\nNow that we understand what a singleton is, let&apos;s discuss how a singleton fits into the observer pattern. The observer pattern is used for one object to respond to changes by another object. In the second scenario, we have four different view controllers, who all want to know about changes to the underlying data. The &quot;underlying data&quot; should belong to a single instance, a singleton. The &quot;know about changes&quot; is accomplished by observing changes made to the singleton.\nThe home inventory application would have a single instance of a class which is designed to manage a list of inventory items. The manager would manage a collection of household items. The following is a class definition for the data manager:\n#import &lt;Foundation/Foundation.h&gt;\n\n@class JGCHouseholdInventoryItem;\n\n@interface HouseholdInventoryManager : NSObject\n/*!\n The global singleton for accessing application data\n */\n+ (HouseholdInventoryManager*) sharedManager;\n\n\n- (NSArray *) entireHouseholdInventory;\n- (NSArray *) luxuryItems;\n- (NSArray *) nonInsuredItems;\n\n- (void) addHouseholdItemToHomeInventory:(JGCHouseholdInventoryItem*)item;\n- (void) editHouseholdItemInHomeInventory:(JGCHouseholdInventoryItem*)item;\n- (void) deleteHoueholdItemFromHomeInventory:(JGCHouseholdInventoryItem*)item;\n@end\n\nWhen the collection of home inventory items changes, the view controllers need to be made aware of this change. The class definition above does not make it obvious how this will happen. We need to follow the observer pattern. The view controllers must formally observe the sharedManager. There are two ways to observe another object:\n\nKey-Value-Observing (KVO)\nNSNotificationCenter.\n\nIn scenario two, we do not have a single property of the HouseholdInventoryManager which could be observed using KVO. Because we do not have a single property which is easily observable, the observer pattern, in this case, must be implemented using NSNotificationCenter. Each of the four view controllers would subscribe to notifications, and the sharedManager would send notifications to the notification center when appropriate. The inventory manager does not need to know anything about the view controllers or instances of any other classes which may be interested in knowing when the collection of inventory items changes; the NSNotificationCenter takes care of these implementation details. The View Controllers simply subscribe to notifications, and the data manager simply posts notifications.\nMany beginner programmers take advantage of the fact that there is always exactly one Application Delegate in the lifetime of the application, which is globally accessible. Beginning programmers use this fact to stuff objects and functionality into the appDelegate as a convenience for access from anywhere else in the application. Just because the AppDelegate is a singleton doesn&apos;t mean it should replace all other singletons. This is a poor practice as it places too much burden on one class, breaking good object-oriented practices. Each class should have a clear role that is easily explained, often just by the name of the class.\nAny time your Application Delegate starts to get bloated, start to remove functionality into singletons. For example, the Core Data Stack should not be left in the AppDelegate, but should instead be put in its own class, a coreDataManager class.\nReferences\n\nManaging Data Flow Between View Controllers\nPassing Data Between View Controllers\nAsynchronous JSON Requests in Objective-C\n\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/passing-data-between-view-controllers-1657384540021#solution7","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Passing data back from ViewController 2 (destination) to viewController 1 (source) is the more interesting thing.\nAssuming you use storyBoard, these are all the ways I found out:\n\nDelegate\nNotification\nUser defaults\nSingleton\n\nThose were discussed here already.\nI found there are more ways:\nUsing Block callbacks:\nUse it in the prepareForSegue method in the VC1\nNextViewController *destinationVC = (NextViewController *) segue.destinationViewController;\n[destinationVC setDidFinishUsingBlockCallback:^(NextViewController *destinationVC)\n{\n    self.blockLabel.text = destination.blockTextField.text;\n}];\n\nUsing storyboards Unwind (Exit)\nImplement a method with a UIStoryboardSegue argument in  VC 1,like this one:\n-(IBAction)UnWindDone:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue { }\n\nIn the storyBoard, hook the &quot;return&quot; button to the green Exit button (Unwind) of the vc.

Some answers above mentioned storyboards and segues already but still relied on delegation.  Defining delegates certainly works but some people may find it easier to pass pointers or code blocks.\n\nWith UINavigators and segues, there are easy ways of passing information to the subservient controller and getting the information back.  ARC makes passing pointers to things derived from NSObjects simple so if you want the subservient controller to add/change/modify some data for you, pass it a pointer to a mutable instance.  Blocks make passing actions easy so if you want the subservient controller to invoke an action on your higher level controller, pass it a block.  You define the block to accept any number of arguments that makes sense to you.  You can also design the API to use multiple blocks if that suits things better.\n\nHere are two trivial examples of the segue glue.  The first is straightforward showing one parameter passed for input, the second for output.\n\n// Prepare the destination view controller by passing it the input we want it to work on\n// and the results we will look at when the user has navigated back to this controller&apos;s view.\n\n- (void)prepareForSegue:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue sender:(id)sender\n{\n    [[segue destinationViewController]\n\n     // This parameter gives the next controller the data it works on.\n     segueHandoffWithInput:self.dataForNextController\n\n     // This parameter allows the next controller to pass back results\n     // by virtue of both controllers having a pointer to the same object.\n     andResults:self.resultsFromNextController];\n}\n\n\nThis second example shows passing a callback block for the second argument.

Probably one of the biggest architectural decisions lies on how the model code will be shared or accessed throughout the app.\nI wrote a blog post about this a while back: Sharing Model Code. Here&apos;s a brief summary:\nShared data\nOne approach is to share pointers to the model objects between view controllers.\n\nBrute force iteration on view controllers (in Navigation or Tab Bar Controller) to set the data\nSet data in prepareForSegue (if storyboards) or init (if programmatic)\n\nSince prepare for segue is the most common here is an example:\noverride func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: AnyObject?) {\n    var next = segue.destinationViewController as NextViewController\n    next.dataSource = dataSource\n}\n\nIndependent access\nAnother approach is to handle a screen full of data at a time and instead of coupling the view controllers to each other couple each view controller to single data source that they can get to independently.\nThe most common way I&apos;ve seen this done is a singleton instance. So if your singleton object was DataAccess you could do the following in the viewDidLoad method of UIViewController:\nfunc viewDidLoad() {\n    super.viewDidLoad()\n    var data = dataAccess.requestData()\n}\n\nThere are addition tools that also help pass along data:\n\nKey-Value Observing\nNSNotification\nCore Data\nNSFetchedResultsController\nData Source\n\nCore Data\nThe nice thing about Core Data is that it has inverse relationships. So if you want to just give a NotesViewController the notes object you can because it&apos;ll have an inverse relationship to something else like the notebook. If you need data on the notebook in the NotesViewController you can walk back up the object graph by doing the following:\nlet notebookName = note.notebook.name\n\nRead more about this in my blog post: Sharing Model Code\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/passing-data-between-view-controllers-1657384540021#solution22","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"If you want to pass data from ViewControlerOne to ViewControllerTwo, try these...\nDo these in ViewControlerOne.h:\n @property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *str1;\n\nDo these in ViewControllerTwo.h:\n @property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *str2;\n\nSynthesize str2 in ViewControllerTwo.m:\n@interface ViewControllerTwo ()\n@end\n@implementation ViewControllerTwo\n@synthesize str2;\n\nDo these in ViewControlerOne.m:\n - (void)viewDidLoad\n {\n   [super viewDidLoad];\n\n   // Data or string you wants to pass in ViewControllerTwo...\n   self.str1 = @&quot;hello world&quot;;\n }\n\nO the buttons click event, do this:\n-(IBAction)ButtonClicked\n{\n  // Navigation on buttons click event from ViewControlerOne to ViewControlerTwo with transferring data or string..\n  ViewControllerTwo *objViewTwo = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@&quot;ViewControllerTwo&quot;];\n  obj.str2 = str1;\n  [self.navigationController pushViewController: objViewTwo animated:YES];\n}\n\nDo these in ViewControllerTwo.m:\n- (void)viewDidLoad\n{\n  [super viewDidLoad];\n  NSLog(@&quot;%@&quot;, str2);\n}\n\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/passing-data-between-view-controllers-1657384540021#solution23","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"You can save data in an App delegate to access it across view controllers in your application.

<p>How do I transfer the data from one view to another? I will be holding the selections on the <code>UITableView</code> in an array, but how do I then pass that back to the previous data entry form view so it can be saved along with the other data to Core Data on submission of the form?</p>
<p>I have surfed around and seen some people declare an array in the app delegate. I read something about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern" rel="noreferrer">singletons</a>, but I don't understand what these are and I read something about creating a data model.</p>

<p>This question seems to be very popular here on Stack&nbsp;Overflow so I thought I would try and give a better answer to help out people starting in the world of iOS like me.</p>
<p><strong>Passing Data Forward</strong></p>
<p>Passing data forward to a view controller from another view controller. You would use this method if you wanted to pass an object/value from one view controller to another view controller that you may be pushing on to a navigation stack.</p>
<p>For this example, we will have <code>ViewControllerA</code> and <code>ViewControllerB</code></p>
<p>To pass a <code>BOOL</code> value from <code>ViewControllerA</code> to <code>ViewControllerB</code> we would do the following.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>in <code>ViewControllerB.h</code> create a property for the <code>BOOL</code></p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec"> <span class="hljs-keyword">@property</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">nonatomic</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">assign</span>) <span class="hljs-type">BOOL</span> isSomethingEnabled;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>in <code>ViewControllerA</code> you need to tell it about <code>ViewControllerB</code> so use an</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"> <span class="hljs-meta">#import <span class="hljs-string">"ViewControllerB.h"</span></span>
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Then where you want to load the view, for example, <code>didSelectRowAtIndex</code> or some <code>IBAction</code>, you need to set the property in <code>ViewControllerB</code> before you push it onto the navigation stack.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec">    ViewControllerB *viewControllerB = [[ViewControllerB alloc] initWithNib:<span class="hljs-string">@"ViewControllerB"</span> bundle:<span class="hljs-literal">nil</span>];
    viewControllerB.isSomethingEnabled = <span class="hljs-literal">YES</span>;
    [<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span> pushViewController:viewControllerB animated:<span class="hljs-literal">YES</span>];
</code></pre>
<p>This will set <code>isSomethingEnabled</code> in <code>ViewControllerB</code> to <code>BOOL</code> value <code>YES</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Passing Data Forward using Segues</strong></p>
<p>If you are using Storyboards you are most likely using segues and will need this procedure to pass data forward. This is similar to the above but instead of passing the data before you push the view controller, you use a method called</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-erlang">-<span class="hljs-params">(void)</span>prepareForSegue:<span class="hljs-params">(UIStoryboardSegue *)</span>segue sender:<span class="hljs-params">(id)</span>sender
</code></pre>
<p>So to pass a <code>BOOL</code> from <code>ViewControllerA</code> to <code>ViewControllerB</code> we would do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>in <code>ViewControllerB.h</code> create a property for the <code>BOOL</code></p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec"> <span class="hljs-keyword">@property</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">nonatomic</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">assign</span>) <span class="hljs-type">BOOL</span> isSomethingEnabled;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>in <code>ViewControllerA</code> you need to tell it about <code>ViewControllerB</code>, so use an</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"> <span class="hljs-meta">#import <span class="hljs-string">"ViewControllerB.h"</span></span>
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Create the segue from <code>ViewControllerA</code> to <code>ViewControllerB</code> on the storyboard and give it an identifier. In this example we'll call it <code>"showDetailSegue"</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>Next, we need to add the method to <code>ViewControllerA</code> that is called when any segue is performed. Because of this we need to detect which segue was called and then do something. In our example, we will check for <code>"showDetailSegue"</code> and if that's performed, we will pass our <code>BOOL</code> value to <code>ViewControllerB</code></p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec"> -(<span class="hljs-type">void</span>)prepareForSegue:(<span class="hljs-built_in">UIStoryboardSegue</span> *)segue sender:(<span class="hljs-type">id</span>)sender{
     <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>([segue.identifier isEqualToString:<span class="hljs-string">@"showDetailSegue"</span>]){
         ViewControllerB *controller = (ViewControllerB *)segue.destinationViewController;
         controller.isSomethingEnabled = <span class="hljs-literal">YES</span>;
     }
 }
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have your views embedded in a navigation controller, you need to change the method above slightly to the following</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec">    -(<span class="hljs-type">void</span>)prepareForSegue:(<span class="hljs-built_in">UIStoryboardSegue</span> *)segue sender:(<span class="hljs-type">id</span>)sender{
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>([segue.identifier isEqualToString:<span class="hljs-string">@"showDetailSegue"</span>]){
            <span class="hljs-built_in">UINavigationController</span> *navController = (<span class="hljs-built_in">UINavigationController</span> *)segue.destinationViewController;
            ViewControllerB *controller = (ViewControllerB *)navController.topViewController;
            controller.isSomethingEnabled = <span class="hljs-literal">YES</span>;
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>This will set <code>isSomethingEnabled</code> in <code>ViewControllerB</code> to <code>BOOL</code> value <code>YES</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Passing Data Back</strong></p>
<p>To pass data back from <code>ViewControllerB</code> to <code>ViewControllerA</code> you need to use <em>Protocols and Delegates</em> or <em>Blocks</em>, the latter can be used as a loosely coupled mechanism for callbacks.</p>
<p>To do this we will make <code>ViewControllerA</code> a delegate of <code>ViewControllerB</code>. This allows <code>ViewControllerB</code> to send a message back to <code>ViewControllerA</code> enabling us to send data back.</p>
<p>For <code>ViewControllerA</code> to be a delegate of <code>ViewControllerB</code> it must conform to <code>ViewControllerB</code>'s protocol which we have to specify. This tells <code>ViewControllerA</code> which methods it must implement.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In <code>ViewControllerB.h</code>, below the <code>#import</code>, but above <code>@interface</code> you specify the protocol.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-less"> <span class="hljs-variable">@class</span> ViewControllerB;

 <span class="hljs-variable">@protocol</span> ViewControllerBDelegate &lt;NSObject&gt;
 - (void)<span class="hljs-attribute">addItemViewController</span>:(ViewControllerB *)controller <span class="hljs-attribute">didFinishEnteringItem</span>:(NSString *)item;
 <span class="hljs-variable">@end</span>
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Next still in the <code>ViewControllerB.h</code>, you need to set up a <code>delegate</code> property and synthesize in <code>ViewControllerB.m</code></p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec"> <span class="hljs-keyword">@property</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">nonatomic</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">weak</span>) <span class="hljs-type">id</span> &lt;ViewControllerBDelegate&gt; delegate;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>In <code>ViewControllerB</code> we call a message on the <code>delegate</code> when we pop the view controller.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec"> <span class="hljs-built_in">NSString</span> *itemToPassBack = <span class="hljs-string">@"Pass this value back to ViewControllerA"</span>;
 [<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>.delegate addItemViewController:<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span> didFinishEnteringItem:itemToPassBack];
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>That's it for <code>ViewControllerB</code>. Now in <code>ViewControllerA.h</code>, tell <code>ViewControllerA</code> to import <code>ViewControllerB</code> and conform to its protocol.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec"> <span class="hljs-meta">#import <span class="hljs-string">"ViewControllerB.h"</span></span>

 <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">@interface</span> <span class="hljs-title">ViewControllerA</span> : <span class="hljs-title">UIViewController</span> &lt;<span class="hljs-title">ViewControllerBDelegate</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>In <code>ViewControllerA.m</code> implement the following method from our protocol</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec"> - (<span class="hljs-type">void</span>)addItemViewController:(ViewControllerB *)controller didFinishEnteringItem:(<span class="hljs-built_in">NSString</span> *)item
 {
     <span class="hljs-built_in">NSLog</span>(<span class="hljs-string">@"This was returned from ViewControllerB %@"</span>, item);
 }
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Before pushing <code>viewControllerB</code> to navigation stack we need to tell  <code>ViewControllerB</code> that <code>ViewControllerA</code> is its delegate, otherwise we will get an error.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec"> ViewControllerB *viewControllerB = [[ViewControllerB alloc] initWithNib:<span class="hljs-string">@"ViewControllerB"</span> bundle:<span class="hljs-literal">nil</span>];
 viewControllerB.delegate = <span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>
 [[<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span> navigationController] pushViewController:viewControllerB animated:<span class="hljs-literal">YES</span>];
</code></pre>

<h1>Swift</h1>
<p>There are tons and tons of explanations here and around Stack&nbsp;Overflow, but if you are a beginner just trying to get something basic to work, try watching this YouTube tutorial (It's what helped me to finally understand how to do it).</p>
<ul>
<li>YouTube tutorial: <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kpwrc1PRDsg" rel="noreferrer">How to send data through segue (Swift)</a></em></li>
</ul>
<h1>Passing data forward to the next View Controller</h1>
<p>The following is an example based on the video. The idea is to pass a string from the text field in the First View Controller to the label in the Second View Controller.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tpcnS.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/tpcnS.png" alt="Enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>Create the storyboard layout in the Interface Builder. To make the segue, you just <kbd>Control</kbd> click on the button and drag over to the Second View Controller.</p>
<p><strong>First View Controller</strong></p>
<p>The code for the First View Controller is</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-swift"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> UIKit

<span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">FirstViewController</span>: <span class="hljs-title class_">UIViewController</span> {

    <span class="hljs-keyword">@IBOutlet</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">weak</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> textField: <span class="hljs-type">UITextField</span>!

    <span class="hljs-comment">// This function is called before the segue</span>

}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Second View Controller</strong></p>
<p>And the code for the Second View Controller is</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-swift"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> UIKit

<li>Hook up the outlets for the <code>UITextField</code> and the <code>UILabel</code>.</li>

<h1>Passing data back to the previous View Controller</h1>
<p>To pass data back from the second view controller to the first view controller, you use <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/33549729/3681880">a protocol and a delegate</a>. This video is a very clear walk though of that process:</p>
<ul>
<li>YouTube tutorial: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LHDsSWc680" rel="noreferrer">iOS Swift Basics Tutorial: Protocols and Delegates</a> But also read <a href="http://krakendev.io/blog/weak-and-unowned-references-in-swift" rel="noreferrer">this post</a> to make sure you don't get into a strong reference cycle.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following is an example based on the video (with a few modifications).</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ypAga.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ypAga.png" alt="Enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>Create the storyboard layout in the Interface Builder. Again, to make the segue, you just <kbd>Control</kbd> drag from the button to the Second View Controller. Set the segue identifier to <code>showSecondViewController</code>. Also, don't forget to hook up the outlets and actions using the names in the following code.</p>

<p>The M in MVC is for "Model" and in the MVC paradigm the role of model classes is to manage a program's data. A model is the opposite of a view -- a view knows how to display data, but it knows nothing about what to do with data, whereas a model knows everything about how to work with data, but nothing about how to display it. Models can be complicated, but they don't have to be -- the model for your app might be as simple as an array of strings or dictionaries.</p>
<p>The role of a controller is to mediate between view and model. Therefore, they need a reference to one or more view objects and one or more model objects. Let's say that your model is an array of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing one row in your table. The root view for your app displays that table, and it might be responsible for loading the array from a file. When the user decides to add a new row to the table, they tap some button and your controller creates a new (mutable) dictionary and adds it to the array. In order to fill in the row, the controller creates a detail view controller and gives it the new dictionary. The detail view controller fills in the dictionary and returns. The dictionary is already part of the model, so nothing else needs to happen.</p>

<p>There are various ways by which data can be received by a different class in iOS. For example -</p>
<ol>
<li>Direct initialization after the allocation of another class.</li>
<li>Delegation - for passing data back</li>
<li>Notification - for broadcasting data to multiple classes at a single time</li>
<li>Saving in <code>NSUserDefaults</code> - for accessing it later</li>
<li>Singleton classes</li>
<li>Databases and other storage mechanisms, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_list" rel="noreferrer">p-list files</a>, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>But for the simple scenario of passing a value to a different class whose allocation is done in the current class, the most common and preferred method would be the direct setting of values after allocation. This is done as follows:</p>
<p>We can understand it using two controllers - <strong>Controller1 and Controller2</strong></p>
<p>Suppose in Controller1 class you want to create the Controller2 object and push it with a String value being passed. This can be done as this:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec">- (<span class="hljs-type">void</span>)pushToController2 {

    Controller2 *obj = [[Controller2 alloc] initWithNib:<span class="hljs-string">@"Controller2"</span> bundle:<span class="hljs-literal">nil</span>];
    [obj passValue:<span class="hljs-string">@"String"</span>];
    [<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span> pushViewController:obj animated:<span class="hljs-literal">YES</span>];
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the implementation of the Controller2 class there will be this function as:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">@interface</span> <span class="hljs-title">Controller2</span>  : <span class="hljs-title">NSObject</span></span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">@property</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">nonatomic</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">strong</span>) <span class="hljs-built_in">NSString</span>* stringPassed;

<span class="hljs-keyword">@end</span>

<span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">@implementation</span> <span class="hljs-title">Controller2</span></span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">@synthesize</span> stringPassed = _stringPassed;

- (<span class="hljs-type">void</span>) passValue:(<span class="hljs-built_in">NSString</span> *)value {

    _stringPassed = value; <span class="hljs-comment">// Or self.stringPassed = value</span>
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">@end</span>
</code></pre>
<p>You can also directly set the properties of the Controller2 class in the similar way as this:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec">- (<span class="hljs-type">void</span>)pushToController2 {

    Controller2 *obj = [[Controller2 alloc] initWithNib:<span class="hljs-string">@"Controller2"</span> bundle:<span class="hljs-literal">nil</span>];
    [obj setStringPassed:<span class="hljs-string">@"String"</span>];
    [<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span> pushViewController:obj animated:<span class="hljs-literal">YES</span>];
}
</code></pre>
<p>To pass multiple values, you can use the multiple parameters like:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash">Controller2 *obj = [[Controller2 alloc] initWithNib:@<span class="hljs-string">"Controller2"</span> bundle:nil];
[obj passValue:@String1 andValues:objArray withDate:<span class="hljs-built_in">date</span>];
</code></pre>
<p>Or if you need to pass more than three parameters which are related to a common feature, you can store the values in a model class and pass that modelObject to the next class</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp">ModelClass *modelObject = [[ModelClass alloc] <span class="hljs-keyword">init</span>];
modelObject.property1 = _property1;
modelObject.property2 = _property2;
modelObject.property3 = _property3;

Controller2 *obj = [[Controller2 alloc] initWithNib:<span class="hljs-string">@"Controller2"</span> bundle:nil];
[<span class="hljs-meta">obj passmodel: modelObject</span>];
</code></pre>
<p>So in short, if you want to -</p>
<ol>
<li>set the private variables of the second class initialise the values by calling a custom function and passing the values.</li>
<li>setProperties do it by directlyInitialising it using the setter method.</li>
<li>pass more that 3-4 values related to each other in some manner, then create a model class and set values to its object and pass the object using any of the above process.</li>
</ol>

<p>I find simplest and most elegant version with passing blocks.
Let's name view controller that waits for returned data as "A" and returning view controller as "B". In this example we want to get 2 values: first of Type1 and second of Type2.</p>
<p>Assuming we use Storyboard, first controller sets callback block, for example during segue preparation:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec">- (<span class="hljs-type">void</span>)prepareForSegue:(<span class="hljs-built_in">UIStoryboardSegue</span> *)segue sender:(<span class="hljs-type">id</span>)sender
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> ([segue.destinationViewController isKindOfClass:[BViewController <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span>]])
    {
        BViewController *viewController = segue.destinationViewController;

        viewController.callback = ^(Type1 *value1, Type2 *value2) {
            <span class="hljs-comment">// optionally, close B</span>
            <span class="hljs-comment">//[self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimated:YES];</span>

            <span class="hljs-comment">// let's do some action after with returned values</span>
            action1(value1);
            action2(value2);
        };

    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>and "B" view controller should declare callback property, BViewController.h:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">// it <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> important to use <span class="hljs-string">"copy"</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">@property (<span class="hljs-params">copy</span>) void(<span class="hljs-params">^callback</span>)(<span class="hljs-params">Type1 *value1, Type2 *value2</span>);</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Than in implementation file BViewController.m after we have desired values to return our callback should be called:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-lua"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-built_in">self</span>.callback)
    <span class="hljs-built_in">self</span>.callback(value1, value2);
</code></pre>
<p>One thing to remember is that using block often needs to manage strong and __weak references  like explained <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/cocoa/conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/WorkingwithBlocks/WorkingwithBlocks.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011210-CH8-SW16" rel="noreferrer">here</a></p>

<p>There is some good information in many of the answers given, but none address the question fully.</p>
<p>The question asks about passing information between view controllers. The specific example given asks about passing information between views, but given the self-stated newness to iOS, the original poster likely meant between viewControllers, not between views (without any involvement from the ViewControllers). It seems that all the answers focus on two view controllers, but what if the app evolves to need to involve more than two view controllers in the information exchange?</p>
<p>The original poster also asked about <strong>Singletons</strong> and the use of the <strong>AppDelegate</strong>. These questions need to be answered.</p>
<p>To help anyone else looking at this question, who wants a full answer, I'm going to attempt to provide it.</p>
<p><strong>Application Scenarios</strong></p>
<p>Rather than having a highly hypothetical, abstract discussion, it helps to have concrete applications in mind. To help define a two-view-controller situation and a more-than-two-view-controller situation, I am going to define two concrete application scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario one:</strong> maximum two view controllers ever need to share information.</p>
<p>See diagram one.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jtpRP.jpg" alt="Diagram of original problem"></p>
<p>There are two view controllers in the application. There is a ViewControllerA (Data Entry Form), and View Controller B (Product List). The items selected in the product list must match the items displayed in the text box in the data entry form. In this scenario, ViewControllerA and ViewControllerB must communicate directly with each other and no other view controllers.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario two</strong>: more than two view controllers need to share the same information.</p>
<p>See diagram two.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o0Pw4.jpg" alt="Home inventory application diagram"></p>
<p>There are four view controllers in the application. It is a tab-based application for managing home inventory. Three view controllers present differently filtered views of the same data:</p>
<ul>
<li>ViewControllerA - Luxury Items</li>
<li>ViewControllerB - Non-insured Items</li>
<li>ViewControllerC - Entire Home Inventory</li>
<li>ViewControllerD - Add New Item Form</li>
</ul>
<p>Any time an individual item is created or edited, it must also synchronize with the other view controllers. For example, if we add a boat in ViewControllerD, but it is not yet insured, then the boat must appear when the user goes to ViewControllerA (Luxury Items), and also ViewControllerC (Entire Home Inventory), but not when the user goes to ViewControllerB (Non-insured Items). We need be concerned with not only adding new items, but also deleting items (which may be allowed from any of the four view controllers), or editing existing items (which may be allowed from the "Add New Item Form", repurposing the same for editing).</p>
<p>Since all the view controllers do need to share the same data, all four view controllers need to remain in synchronization, and therefore there needs to be some sort of communication to all other view controllers, whenever any single view controller changes the underlying data. It should be fairly obvious that we do not want each view controller communicating directly with each other view controller in this scenario. In case it is not obvious, consider if we had 20 different view controllers (rather than just 4). How difficult and error-prone would it be to notify each of the other 19 view controllers any time one view controller made a change?</p>
<p><strong>The Solutions: Delegates and the Observer Pattern, and Singletons</strong></p>
<p>In scenario one, we have several viable solutions, as other answers have given</p>
<ul>
<li>segues</li>
<li>delegates</li>
<li>setting properties on view controllers directly</li>
<li>NSUserDefaults (actually a poor choice)</li>
</ul>
<p>In scenario two, we have other viable solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Observer Pattern</li>
<li>Singletons</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>singleton</strong> is an instance of a class, that instance being the only instance in existence during its lifetime. A singleton gets its name from the fact that it is the single instance. Normally developers who use singletons have special class methods for accessing them.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec">+ (HouseholdInventoryManager*) sharedManager; {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">dispatch_once_t</span> onceQueue;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> HouseholdInventoryManager* _sharedInstance;

    <span class="hljs-comment">// dispatch_once is guaranteed to only be executed</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">// once in the lifetime of the application</span>
    <span class="hljs-built_in">dispatch_once</span>(&amp;onceQueue, ^{
        _sharedInstance = [[<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span> alloc] init];
    });
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> _sharedInstance;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we understand what a singleton is, let's discuss how a singleton fits into the observer pattern. The observer pattern is used for one object to respond to changes by another object. In the second scenario, we have four different view controllers, who all want to know about changes to the underlying data. The "underlying data" should belong to a single instance, a singleton. The "know about changes" is accomplished by observing changes made to the singleton.</p>
<p>The home inventory application would have a single instance of a class which is designed to manage a list of inventory items. The manager would manage a collection of household items. The following is a class definition for the data manager:</p>

<p>When the collection of home inventory items changes, the view controllers need to be made aware of this change. The class definition above does not make it obvious how this will happen. We need to follow the observer pattern. The view controllers must formally observe the sharedManager. There are two ways to observe another object:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key-Value-Observing (KVO)</li>
<li>NSNotificationCenter.</li>
</ul>
<p>In scenario two, we do not have a single property of the HouseholdInventoryManager which could be observed using KVO. Because we do not have a single property which is easily observable, the observer pattern, in this case, must be implemented using NSNotificationCenter. Each of the four view controllers would subscribe to notifications, and the sharedManager would send notifications to the notification center when appropriate. The inventory manager does not need to know anything about the view controllers or instances of any other classes which may be interested in knowing when the collection of inventory items changes; the NSNotificationCenter takes care of these implementation details. The View Controllers simply subscribe to notifications, and the data manager simply posts notifications.</p>
<p>Many beginner programmers take advantage of the fact that there is always exactly one <strong>Application Delegate</strong> in the lifetime of the application, which is globally accessible. Beginning programmers use this fact to stuff objects and functionality into the appDelegate as a convenience for access from anywhere else in the application. Just because the AppDelegate is a singleton doesn't mean it should replace all other singletons. This is a poor practice as it places too much burden on one class, breaking good object-oriented practices. Each class should have a clear role that is easily explained, often just by the name of the class.</p>
<p>Any time your Application Delegate starts to get bloated, start to remove functionality into singletons. For example, the Core Data Stack should not be left in the AppDelegate, but should instead be put in its own class, a coreDataManager class.</p>

<p>Passing data back from ViewController 2 (destination) to viewController 1 (source) is the more interesting thing.
Assuming you use storyBoard, these are all the ways I found out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delegate</li>
<li>Notification</li>
<li>User defaults</li>
<li>Singleton</li>
</ul>
<p>Those were discussed here already.</p>
<p>I found there are more ways:</p>
<p><strong>Using Block callbacks:</strong></p>
<p>Use it in the <code>prepareForSegue</code> method in the VC1</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp">NextViewController *destinationVC = (NextViewController *) segue.destinationViewController;
[<span class="hljs-meta">destinationVC setDidFinishUsingBlockCallback:^(NextViewController *destinationVC)
{
    self.blockLabel.text = destination.blockTextField.text;
}</span>];
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Using storyboards Unwind (Exit)</strong></p>
<p>Implement a method with a UIStoryboardSegue argument in  VC 1,like this one:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-scss"><span class="hljs-built_in">-</span>(IBAction)UnWindDone:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue { }
</code></pre>
<p>In the storyBoard, hook the "return" button to the green Exit button (Unwind) of the vc. Now you have a segue that "goes back" so you can use the destinationViewController property in the prepareForSegue of VC2 and
change any property of VC1 before it goes back.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Another option of using storyboards Undwind (Exit)  - you can use the method you wrote in VC1</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec"> -(<span class="hljs-keyword">IBAction</span>)UnWindDone:(<span class="hljs-built_in">UIStoryboardSegue</span> *)segue {
     NextViewController *nextViewController = segue.sourceViewController;
     <span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>.unwindLabel.text = nextViewController.unwindPropertyPass;
 }
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And in the prepareForSegue of VC1 you can change any property you want to share.</p>
<p>In both unwind options, you can set the tag property of the button and check it in the prepareForSegue.</p>

<p>The OP didn't mention view controllers but so many of the answers do, that I wanted to chime in with what some of the new features of the LLVM allow to make this easier when wanting to pass data from one view controller to another and then getting some results back.</p>

<p>Storyboard segues, ARC and LLVM blocks make this easier than ever for me.  Some answers above mentioned storyboards and segues already but still relied on delegation.  Defining delegates certainly works but some people may find it easier to pass pointers or code blocks.</p>

<p>With UINavigators and segues, there are easy ways of passing information to the subservient controller and getting the information back.  ARC makes passing pointers to things derived from NSObjects simple so if you want the subservient controller to add/change/modify some data for you, pass it a pointer to a mutable instance.  Blocks make passing actions easy so if you want the subservient controller to invoke an action on your higher level controller, pass it a block.  You define the block to accept any number of arguments that makes sense to you.  You can also design the API to use multiple blocks if that suits things better.</p>

<p>Here are two trivial examples of the segue glue.  The first is straightforward showing one parameter passed for input, the second for output.</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec"><span class="hljs-comment">// Prepare the destination view controller by passing it the input we want it to work on</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// and the results we will look at when the user has navigated back to this controller's view.</span>

- (<span class="hljs-type">void</span>)prepareForSegue:(<span class="hljs-built_in">UIStoryboardSegue</span> *)segue sender:(<span class="hljs-type">id</span>)sender
{
    [[segue destinationViewController]

     <span class="hljs-comment">// This parameter gives the next controller the data it works on.</span>
     segueHandoffWithInput:<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>.dataForNextController

     <span class="hljs-comment">// This parameter allows the next controller to pass back results</span>
     <span class="hljs-comment">// by virtue of both controllers having a pointer to the same object.</span>
     andResults:<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>.resultsFromNextController];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This second example shows passing a callback block for the second argument.  I like using blocks because it keeps the relevant details close together in the source - the higher level source.</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec"><span class="hljs-comment">// Prepare the destination view controller by passing it the input we want it to work on</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// and the callback when it has done its work.</span>

- (<span class="hljs-type">void</span>)prepareForSegue:(<span class="hljs-built_in">UIStoryboardSegue</span> *)segue sender:(<span class="hljs-type">id</span>)sender
{
    [[segue destinationViewController]

     <span class="hljs-comment">// This parameter gives the next controller the data it works on.</span>
     segueHandoffWithInput:<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>.dataForNextController

     <span class="hljs-comment">// This parameter allows the next controller to pass back results.</span>
     resultsBlock:^(<span class="hljs-type">id</span> results) {
         <span class="hljs-comment">// This callback could be as involved as you like.</span>
         <span class="hljs-comment">// It can use Grand Central Dispatch to have work done on another thread for example.</span>
        [<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span> setResultsFromNextController:results];
    }];
}

<p>There are multiple options for <em>passing data</em> between view controllers.</p>

<p>I was searching this solution for long time, and at last I found it. First of all, declare all the objects in your SecondViewController.h file like</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-keyword">@interface</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">SecondViewController</span>: UIviewController
{
    NSMutableArray *myAray;
    CustomObject *<span class="hljs-selector-tag">object</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now in your implementation file, allocate the memory for those objects like this:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-swift"><span class="hljs-operator">-</span> (id)initWithNibName:(<span class="hljs-type">NSString</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>)nibNameOrNil bundle:(<span class="hljs-type">NSBundle</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span>)nibBundleOrNil
{
     <span class="hljs-keyword">self</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> [<span class="hljs-keyword">super</span> initWithNibName:nibNameOrNil bundle:nibBundleOrNil];
     <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>)
     {
         <span class="hljs-comment">// Custom initialization</span>
         myAray<span class="hljs-operator">=</span>[[<span class="hljs-type">NSMutableArray</span> alloc] <span class="hljs-keyword">init</span>];
         object<span class="hljs-operator">=</span>[[<span class="hljs-type">CustomObject</span> alloc] <span class="hljs-keyword">init</span>];
     }
     <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now you have allocated the memory for <code>Array</code> and object. Now you can fill that memory before pushing this <code>ViewController</code>.</p>
<p>Go to your SecondViewController.h and write two methods:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-scss"><span class="hljs-built_in">-</span>(void)setMyArray:(NSArray *)_myArray;
<span class="hljs-built_in">-</span>(void)setMyObject:(CustomObject *)_myObject;
</code></pre>
<p>In the implementation file, you can implement the function:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-scss"><span class="hljs-built_in">-</span>(void)setMyArray:(NSArray *)_myArray
{
     <span class="hljs-selector-attr">[myArra addObjectsFromArray:_myArray]</span>;
}

<span class="hljs-built_in">-</span>(void)setMyObject:(CustomObject *)_myObject
{
     <span class="hljs-selector-attr">[object setCustomObject:_myObject]</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Expecting that your <code>CustomObject</code> must have a setter function with it.</p>
<p>Now your basic work is done. Go to the place where you want to push the <code>SecondViewController</code> and do the following stuff:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-lua">SecondViewController *secondView= <span class="hljs-string">[[SecondViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"SecondViewController " bundle:[NSBundle MainBundle]]</span> ;
[secondView setMyArray:ArrayToPass];
[secondView setMyObject:objectToPass];
[<span class="hljs-built_in">self</span>.navigationController pushViewController:secondView animated:YES ];
</code></pre>

<p>This is not the way to do it. You should use delegates.</p>
<p>I'll assume we have two view controllers, ViewController1 and ViewController2, and this check thing is in the first one and when its state changes, you want to do something in ViewController2. To achieve that in the proper way, you should do the below:</p>
<p>Add a new file to your project (Objective-C Protocol) menu <em>File</em>  <em>New</em>. Now name it ViewController1Delegate or whatever you want and write these between the @interface and @end directives:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-less"><span class="hljs-variable">@optional</span>

- (void)<span class="hljs-attribute">checkStateDidChange</span>:(BOOL)checked;
</code></pre>
<p>Now go to ViewController2.h and add:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-meta">#import <span class="hljs-string">"ViewController1Delegate.h"</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>Then change its definition to:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-swift"><span class="hljs-meta">@interface</span> <span class="hljs-type">ViewController2</span>: <span class="hljs-type">UIViewController</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-type">ViewController1Delegate</span>&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now go to ViewController2.m and inside the implementation add:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec">- (<span class="hljs-type">void</span>)checkStateDidChange:(<span class="hljs-type">BOOL</span>)checked {
     <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (checked) {
           <span class="hljs-comment">// Do whatever you want here</span>
           <span class="hljs-built_in">NSLog</span>(<span class="hljs-string">@"Checked"</span>);
     }
     <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> {
           <span class="hljs-comment">// Also do whatever you want here</span>
           <span class="hljs-built_in">NSLog</span>(<span class="hljs-string">@"Not checked"</span>);
     }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now go to ViewController1.h and add the following property:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec"><span class="hljs-keyword">@property</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">weak</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">nonatomic</span>) <span class="hljs-type">id</span>&lt;ViewController1Delegate&gt; delegate;
</code></pre>
<p>Now if you are creating ViewController1 inside ViewController2 after some event, then you should do it this way using NIB files:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec">ViewController1* controller = [[<span class="hljs-built_in">NSBundle</span> mainBundle] loadNibNamed:<span class="hljs-string">@"ViewController1"</span> owner:<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span> options:<span class="hljs-literal">nil</span>][<span class="hljs-number">0</span>];
controller.delegate = <span class="hljs-keyword">self</span>;
[<span class="hljs-keyword">self</span> presentViewController:controller animated:<span class="hljs-literal">YES</span> completion:<span class="hljs-literal">nil</span>];
</code></pre>
<p>Now you are all set. Whenever you detect the event of check changed in ViewController1, all you have to do is the below:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp">[<span class="hljs-meta">delegate checkStateDidChange:checked</span>]; <span class="hljs-comment">// You pass here YES or NO based on the check state of your control</span>

<p>With a <em>Swift</em> slant and want a bare-bones example, here is my go-to method for passing data if you are using a segue to get around.</p>
<p>It is similar to the above but without the buttons, labels and such. Just simply passing data from one view to the next.</p>
<p><strong>Setup The Storyboard</strong></p>
<p>There are three parts.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Sender</li>
<li>The Segue</li>
<li>The Receiver</li>
</ol>
<p>This is a very simple view layout with a segue between them.</p>

<p><strong>The View Controllers</strong></p>
<p>We are keeping this simple so no buttons and not actions. We are simply moving data from the sender to the receiver when the application loads and then outputting the transmitted value to the console.</p>
<p>This page takes the initially loaded value and passes it along.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-swift"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> UIKit

</code></pre>
<p>This page just sends the value of the variable to the console when it loads. By this point, our favorite movie should be in that variable.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>That is how you can tackle it if you want to use a segue and you don't have your pages under a navigation controller.</p>
<p>Once it is run, it should switch to the receiver view automatically and pass the value from the sender to the receiver, displaying the value in the console.</p>

<p>I am currently contributing to an open source solution to this problem through a project called MCViewFactory, which may be found here:</p>
<p><em><a href="https://github.com/YetiHQ/manticore-iosviewfactory" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Manticore iOS View Factory</a></em></p>
<p>The idea is imitate Android's intent paradigm, using a global factory to manage which view you are looking at and using "intents" to switch and pass data between views. All the documentation is on the GitHub page, but here are some highlights:</p>
<p>You setup all your views in .XIB files and register them in the app delegate, while initializing the factory.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-dart"><span class="hljs-comment">// Register activities</span>

MCViewFactory *<span class="hljs-keyword">factory</span> = [MCViewFactory sharedFactory];

<span class="hljs-comment">// The following two lines are optional.</span>
[<span class="hljs-keyword">factory</span> registerView:@<span class="hljs-string">"YourSectionViewController"</span>];
</code></pre>
<p>Now, in your view controller (VC), anytime you want to move to a new VC and pass data, you create a new intent and add data to its dictionary (savedInstanceState). Then, just set the current intent of factory:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-csharp">MCIntent* intent = [MCIntent intentWithSectionName:<span class="hljs-string">@"YourSectionViewController"</span>];
[<span class="hljs-meta">intent setAnimationStyle:UIViewAnimationOptionTransitionFlipFromLeft</span>];
[[intent savedInstanceState] setObject:<span class="hljs-string">@"someValue"</span> forKey:<span class="hljs-string">@"yourKey"</span>];
[[intent savedInstanceState] setObject:<span class="hljs-string">@"anotherValue"</span> forKey:<span class="hljs-string">@"anotherKey"</span>];
<span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
[[MCViewModel sharedModel] setCurrentSection:intent];
</code></pre>
<p>All of your views that conform to this need to be subclasses of MCViewController, which allow you to override the new onResume: method, allowing you access to the data you've passed in.</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-objectivec">-(<span class="hljs-type">void</span>)onResume:(MCIntent *)intent {

<p>There are tons of ways to do this and it's important to pick the right one. Probably one of the biggest architectural decisions lies on how the model code will be shared or accessed throughout the app.</p>
<p>I wrote a blog post about this a while back: <a href="http://koreyhinton.com/blog/sharing-model-code.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Sharing Model Code</a>. Here's a brief summary:</p>
<h2>Shared data</h2>
<p>One approach is to share pointers to the model objects between view controllers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brute force iteration on view controllers (in Navigation or Tab Bar Controller) to set the data</li>
<li>Set data in prepareForSegue (if storyboards) or init (if programmatic)</li>
</ul>
<p>Since prepare for segue is the most common here is an example:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-swift"><span class="hljs-keyword">override</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">func</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">prepareForSegue</span>(<span class="hljs-params">segue</span>: <span class="hljs-type">UIStoryboardSegue</span>, <span class="hljs-params">sender</span>: <span class="hljs-type">AnyObject</span>?) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> next <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> segue.destinationViewController <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-type">NextViewController</span>
    next.dataSource <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> dataSource
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Independent access</h2>
<p>Another approach is to handle a screen full of data at a time and instead of coupling the view controllers to each other couple each view controller to single data source that they can get to independently.</p>
<p>The most common way I've seen this done is a <a href="http://koreyhinton.com/blog/singleton-pattern-in-swift.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">singleton</a> instance. So if your singleton object was <code>DataAccess</code> you could do the following in the viewDidLoad method of UIViewController:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">func <span class="hljs-title function_">viewDidLoad</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">super</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">viewDidLoad</span>()
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> data = dataAccess.<span class="hljs-title function_">requestData</span>()
}
</code></pre>
<p>There are addition tools that also help pass along data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key-Value Observing</li>
<li>NSNotification</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Core Data</a></li>
<li>NSFetchedResultsController</li>
<li>Data Source</li>
</ul>
<h2>Core Data</h2>
<p>The nice thing about Core Data is that it has inverse relationships. So if you want to just give a NotesViewController the notes object you can because it'll have an inverse relationship to something else like the notebook. If you need data on the notebook in the NotesViewController you can walk back up the object graph by doing the following:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-built_in">let</span> notebookName = note.notebook.name

<p>Delegation is the only one solution to perform such operations when you are using .xib files. However, all previous answers are for <code>storyboard</code> for .xibs files.  You need to use delegation. That's the only solution you can use.</p>

<p>I like the idea of <em>model</em> objects and <em>mock</em> objects based on NSProxy to commit or discard data if what the user selects can be cancelled.</p>
<p>It's easy to pass data around since it's a single object or couple of objects and if you have, let's say, a UINavigationController controller, you can keep the reference to the model inside and all pushed view controllers can access it directly from the navigation controller.</p>

<p><strong>For SwiftUI</strong></p>

<p>Think of <code>@EnvironmentObject</code> as a smarter, simpler way of using <code>@ObservedObject</code> on lots of views. Rather than creating some data in view A, then passing it to view B, then view C, then view D before finally using it, you can create it in view and put it into the environment so that views B, C, and D will automatically have access to it.</p>

<p>Note: Environment objects must be supplied by an ancestor view  if <strong>SwiftUI</strong> cant find an environment object of the correct type youll get a crash. This applies for previews too, so be careful.</p>

<p>As an example, heres an observable object that stores user settings:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-kotlin"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">UserSettings</span>: <span class="hljs-type">ObservableObject {</span></span>

is outside of the View Controller class.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;That\u0026apos;s it. Running the app now, you should be able to send data back from the second view controller to the first.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The M in MVC is for \u0026quot;Model\u0026quot; and in the MVC paradigm the role of model classes is to manage a program\u0026apos;s data. A model is the opposite of a view -- a view knows how to display data, but it knows nothing about what to do with data, whereas a model knows everything about how to work with data, but nothing about how to display it. Models can be complicated, but they don\u0026apos;t have to be -- the model for your app might be as simple as an array of strings or dictionaries.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The role of a controller is to mediate between view and model. Therefore, they need a reference to one or more view objects and one or more model objects. Let\u0026apos;s say that your model is an array of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing one row in your table. The root view for your app displays that table, and it might be responsible for loading the array from a file. When the user decides to add a new row to the table, they tap some button and your controller creates a new (mutable) dictionary and adds it to the array. In order to fill in the row, the controller creates a detail view controller and gives it the new dictionary. The detail view controller fills in the dictionary and returns. The dictionary is already part of the model, so nothing else needs to happen.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;There are various ways by which data can be received by a different class in iOS. For example -\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ol\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Direct initialization after the allocation of another class.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Delegation - for passing data back\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Notification - for broadcasting data to multiple classes at a single time\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Saving in \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;NSUserDefaults\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; - for accessing it later\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Singleton classes\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Databases and other storage mechanisms, like \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_list\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;p-list files\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, etc.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ol\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;But for the simple scenario of passing a value to a different class whose allocation is done in the current class, the most common and preferred method would be the direct setting of values after allocation.

It is a tab-based application for managing home inventory. Three view controllers present differently filtered views of the same data:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;ViewControllerA - Luxury Items\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;ViewControllerB - Non-insured Items\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;ViewControllerC - Entire Home Inventory\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;ViewControllerD - Add New Item Form\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Any time an individual item is created or edited, it must also synchronize with the other view controllers. For example, if we add a boat in ViewControllerD, but it is not yet insured, then the boat must appear when the user goes to ViewControllerA (Luxury Items), and also ViewControllerC (Entire Home Inventory), but not when the user goes to ViewControllerB (Non-insured Items). We need be concerned with not only adding new items, but also deleting items (which may be allowed from any of the four view controllers), or editing existing items (which may be allowed from the \u0026quot;Add New Item Form\u0026quot;, repurposing the same for editing).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Since all the view controllers do need to share the same data, all four view controllers need to remain in synchronization, and therefore there needs to be some sort of communication to all other view controllers, whenever any single view controller changes the underlying data. It should be fairly obvious that we do not want each view controller communicating directly with each other view controller in this scenario. In case it is not obvious, consider if we had 20 different view controllers (rather than just 4). How difficult and error-prone would it be to notify each of the other 19 view controllers any time one view controller made a change?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;The Solutions: Delegates and the Observer Pattern, and Singletons\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In scenario one, we have several viable solutions, as other answers have given\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;segues\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;delegates\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;setting properties on view controllers directly\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;NSUserDefaults (actually a poor choice)\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In scenario two, we have other viable solutions:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Observer Pattern\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Singletons\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;singleton\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; is an instance of a class, that instance being the only instance in existence during its lifetime.

The class definition above does not make it obvious how this will happen. We need to follow the observer pattern. The view controllers must formally observe the sharedManager. There are two ways to observe another object:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Key-Value-Observing (KVO)\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;NSNotificationCenter.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In scenario two, we do not have a single property of the HouseholdInventoryManager which could be observed using KVO. Because we do not have a single property which is easily observable, the observer pattern, in this case, must be implemented using NSNotificationCenter. Each of the four view controllers would subscribe to notifications, and the sharedManager would send notifications to the notification center when appropriate. The inventory manager does not need to know anything about the view controllers or instances of any other classes which may be interested in knowing when the collection of inventory items changes; the NSNotificationCenter takes care of these implementation details. The View Controllers simply subscribe to notifications, and the data manager simply posts notifications.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Many beginner programmers take advantage of the fact that there is always exactly one \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Application Delegate\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; in the lifetime of the application, which is globally accessible. Beginning programmers use this fact to stuff objects and functionality into the appDelegate as a convenience for access from anywhere else in the application. Just because the AppDelegate is a singleton doesn\u0026apos;t mean it should replace all other singletons. This is a poor practice as it places too much burden on one class, breaking good object-oriented practices. Each class should have a clear role that is easily explained, often just by the name of the class.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Any time your Application Delegate starts to get bloated, start to remove functionality into singletons. For example, the Core Data Stack should not be left in the AppDelegate, but should instead be put in its own class, a coreDataManager class.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;References\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/ManagingDataFlowBetweenViewControllers/ManagingDataFlowBetweenViewControllers.html\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;nofollow noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Managing Data Flow Between View Controllers\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1591443959382526146#editor/target=post;postID=9190043611384073352;onPublishedMenu=allposts;onClosedMenu=allposts;postNum=0;src=postname\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;nofollow noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Passing Data Between View Controllers\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1591443959382526146#editor/target=post;postID=5973873796555751994;onPublishedMenu=allposts;onClosedMenu=allposts;postNum=1;src=postname\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;nofollow noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Asynchronous JSON Requests in Objective-C\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Passing data back from ViewController 2 (destination) to viewController 1 (source) is the more interesting thing.\nAssuming you use storyBoard, these are all the ways I found out:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Delegate\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Notification\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;User defaults\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Singleton\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Those were discussed here already.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I found there are more ways:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Using Block callbacks:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Use it in the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;prepareForSegue\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; method in the VC1\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;default s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-csharp\u0026quot;\u0026gt;NextViewController *destinationVC = (NextViewController *) segue.destinationViewController;\n[\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-meta\u0026quot;\u0026gt;destinationVC setDidFinishUsingBlockCallback:^(NextViewController *destinationVC)\n{\n    self.blockLabel.text = destination.blockTextField.text;\n}\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;];\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Using storyboards Unwind (Exit)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Implement a method with a UIStoryboardSegue argument in  VC 1,like this one:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;default s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-scss\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;-\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(IBAction)UnWindDone:(UIStoryboardSegue *)segue { }\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In the storyBoard, hook the \u0026quot;return\u0026quot; button to the green Exit button (Unwind) of the vc.

Some answers above mentioned storyboards and segues already but still relied on delegation.  Defining delegates certainly works but some people may find it easier to pass pointers or code blocks.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;With UINavigators and segues, there are easy ways of passing information to the subservient controller and getting the information back.  ARC makes passing pointers to things derived from NSObjects simple so if you want the subservient controller to add/change/modify some data for you, pass it a pointer to a mutable instance.  Blocks make passing actions easy so if you want the subservient controller to invoke an action on your higher level controller, pass it a block.  You define the block to accept any number of arguments that makes sense to you.  You can also design the API to use multiple blocks if that suits things better.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Here are two trivial examples of the segue glue.
