An Integer takes up half the memory that a Long does. Now, we are talking about 2 bytes, so it&apos;s not going to make a real difference for individual integers, it&apos;s only a concern when you are dealing with TONS of integers (e.g large arrays) and memory usage is critical.\n\nBUT on a 32 bit system, the halved memory usage comes at a performance cost. When the processor actually performs some computation with a 16 bit integer (e.g. incrementing a loop counter), the value silently gets converted to a temporary Long without the benefit of the larger range of numbers to work with. Overflows still happen, and the register that the processor uses to store the values for the calculation will take the same amount of memory (32 bits) either way. Performance may even be hurt because the datatype has to be converted (at a very low level).\n\nNot the reference I was looking for but....\n\n\n  My understanding is that the underlying VB engine converts integers to long even if its declared as an integer. Therefore a slight speed decrease can be noted. I have believed this for some time and perhaps thats also why the above statement was made, I didnt ask for reasoning. \n\n\nozgrid forums\n\nThis is the reference I was looking for.\n\n\n  Short answer, in 32-bit systems 2 byte integers are converted to 4 byte\n  Longs. There really is no other way so that respective bits correctly line\n  up for any form of processing. Consider the following\n\nMsgBox Hex(-1) = Hex(65535) &apos; = True\n\n  \n  Obviously -1 does not equal 65535 yet the computer is returning the correct\n  answer, namely\n  &quot;FFFF&quot; = &quot;FFFF&quot;\n  \n  However had we coerced the -1 to a long first we would have got the right\n  answer (the 65535 being greater than 32k is automatically a long)\n\nMsgBox Hex(-1&amp;) = Hex(65535) &apos; = False\n\n  \n  &quot;FFFFFFFF&quot; = &quot;FFFF&quot;\n  \n  Generally there is no point in VBA to declare &quot;As Integer&quot; in modern\n  systems, except perhaps for some legacy API&apos;s that expect to receive an\n  Integer.\n\n\npcreview forum\n\nAnd at long last I found the msdn documentation I was really truly looking for.\n\n\n  Traditionally, VBA programmers have used integers to hold small\n  numbers, because they required less memory. In recent versions,\n  however, VBA converts all integer values to type Long, even if they&apos;re\n  declared as type Integer. So there&apos;s no longer a performance advantage\n  to using Integer variables; in fact, Long variables may be slightly\n  faster because VBA does not have to convert them.\n\n\nTo clarify based on the comments: Integers still require less memory to store - a large array of integers will need significantly less RAM than an Long array with the same dimensions. But because the processor needs to work with 32 bit chunks of memory, VBA converts Integers to Longs temporarily when it performs calculations\n\n\n\nSo, in summary, there&apos;s almost no good reason to use an Integer type these days. Unless you need to Interop with an old API call that expects a 16 bit int, or you are working with large arrays of small integers and memory is at a premium.\n\n\n  One thing worth pointing out is that some old API functions may be expecting parameters that are 16-bit (2-byte) Integers and if you are on a 32 bit and trying to pass an Integer (that is already a 4-byte long) by reference it will not work due to difference in length of bytes.\n\n\nThanks to Vba4All for pointing that out. \n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Even though this post is four years old, I was curious about this and ran some tests. The most important thing to note is that a coder should ALWAYS declare a variable as SOMETHING.

<p>So, the benefit is in reduced memory space. An Integer takes up half the memory that a Long does. Now, we are talking about 2 bytes, so it's not going to make a real difference for individual integers, it's only a concern when you are dealing with TONS of integers (e.g large arrays) and memory usage is critical.</p>

<p><strong><em>BUT</em></strong> on a <strong><em>32</em></strong> bit system, the halved memory usage comes at a performance cost. When the processor actually performs some computation with a 16 bit integer (e.g. incrementing a loop counter), the value silently gets converted to a temporary Long without the benefit of the larger range of numbers to work with. Overflows still happen, and the register that the processor uses to store the values for the calculation will take the same amount of memory (32 bits) either way. <a href="http://bytes.com/topic/access/answers/211764-looping-variables-integer-vs-long" rel="noreferrer">Performance may even be <strong><em>hurt</em></strong></a> because the datatype has to be converted (at a very low level).</p>

<p>Not the reference I was looking for but....</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My understanding is that the underlying VB engine converts integers to long even if its declared as an integer. Therefore a slight speed decrease can be noted. I have believed this for some time and perhaps thats also why the above statement was made, I didnt ask for reasoning. </p>

<p>This is the reference I was looking for.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Short answer, in 32-bit systems 2 byte integers are converted to 4 byte
  Longs. There really is no other way so that respective bits correctly line
  up for any form of processing. Consider the following</p>

<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet">MsgBox Hex(-<span class="hljs-number">1</span>) = Hex(<span class="hljs-number">65535</span>) <span class="hljs-comment">' = True</span>
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Obviously -1 does not equal 65535 yet the computer is returning the correct
  answer, namely
  "FFFF" = "FFFF"</p>
  
  <p>However had we coerced the -1 to a long first we would have got the right
  answer (the 65535 being greater than 32k is automatically a long)</p>

<pre class="lang-vb s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-vbnet">MsgBox Hex(-<span class="hljs-number">1&amp;</span>) = Hex(<span class="hljs-number">65535</span>) <span class="hljs-comment">' = False</span>
</code></pre>
  
  <p>"FFFFFFFF" = "FFFF"</p>
  
  <p>Generally there is no point in VBA to declare "As Integer" in modern
  systems, except perhaps for some legacy API's that expect to receive an
  Integer.</p>

<p>And at long last I found the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/aa164506%28v=office.10%29.aspx" rel="noreferrer">msdn documentation</a> I was really truly looking for.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Traditionally, VBA programmers have used integers to hold small
  numbers, because they required less memory. In recent versions,
  however, VBA converts all integer values to type Long, even if they're
  declared as type Integer. So there's no longer a performance advantage
  to using Integer variables; in fact, Long variables may be slightly
  faster because VBA does not have to convert them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sub>To clarify based on the comments: Integers <em>still</em> require less memory to store - a large array of integers will need significantly less RAM than an Long array with the same dimensions. But because the processor needs to work with 32 bit chunks of memory, VBA converts Integers to Longs <em>temporarily</em> when it performs calculations</sub></p>

<hr>

<p>So, in summary, there's almost no good reason to use an <code>Integer</code> type these days. <strong><em>Unless</em></strong> you need to Interop with an old API call that expects a 16 bit int, or you are working with large arrays of small integers and memory is at a premium.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One thing worth pointing out is that some old API functions may be expecting parameters that are 16-bit (2-byte) Integers and if you are on a 32 bit and trying to pass an Integer (that is already a 4-byte long) by reference it will not work due to difference in length of bytes.</p>

<p>Even though this post is four years old, I was curious about this and ran some tests. The most important thing to note is that a coder should <strong><em>ALWAYS declare a variable as SOMETHING</em></strong>. Undeclared variables clearly performed the worst (undeclared are technically <code>Variant</code>)</p>

<p><code>Long</code> did perform the fastest, so I have to think that Microsoft's recommendation to always use <code>Long</code> instead of <code>Integer</code> makes sense. I'm guessing the same as true with <code>Byte</code>, but most coders don't use this.</p>

<p>As noted in other answers, the real difference between int and long is the size of its memory space and therefore the size of the number it can hold.</p>

<p>here is the full documentation on these datatypes
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ms474284(v=office.14).aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ms474284(v=office.14).aspx</a></p>

<p>an <strong>Integer</strong> is 16 bits and can represent a value between -32,768 and 32,767</p>

<p>a <strong>Long</strong> is 32 bits and can represent -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647</p>

<p>and there is a <strong>LongLong</strong> which is 64 bits and can handle like 9 pentilion </p>

<p>One of the most important things to remember on this is that datatypes differ by both language and operating system / platform. In your world of VBA a long is 32 bits, but in c# on a 64 bit processor a long is 64 bits. This can introduce significant confusion.</p>

<p>Although VBA does not have support for it, when you move to any other language in .net or java or other, I much prefer to use the system datatypes of <strong>int16</strong>, <strong>int32</strong> and <strong>int64</strong> which allows me to b much more transparent about the values that can be held in these datatypes.</p>

<p>I have taken @PGSystemTester's method and updated it to remove some potential variability. By placing the loop in the routines, this removes the time taken to call the routine (which is a lot of time). I have also turned off screen updating to remove any delays this may cause.</p>

<p><code>Long</code> still performed the best, and as these results are more closely limited to the impacts of the variable types alone, the magnitude of variation is worth noting.</p>

<p>This is a <strong>space</strong> vs <strong>necessity</strong> problem. </p>

<p>In some situations it's a <strong>necessity</strong> to use a long. If you're looping through rows in a large excel file, the variable that holds the row number should be a long.</p>

<p>However, sometimes you will know that an integer can handle your problem and using a long would be a waste of <strong>space</strong> (memory). Individual variables really don't make much of a difference, but when you start dealing with arrays it can make a big difference. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>In VBA7, Integers are 2 bytes and longs are 4 bytes</p></li>
<li><p>If you have an array of 1 million numbers between 1 and 10, using an Integer array would take up <em>about</em> 2MB of RAM, compared to roughly 4MB of RAM for a long array.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>As others already mentioned, a <strong>Long</strong> <em>may</em> take twice as much space as an <strong>Integer</strong>. As others also already mentioned, the high capacity of current computers means you will see <strong>no difference in performance whatsoever</strong>, unless you are dealing with extra extra extra large amounts of data:</p>

<h3>Memory</h3>

<p>Considering <strong>1 million values</strong>, the difference between using Integers versus Longs would be of 2 bytes for each value, so that is 2 * 1 000 000 / 1,024 / 1024 = <strong>less than 2 MB of difference in your RAM</strong>, which is likely much less than 1% or even 0.1% of your RAM capacity.</p>

<h3>Processing</h3>

<p>Considering the benchmark done by PGSystemTester's, you can see a difference of 811 - 745 = 66 seconds between Longs and Integers, when processing 10 billion batches of 4 operations each. Reduce the number to <strong>1 million of operations</strong> and we can expect 66 / 10 000 / 4 = <strong>less than 2ms of difference in execution time</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>I personally use Integers and Longs to <strong>help readability of my code</strong>, particularly in loops, where an Integer indicates the loop is expected to be small (less than 1000 iterations), whereas a Long tells me the loop is expected to be rather large (more than 1000).</p>

<p>Note this subjective threshold is way below the Integer upper limit, I use Longs just to make the distinction between my own definitions of small and large.</p>

An Integer takes up half the memory that a Long does. Now, we are talking about 2 bytes, so it\u0026apos;s not going to make a real difference for individual integers, it\u0026apos;s only a concern when you are dealing with TONS of integers (e.g large arrays) and memory usage is critical.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;BUT\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; on a \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;32\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; bit system, the halved memory usage comes at a performance cost. When the processor actually performs some computation with a 16 bit integer (e.g. incrementing a loop counter), the value silently gets converted to a temporary Long without the benefit of the larger range of numbers to work with. Overflows still happen, and the register that the processor uses to store the values for the calculation will take the same amount of memory (32 bits) either way. \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://bytes.com/topic/access/answers/211764-looping-variables-integer-vs-long\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Performance may even be \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;hurt\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; because the datatype has to be converted (at a very low level).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Not the reference I was looking for but....\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n  \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;My understanding is that the underlying VB engine converts integers to long even if its declared as an integer.

But because the processor needs to work with 32 bit chunks of memory, VBA converts Integers to Longs \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;temporarily\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; when it performs calculations\u0026lt;/sub\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So, in summary, there\u0026apos;s almost no good reason to use an \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Integer\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; type these days. \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;Unless\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; you need to Interop with an old API call that expects a 16 bit int, or you are working with large arrays of small integers and memory is at a premium.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n  \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;One thing worth pointing out is that some old API functions may be expecting parameters that are 16-bit (2-byte) Integers and if you are on a 32 bit and trying to pass an Integer (that is already a 4-byte long) by reference it will not work due to difference in length of bytes.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Thanks to Vba4All for pointing that out. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Even though this post is four years old, I was curious about this and ran some tests. The most important thing to note is that a coder should \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;ALWAYS declare a variable as SOMETHING\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;. Undeclared variables clearly performed the worst (undeclared are technically \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Variant\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Long\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; did perform the fastest, so I have to think that Microsoft\u0026apos;s recommendation to always use \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Long\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; instead of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Integer\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; makes sense. I\u0026apos;m guessing the same as true with \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Byte\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, but most coders don\u0026apos;t use this.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;RESULTS ON 64 BIT WINDOWS 10 LAPTOP\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ptDyT.jpg\u0026quot;

which is 64 bits and can handle like 9 pentilion \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;One of the most important things to remember on this is that datatypes differ by both language and operating system / platform. In your world of VBA a long is 32 bits, but in c# on a 64 bit processor a long is 64 bits. This can introduce significant confusion.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Although VBA does not have support for it, when you move to any other language in .net or java or other, I much prefer to use the system datatypes of \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;int16\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;int32\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;int64\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; which allows me to b much more transparent about the values that can be held in these datatypes.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;VBA has a lot of historical baggage.  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;An \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Integer\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is 16 bits wide and was a good default numeric type back when 16 bit architecture/word sizes were prevalent.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Long\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is 32 bits wide and (IMO) should be used wherever possible.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I have taken @PGSystemTester\u0026apos;s method and updated it to remove some potential variability. By placing the loop in the routines, this removes the time taken to call the routine (which is a lot of time). I have also turned off screen updating to remove any delays this may cause.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Long\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; still performed the best, and as these results are more closely limited to the impacts of the variable types alone, the magnitude of variation is worth noting.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;My results (desktop, Windows 7, Excel 2010):\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/RNuDE.png\u0026quot;

Individual variables really don\u0026apos;t make much of a difference, but when you start dealing with arrays it can make a big difference. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In VBA7, Integers are 2 bytes and longs are 4 bytes\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If you have an array of 1 million numbers between 1 and 10, using an Integer array would take up \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;about\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; 2MB of RAM, compared to roughly 4MB of RAM for a long array.  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;As others already mentioned, a \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Long\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;may\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; take twice as much space as an \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Integer\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;.
