I&apos;ve changed you to just &apos;5.6&apos; so you should be good to\n  go.&quot;\n\n\nAfter that I connected my website through ftp Filezilla, also don&apos;t forget to make both your ftp service to show hidden files, and your local computer to do so, because .htaccess file was hidden in my local laptop and in my website. It was available in public_html folder, I just downloaded it and added the following codes to the end of the file and then uploaded it back to the server: \n\nphp_value memory_limit 256M\nphp_value post_max_size 256M\nphp_value upload_max_filesize 64M\nphp_value max_input_vars 1800\nphp_value max_execution_time 300\nphp_value max_input_time 300\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything is working properly for the time being, if any of you overcome with some problems please write here and warn me so that I can change the above-shown codes.

<p>I have a website hosted on a PC I have no access to. I have an upload form allowing people to upload mp3 files up to 30MB big. My server side script is done in PHP.</p>

<p>Every time I try and upload a file, I receive an error claiming that the file exceeds the maximum size allowed, so I need to increase the size. My research on the web suggested changing the <code>.htaccess</code> file which I do not have access to, so that won't work. Others suggested that I should add a custom <code>php.ini</code> file to my root which did not work. Any other suggestions?</p>

<p>You can change it via an <code>.htaccess</code> file.</p>

<p><code>.htaccess</code> files are stored in the same directory as your <code>.php</code> files are. They modify  configuration for that folder and all sub-folders. You simply use them by creating an <code>.htaccess</code> file in the directory of your choice (or modify it if present).</p>

<p>The following should enable you to increase your upload limit (if the server provider allows PHP config changes via <code>.htaccess</code>).</p>

<p>You can also use <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.ini-set.php">ini_set function</a> (only for PHP version below 5.3):</p>

<p>I have the same problem in the past .. and i fixed it through <code>.htaccess</code> file</p>

<p>When you make change on php configration through <code>.htaccess</code> you should put configrations in 
<code>IfModule</code> tag, other that the <strong>Internal server error</strong> will arise.</p>

<p>This is an example, it works fine for me:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">&lt;IfModule mod_php5.c&gt;
   php_value upload_max_filesize <span class="hljs-number">40</span>M

<p>the answers are a bit incomplete, 3 things you have to do</p>

<p>in php.ini of your php installation (note: depending if you want it for CLI, apache, or nginx, find the right php.ini to manipulate. For nginx it is usually located in <code>/etc/php/7.1/fpm</code> where 7.1 depends on your version. For apache usually <code>/etc/php/7.1/apache2</code>)</p>

<p>Perhaps this should be a comment to @seanb123 and @Fredrick Gauss commenting on his comment, but for me in Drupal 8.1 with PHP 7 the file I needed to modify was located here:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">/etc/php/<span class="hljs-number">7.0</span>/apache2/php.ini
</code></pre>

<p>I modded probably four other php.ini files, including the one my system called the "Loaded Configuration File" (<code>php -i | grep -i "loaded configuration file"</code>) and the one found on the info.php page but none of them helped. The key to discovering the correct path was found on a site from 2012. They said the path <code>"/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini"</code> was deprecated even BACK THEN but it gave me a clue where to find it. For PHP7 it's a little different than in PHP5 but the concept is the same.</p>

<p>Maybe this will help some otherwise helpless schmuck like myself.</p>

<p>That being said, the answer to the OP in my case would be that someone with admin privileges on the box would have to do it.</p>

<p>The site that helped me: <a href="http://www.evilbox.ro/linux/remove-ispconfig-maximum-upload-size-of-2m-for-wordpress/" rel="noreferrer">http://www.evilbox.ro/linux/remove-ispconfig-maximum-upload-size-of-2m-for-wordpress/</a></p>

<p>This is also addressed here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3958615/import-file-size-limit-in-phpmyadmin">Import file size limit in PHPMyAdmin</a></p>

<p>EDIT:
the full text of my note to myself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to change the max upload size, edit upload_max_filesize and
  [if needed?] post_max_size in /etc/php/7.0/apache2/php.ini (or in
  older versions: /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini )</p>
  
  <p>/etc/init.d/apache2 restart</p>
</blockquote>

<p>EDIT AGAIN:
since you're importing big files you may need to change the timeout for processing them. In my case, the file named, "config.default.php" was found at <code>/usr/share/phpmyadmin/libraries/config.default.php</code> with the variable <code>$cfg['ExecTimeLimit'] = 300;</code>
I changed mine to 900 for a huge import, for instance.
Afterward you need to restart apache</p>

<p>I had the same problem. I have tried three ways that were usually suggested:</p>

<li>functions.php</li>

<p>none if which solved my problem. I am using godaddy and came across a suggested solution which was:</p>

<li>got to <strong>Web Hosting</strong>, then <strong>Manage</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Software</strong> select <strong>Select PHP version</strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Switch to PHP Options</strong> found on the top right corner of the table in font color: blue</li>
<li>On the bottom most part, you'll probably have <code>upload_max_filesize = 2M</code></li>

<p>Well, I would like to add my 2 cents here.</p>

<p>I'm using shared webhosting and I tackled this problem many times, tried to resolve it on my own but to no avail. 
Finally I managed to resolve it through checking various web sources and contacting my hosting service provider. My questions were "How can I change php value <code>memory_limit</code> in shared webhosting?", "How can I change php value <code>upload_max_filesize</code> in shared webhosting?", "How can I change php value <code>max_input_vars</code> in shared webhosting?", "How can I change php value <code>max_execution_time</code> in shared webhosting?", "How can I change php value <code>max_input_time</code> in shared webhosting?" and many more by configuring or changing php.ini or <code>.htaccess</code> file. I tried to change them but problems arose. Finally I contacted my hosting provider, and it turns out that I set my php to native, they changed it to php 5.6, here is their answer: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Your PHP was set to 'native' mode which means you can't override
  those values. I've changed you to just '5.6' so you should be good to
  go."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After that I connected my website through ftp Filezilla, also don't forget to make both your ftp service to show hidden files, and your local computer to do so, because <code>.htaccess</code> file was hidden in my local laptop and in my website. It was available in public_html folder, I just downloaded it and added the following codes to the end of the file and then uploaded it back to the server: </p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">php_value memory_limit <span class="hljs-number">256</span>M
php_value post_max_size <span class="hljs-number">256</span>M
php_value upload_max_filesize <span class="hljs-number">64</span>M
php_value max_input_vars <span class="hljs-number">1800</span>
php_value max_execution_time <span class="hljs-number">300</span>
php_value max_input_time <span class="hljs-number">300</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Everything is working properly for the time being, if any of you overcome with some problems please write here and warn me so that I can change the above-shown codes. By the way, I also upload some pictures which shows the change. </p>

<p>One more thing I almost forgot to mention ZipArchive installation on your shared webhosting service, I managed that requirement to tick by just going to php settings through my cpanel, click on php selector extensions and then tick zip section, that's all.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>PS: I'm open to good practices, and if you see any bad practice here please let me know, I'll try to change them. Thanks.</p>

<p>Non of those solutions work for me!! (already set to 32M by default).The problem is in most case <code>max_allowed_packet</code></p>

<p>Three things you need to check.</p>

<p><code>upload_max_filesize</code>, <code>memory_limit</code> and <code>post_max_size</code> in the php.ini configuration file exactly.</p>

<p>All of these three settings limit the maximum size of data that can be submitted and handled by PHP.</p>

<p>Typically <code>post_max_size</code> and <code>memory_limit</code> need to be larger than <code>upload_max_filesize</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>So three variables <strong>total</strong> you need to check to be absolutely sure.</p>

<p>Existing answers all have partial solutions so here is the compiled answer:</p>
<p><strong>Solution 1: Edit .htaccess file</strong>
Suitable for Apache servers</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">php_value upload_max_filesize <span class="hljs-number">128</span>M
php_value post_max_size <span class="hljs-number">132</span>M

php_value max_execution_time <span class="hljs-number">300</span>
php_value max_input_time <span class="hljs-number">300</span>
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Solution 2: Edit wp-config.php file</strong>
Suitable for Wordpress application</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">@<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">ini_set</span>( <span class="hljs-string">'upload_max_filesize'</span> , <span class="hljs-string">'128M'</span> );
@<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">ini_set</span>( <span class="hljs-string">'post_max_size'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'132M'</span>);
@<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">ini_set</span>( <span class="hljs-string">'memory_limit'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'256M'</span> );
@<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">ini_set</span>( <span class="hljs-string">'max_execution_time'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'300'</span> );
@<span class="hljs-title function_ invoke__">ini_set</span>( <span class="hljs-string">'max_input_time'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'300'</span> );
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Solution 3: Edit php.ini file</strong>
Suitable for nginx servers or where php.ini is modifiable</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">upload_max_filesize = <span class="hljs-number">128</span>M
post_max_size = <span class="hljs-number">132</span>M
memory_limit = <span class="hljs-number">256</span>M
max_execution_time = <span class="hljs-number">300</span>
max_input_time = <span class="hljs-number">300</span>
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Optional: Nginx Server</strong><br>
For nginx increase maximum file upload size limit (default 1MB) by adding <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>client_max_body_size 128M;</code></a> directive in <code>http</code> or <code>server</code> block.]</p>
<h3>Important Explanation of the settings:</h3>
<ul>
<li><em>upload_max_filesize</em>  set this to a value &gt; than your file size</li>
<li><em>post_max_size</em>  set this to a value &gt; than your <em>upload_max_filesize</em> because overall size of the posted fields may be higher than the filesize</li>
<li><em>memory_limit</em>  set this to a value &gt; than your file size because it  limits the maximum amount of memory a script may consume</li>
<li><em>max_execution_time</em>  Maximum execution time of each script, in seconds. Set this to 0 (infinite) if your script requires long time to process file</li>
<li><em>max_input_time</em> - Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data. Default is 60 seconds. Set this to -1 if scripts requires more time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>And finally don't forget to restart your server.</strong> Apply below what is suitable for you:</p>
<pre class="lang-sh s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-comment"># if php-fpm is used for processing php</span>
sudo service php7.4-fpm restart

<span class="hljs-comment"># for nginx</span>
sudo service nginx restart

<p>After spending hours, I went through almost all the posts but no luck. And finally resolved the issue with these steps. This might be weird solution but worked for me.</p>
<p>Step 1: find php.ini file in /etc folder  or / folder by running below cmd:</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">grep -rl <span class="hljs-string">"post_max_size"</span> | xargs ls -lrth
</code></pre>
<p>Here I have used the post_max_size keyword to search the "php.ini" file in /etc folder ,but in some systems you can find this on /var/www/html or /var/www/wordpress folders.</p>
<p>We have multiple posts on the internet as if the php.ini file is not present in the WordPress folder then you can create but in my case that doesn't work.</p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p>Edit php.ini file and change the value like this.</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">post_max_size = <span class="hljs-number">100</span>M   
upload_max_filesize = <span class="hljs-number">100</span>M
</code></pre>
<p>In the above you can set any value as per your requirement.</p>
<p>Step 3:</p>
<p>Restart the httpd or Nginx or apache and PHP service, or as per setup, you can restart the web service.</p>
<p>For me httpd and php-fpm service restart worked in centos 8 :</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">service httpd restart
service php-fpm restart

<p><em><strong>First Option:</strong></em> Use this option in case you have permission to edit the php.ini file.</p>
<p>The <em><strong>upload_max_filesize</strong></em> and the <em><strong>post_max_size</strong></em> settings in the <strong>php.ini</strong> need to changed to support  larger files than the php default allowed size.</p>
<p>set <em><strong>upload_max_filesize</strong></em>  to the maximum size of  file which need to be uploaded.</p>
<p><em><strong>post_max_size</strong></em> should be set to greater than  <em><strong>upload_max_filesize</strong></em> to handle the  file and the size of form post variables part of file upload form.
In case multiple files are uploaded in the file upload form at a time, the <em><strong>post_max_size</strong></em> should be set to (upload_max_filesize * no of files)+ size of post variables.</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">upload_max_filesize=<span class="hljs-number">30</span>M
post_max_size=<span class="hljs-number">31</span>M
</code></pre>
<p>No need to update <em><strong>memory_limit</strong></em> and <em><strong>max_execution_time</strong></em> php settings, in case file is just moved using the move_uploaded_file to the final path in file upload php script.
But if  the file upload script is processing the file or reading the file to a variable or doing any other processing which use memory and time etc, <em><strong>memory_limit</strong></em> and <em><strong>max_execution_time</strong></em> should be set.</p>
<p>Set <em><strong>memory_limit</strong></em> to amount of memory needed for the php script to run and  <em><strong>max_execution_time</strong></em> to the time in seconds required to run the script.</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">memory_limit = <span class="hljs-number">100</span>M
max_execution_time = <span class="hljs-number">120</span>

</code></pre>
<p>Restart the webserver after the php.ini is changed for it to take effect.</p>
<p><em><strong>Second Option:</strong></em> Use this  option in case you do not have permission to update the global php.ini settings or to improve security.</p>
<p>Copy the upload php scripts to a new Child folder say "Upload" and create a file ".user.ini" in the new folder. Also make sure to update the file upload form action attribute to post to the new Script under the "Upload" Folder.</p>
<p>Add below settings to the newly created file. ".user.ini".</p>
<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">upload_max_filesize=<span class="hljs-number">30</span>M
post_max_size=<span class="hljs-number">31</span>M

;below are optional
memory_limit = <span class="hljs-number">100</span>M
max_execution_time = <span class="hljs-number">120</span>
</code></pre>
<p>"user_ini.filename"  php.ini setting can updated to give the user setting file another name.</p>
<p>This option improves the security as the <strong>upload_max_filesize, post_max_size,memory_limit, max_execution_time</strong>  are changed only for the
scripts in the new folder and  will not impact php settings for scripts in other folders and prevents any unwanted resource utilization by bad scripts.</p>
<p>Please refer below links for more information on ".user.ini" settings</p>

<p>If this option is used, not need to update the <em><strong>memory_limit</strong></em> and <em><strong>max_execution_time</strong></em> setting in the ini file.</p>
