But accidental SQL injection is more likely to result in an error than in a vulnerability.\n\nThe harmful content doesn&apos;t have to come from a user, it could be content that your application gets from any source, or even generates itself in code.\n\nHow does it cause vulnerabilities? \n\nIt can lead to vulnerabilities because attackers can send values to an application that they know will be interpolated into a SQL string.  By being very clever, they can manipulate the result of queries, reading data or even changing data that they shouldn&apos;t be allowed to do.\n\nExample in PHP:\n\n$password = $_POST[&apos;password&apos;];\n$id = $_POST[&apos;id&apos;];\n$sql = &quot;UPDATE Accounts SET PASSWORD = &apos;$password&apos; WHERE account_id = $id&quot;;\n\n\nNow suppose the attacker sets the POST request parameters to &quot;password=xyzzy&quot; and &quot;id=account_id&quot; resulting in the following SQL:\n\nUPDATE Accounts SET PASSWORD = &apos;xyzzy&apos; WHERE account_id = account_id\n\n\nAlthough I expected $id to be an integer, the attacker chose a string that is the name of the column.  Of course now the condition is true on every row, so the attacker has just set the password for every account.  Now the attacker can log in to anyone&apos;s account -- including privileged users.\n\nWhere exactly is the point where SQL is injected?\n\nIt isn&apos;t SQL that&apos;s injected, it&apos;s content that&apos;s interpolated (&quot;injected&quot;) into a SQL string, resulting in a different kind of query than I intended.  I trusted the dynamic content without verifying it, and executed the resulting SQL query blindly.  That&apos;s where the trouble starts.\n\nSQL injection is a fault in the application code, not typically in the database or in the database access library or framework.  \n\nMost cases of SQL injection can be avoided by using query parameters. See How can I prevent SQL injection in PHP? for examples.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"SQL Injection occurs when the user of an application is able to affect the meaning of database query.  This often occurs when arbitary strings from user input are concatenated to create SQL which is fed to the database.  For example lets say we had the following code (in PHP, but the same holds true for any language), which might be used to handle a user login.\n\n$sql = &quot;SELECT  FROM users WHERE username=&apos;&quot;.$_GET[&apos;username&apos;].&quot;&apos; AND password=&apos;&quot;.$_GET[&apos;password&apos;].&quot;&apos;&quot;;\n\n\nThe harm is done when the user enters something like \n\nadministrator&apos;; --\n\n\n... for the username.  Without proper encoding the query becomes:\n\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE username=&apos;administrator&apos;; -- AND password=&apos;&apos;\n\n\nThe issue here is that the &apos; in the username closes out the username field then the -- starts a SQL comment causing the database server to ignore the rest of the string.  The net result is the user can now log in as the administrator without having to know the password.  SQL Inection can also be used to execute UPDATE, DELETE or DROP queries and really damage the database.\n\nSQL Injection can be prevented by using parameterised queries, or applying your language/toolkit&apos;s escaping functions (such as mysql_real_escape_string() in PHP).\n\nOnce you understand SQL Injection you&apos;ll get the joke behind this cartoon.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"SQL injection is when things that&apos;re supposed to be data are treated as SQL code unwillingly.\n\nFor instance, if you were to do\n\nmysql_query(&quot;SELECT * FROM posts WHERE postid=$postid&quot;);\n\n\nNormally it&apos;d get you the post with a given id, but assume that $postid is set to the string 10; DROP TABLE posts --; all of a sudden, the actual query you&apos;re sending is\n\nmysql_query(&quot;SELECT * FROM posts WHERE postid=10; DROP TABLE posts --&quot;);\n\n\nThis is quite a problem, as you&apos;d be losing your entire posts table due to a malicious user - oh dear.\n\nThe easiest way to prevent this is to use prepared statements, for instance through PDO or MySQLi.\n\nThe equivalent example in PDO would then be \n\n$statement = $db-&gt;prepare(&apos;SELECT * FROM posts WHERE postid = :postid&apos;);\n$statement-&gt;bindValue(&apos;:postid&apos;, $postid);\n$statement-&gt;execute();\n\n\nDoing this ensures that the database system knows that $postid is to be treated as data and not code, and will thus be handled appropriately.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"This question has been answered many times on StackOverflow, but it&apos;s an important topic for everyone to know about, so I&apos;m not going to vote to close this question.\n\nHere are links to some of my past answers on this topic:\n\n\nWhat is SQL Injection?\nHow do I protect this function from SQL injection?\nAre Parameters really enough to prevent Sql injections?\nIs SQL injection a risk today?\n\n\nI also gave a presentation at the MySQL Conference this month, and my slides are online:\n\n\nSQL Injection Myths &amp; Fallacies\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"SQL injection is where a malicious user will put SQL into input fields to try and run the SQL on your server.\n\nThe #1 advice that I adhere to is to use parameterized stored procedures rather than building raw SQL in code.\n\nStored Procedure parameters don&apos;t get executed, making them safe in most cases.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I found this paper to be an extremely good read about SQL injection techniques (link is to PDF): Advanced SQL Injection In SQL Server Applications.\n\nDespite the title saying &quot;Advanced&quot;, it&apos;s quite readable even if you don&apos;t have much knowledge about SQL injection.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution6","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"To get some general background check out the Wikipedia article on SQL Injection.\n\nIn short SQL injection attacks can leave you vulnerable to all manor of database data theft and destruction.

$id <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> $_POST[<span class="hljs-string">'id'</span>];
$<span class="hljs-keyword">sql</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> "UPDATE Accounts SET PASSWORD = '$password' WHERE account_id = $id";
</code></pre>

<p>Now suppose the attacker sets the POST request parameters to "<code>password=xyzzy</code>" and "<code>id=account_id</code>" resulting in the following SQL:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">UPDATE</span> Accounts <span class="hljs-keyword">SET</span> PASSWORD <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-string">'xyzzy'</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> account_id <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> account_id
</code></pre>

<p>Although I expected <code>$id</code> to be an integer, the attacker chose a string that is the name of the column.  Of course now the condition is true on <em>every</em> row, so the attacker has just set the password for <em>every</em> account.  Now the attacker can log in to anyone's account -- including privileged users.</p>

<p><strong>Where exactly is the point where SQL is injected?</strong></p>

<p>It isn't SQL that's injected, it's content that's interpolated ("injected") into a SQL string, resulting in a different kind of query than I intended.  I trusted the dynamic content without verifying it, and executed the resulting SQL query blindly.  That's where the trouble starts.</p>

<p>SQL injection is a fault in the application code, not typically in the database or in the database access library or framework.  </p>

<p>Most cases of SQL injection can be avoided by using query parameters. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60174/how-can-i-prevent-sql-injection-in-php">How can I prevent SQL injection in PHP?</a> for examples.</p>

<p>SQL Injection occurs when the user of an application is able to affect the meaning of database query.  This often occurs when arbitary strings from user input are concatenated to create SQL which is fed to the database.  For example lets say we had the following code (in PHP, but the same holds true for any language), which might be used to handle a user login.</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">$<span class="hljs-keyword">sql</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> "SELECT  FROM users WHERE username='".$_GET[<span class="hljs-string">'username'</span>]."' AND password='".$_GET[<span class="hljs-string">'password'</span>]."'";
</code></pre>

<p>The harm is done when the user enters something like </p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">administrator<span class="hljs-string">'; --
</span></code></pre>

<p>... for the username.  Without proper encoding the query becomes:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql"><span class="hljs-keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="hljs-operator">*</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">FROM</span> users <span class="hljs-keyword">WHERE</span> username<span class="hljs-operator">=</span><span class="hljs-string">'administrator'</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">-- AND password=''</span>
</code></pre>

<p>The issue here is that the ' in the username closes out the username field then the -- starts a SQL comment causing the database server to ignore the rest of the string.  The net result is the user can now log in as the administrator without having to know the password.  SQL Inection can also be used to execute UPDATE, DELETE or DROP queries and really damage the database.</p>

<p>SQL Injection can be prevented by using parameterised queries, or applying your language/toolkit's escaping functions (such as mysql_real_escape_string() in PHP).</p>

<p>Once you understand SQL Injection you'll get the joke behind <a href="http://xkcd.com/327/" rel="noreferrer">this cartoon</a>.</p>

<p>SQL injection is when things that're supposed to be data are treated as SQL code unwillingly.</p>

<p>For instance, if you were to do</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">mysql_query("SELECT * FROM posts WHERE postid=$postid");
</code></pre>

<p>Normally it'd get you the post with a given id, but assume that <code>$postid</code> is set to the string <code>10; DROP TABLE posts --</code>; all of a sudden, the actual query you're sending is</p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">mysql_query("SELECT * FROM posts WHERE postid=10; DROP TABLE posts --");
</code></pre>

<p>This is quite a problem, as you'd be losing your entire posts table due to a malicious user - oh dear.</p>

<p>The easiest way to prevent this is to use prepared statements, for instance through <a href="http://dk2.php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepare.php" rel="noreferrer">PDO</a> or <a href="http://dk2.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.prepare.php" rel="noreferrer">MySQLi</a>.</p>

<p>The equivalent example in PDO would then be </p>

<pre class="lang-sql s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-sql">$statement <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> $db<span class="hljs-operator">-</span><span class="hljs-operator">&gt;</span><span class="hljs-keyword">prepare</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'SELECT * FROM posts WHERE postid = :postid'</span>);
$statement<span class="hljs-operator">-</span><span class="hljs-operator">&gt;</span>bindValue(<span class="hljs-string">':postid'</span>, $postid);
$statement<span class="hljs-operator">-</span><span class="hljs-operator">&gt;</span><span class="hljs-keyword">execute</span>();
</code></pre>

<p>Doing this ensures that the database system knows that $postid is to be treated as data and not code, and will thus be handled appropriately.</p>

<p>SQL injection is where a malicious user will put SQL into input fields to try and run the SQL on your server.</p>

<p>The #1 advice that I adhere to is to use parameterized stored procedures rather than building raw SQL in code.</p>

<p>Stored Procedure parameters don't get executed, making them safe in most cases.</p>

<p>In short SQL injection attacks can leave you vulnerable to all manor of database data theft and destruction.  The exact details of what can be done to your system depend on the details of the system itself.</p>

<p>Any time you pass input from your users to your database you have a potential injection point.  Web applications are often lacking in the this regard, as new programmers often do not understand the risks of handling input from users, and web applications are attacked by very smart people you never thought would find your program.</p>

<p>The point where SQL is injected is any point that your application accepts input from the user.</p>

<p>Whether this becomes a dangerous vulnerability for your web application depends on whether this input is later used as part of an SQL query without properly checking its type and escaping it if necessary.</p>

<p>Without proper escaping, some SQL code 'injected' by the user could be executed by the SQL engine as SQL code, rather than a simple string or value.</p>
