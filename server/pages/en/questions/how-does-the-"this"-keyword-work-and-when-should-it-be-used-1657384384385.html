Its main use is in functions and constructors.\nThe rules for this are quite simple (if you stick to best practices).\nTechnical description of this in the specification\nThe ECMAScript standard defines this via the abstract operation (abbreviated AO) ResolveThisBinding:\n\nThe [AO] ResolveThisBinding [] determines the binding of the keyword this using the LexicalEnvironment of the running execution context. [Steps]:\n\nLet envRec be GetThisEnvironment().\nReturn ? envRec.GetThisBinding().\n\n\nGlobal Environment Records, module Environment Records, and function Environment Records each have their own GetThisBinding method.\nThe GetThisEnvironment AO finds the current running execution contexts LexicalEnvironment and finds the closest ascendant Environment Record (by iteratively accessing their [[OuterEnv]] properties) which has a this binding (i.e. HasThisBinding returns true). This process ends in one of the three Environment Record types.\nThe value of this often depends on whether code is in strict mode.\nThe return value of GetThisBinding reflects the value of this of the current execution context, so whenever a new execution context is established, this resolves to a distinct value. This can also happen when the current execution context is modified. The following subsections list the five cases where this can happen.\nYou can put the code samples in the AST explorer to follow along with specification details.\n1. Global execution context in scripts\nThis is script code evaluated at the top level, e.g. directly inside a &lt;script&gt;:\n&lt;script&gt;\n// Global context\nconsole.log(this); // Logs global object.\n\nsetTimeout(function(){\n  console.log(&quot;Not global context&quot;);\n});\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\nWhen in the initial global execution context of a script, evaluating this causes GetThisBinding to take the following steps:\n\nThe GetThisBinding concrete method of a global Environment Record envRec [] [does this]:\n\nReturn envRec.[[GlobalThisValue]].\n\n\nThe [[GlobalThisValue]] property of a global Environment Record is always set to the host-defined global object, which is reachable via globalThis (window on Web, global on Node.js; Docs on MDN). Follow the steps of InitializeHostDefinedRealm to learn how the [[GlobalThisValue]] property comes to be.\n2. Global execution context in modules\nModules have been introduced in ECMAScript 2015.\nThis applies to modules, e.g. when directly inside a &lt;script type=&quot;module&quot;&gt;, as opposed to a simple &lt;script&gt;.\nWhen in the initial global execution context of a module, evaluating this causes GetThisBinding to take the following steps:\n\nThe GetThisBinding concrete method of a module Environment Record [] [does this]:\n\nReturn undefined.\n\n\nIn modules, the value of this is always undefined in the global context. Modules are implicitly in strict mode.\n3. Entering eval code\nThere are two kinds of eval calls: direct and indirect. This distinction exists since the ECMAScript 5th edition.\n\nA direct eval call usually looks like eval(); or (eval)(); (or ((eval))();, etc.).1 Its only direct if the call expression fits a narrow pattern.2\nAn indirect eval call involves calling the function reference eval in any other way. It could be eval?.(), (, eval)(), window.eval(), eval.call(,), etc. Given const aliasEval1 = eval; window.aliasEval2 = eval;, it would also be aliasEval1(), aliasEval2(). Separately, given const originalEval = eval; window.eval = (x) =&gt; originalEval(x);, calling eval() would also be indirect.\n\nSee chuckjs answer to (1, eval)(&apos;this&apos;) vs eval(&apos;this&apos;) in JavaScript? and Dmitry Soshnikovs ECMA-262-5 in detail  Chapter 2: Strict Mode (archived) for when you might use an indirect eval() call.\nPerformEval executes the eval code. It creates a new declarative Environment Record as its LexicalEnvironment, which is where GetThisEnvironment gets the this value from.\nThen, if this appears in eval code, the GetThisBinding method of the Environment Record found by GetThisEnvironment is called and its value returned.\nAnd the created declarative Environment Record depends on whether the eval call was direct or indirect:\n\nIn a direct eval, it will be based on the current running execution contexts LexicalEnvironment.\nIn an indirect eval, it will be based on the [[GlobalEnv]] property (a global Environment Record) of the Realm Record which executed the indirect eval.\n\nWhich means:\n\nIn a direct eval, the this value doesnt change; its taken from the lexical scope that called eval.\nIn an indirect eval, the this value is the global object (globalThis).\n\nWhat about new Function?new Function is similar to eval, but it doesnt call the code immediately; it creates a function. A this binding doesnt apply anywhere here, except when the function is called, which works normally, as explained in the next subsection.\n4. Entering function code\nEntering function code occurs when calling a function.\nThere are four categories of syntax to invoke a function.\n\nThe EvaluateCall AO is performed for these three:3\n\nNormal function calls\nOptional chaining calls\nTagged templates\n\n\nAnd EvaluateNew is performed for this one:3\n\nConstructor invocations\n\n\n\nThe actual function call happens at the Call AO, which is called with a thisValue determined from context; this argument is passed along in a long chain of call-related calls. Call calls the [[Call]] internal slot of the function. This calls PrepareForOrdinaryCall where a new function Environment Record is created:\n\nA function Environment Record is a declarative Environment Record that is used to represent the top-level scope of a function and, if the function is not an ArrowFunction, provides a this binding. If a function is not an ArrowFunction function and references super, its function Environment Record also contains the state that is used to perform super method invocations from within the function.\n\nIn addition, there is the [[ThisValue]] field in a function Environment Record:\n\nThis is the this value used for this invocation of the function.\n\nThe NewFunctionEnvironment call also sets the function environments [[ThisBindingStatus]] property.\n[[Call]] also calls OrdinaryCallBindThis, where the appropriate thisArgument is determined based on:\n\nthe original reference,\nthe kind of the function, and\nwhether or not the code is in strict mode.\n\nOnce determined, a final call to the BindThisValue method of the newly created function Environment Record actually sets the [[ThisValue]] field to the thisArgument.\nFinally, this very field is where a function Environment Records GetThisBinding AO gets the value for this from:\n\nThe GetThisBinding concrete method of a function Environment Record envRec [] [does this]:\n[]\n3. Return envRec.[[ThisValue]].\n\nAgain, how exactly the this value is determined depends on many factors; this was just a general overview. With this technical background, lets examine all the concrete examples.\nArrow functions\nWhen an arrow function is evaluated, the [[ThisMode]] internal slot of the function object is set to lexical in OrdinaryFunctionCreate.\nAt OrdinaryCallBindThis, which takes a function F:\n\n\nLet thisMode be F.[[ThisMode]].\nIf thisMode is lexical, return NormalCompletion(undefined).\n[]\n\n\nwhich just means that the rest of the algorithm which binds this is skipped. An arrow function does not bind its own this value.\nSo, what is this inside an arrow function, then? Looking back at ResolveThisBinding and GetThisEnvironment, the HasThisBinding method explicitly returns false.\n\nThe HasThisBinding concrete method of a function Environment Record envRec [] [does this]:\n\nIf envRec.[[ThisBindingStatus]] is lexical, return false; otherwise, return true.\n\n\nSo the outer environment is looked up instead, iteratively. The process will end in one of the three environments that have a this binding.\nThis just means that, in arrow function bodies, this comes from the lexical scope of the arrow function, or in other words (from Arrow function vs function declaration / expressions: Are they equivalent / exchangeable?):\n\nArrow functions dont have their own this [] binding. Instead, [this identifier is] resolved in the lexical scope like any other variable. That means that inside an arrow function, this [refers] to the [value of this] in the environment the arrow function is defined in (i.e. outside the arrow function).\n\nFunction properties\nIn normal functions (function, methods), this is determined by how the function is called.\nThis is where these syntax variants come in handy.\nConsider this object containing a function:\nconst refObj = {\n    func: function(){\n      console.log(this);\n    }\n  };\n\nAlternatively:\nconst refObj = {\n    func(){\n      console.log(this);\n    }\n  };\n\nIn any of the following function calls, the this value inside func will be refObj.1\n\nrefObj.func()\nrefObj[&quot;func&quot;]()\nrefObj?.func()\nrefObj.func?.()\nrefObj.func``\n\nIf the called function is syntactically a property of a base object, then this base will be the reference of the call, which, in usual cases, will be the value of this. This is explained by the evaluation steps linked above; for example, in refObj.func() (or refObj[&quot;func&quot;]()), the CallMemberExpression is the entire expression refObj.func(), which consists of the MemberExpression refObj.func and the Arguments ().\nBut also, refObj.func and refObj play three roles, each:\n\ntheyre both expressions,\ntheyre both references, and\ntheyre both values.\n\nrefObj.func as a value is the callable function object; the corresponding reference is used to determine the this binding.\nThe optional chaining and tagged template examples work very similarly: basically, the reference is everything before the ?.(), before the ``, or before the ().\nEvaluateCall uses IsPropertyReference of that reference to determine if it is a property of an object, syntactically. Its trying to get the [[Base]] property of the reference (which is e.g. refObj, when applied to refObj.func; or foo.bar when applied to foo.bar.baz). If it is written as a property, then GetThisValue will get this [[Base]] property and use it as the this value.\nNote: Getters / Setters work the same way as methods, regarding this. Simple properties dont affect the execution context, e.g. here, this is in global scope:\nconst o = {\n    a: 1,\n    b: this.a, // Is `globalThis.a`.\n    [this.a]: 2 // Refers to `globalThis.a`.\n  };\n\nCalls without base reference, strict mode, and with\nA call without a base reference is usually a function that isnt called as a property. For example:\nfunc(); // As opposed to `refObj.func();`.\n\nThis also happens when passing or assigning methods, or using the comma operator. This is where the difference between Reference Record and Value is relevant.\nNote function j: following the specification, you will notice that j can only return the function object (Value) itself, but not a Reference Record. Therefore the base reference refObj is lost.\nconst g = (f) =&gt; f(); // No base ref.\nconst h = refObj.func;\nconst j = () =&gt; refObj.func;\n\ng(refObj.func);\nh(); // No base ref.\nj()(); // No base ref.\n(0, refObj.func)(); // Another common pattern to remove the base ref.\n\nEvaluateCall calls Call with a thisValue of undefined here. This makes a difference in OrdinaryCallBindThis (F: the function object; thisArgument: the thisValue passed to Call):\n\n\nLet thisMode be F.[[ThisMode]].\n\n[]\n\nIf thisMode is strict, let thisValue be thisArgument.\nElse,\n\nIf thisArgument is undefined or null, then\n\nLet globalEnv be calleeRealm.[[GlobalEnv]].\n[]\nLet thisValue be globalEnv.[[GlobalThisValue]].\n\n\nElse,\n\nLet thisValue be ! ToObject(thisArgument).\nNOTE: ToObject produces wrapper objects [].\n\n\n\n\n\n[]\n\nNote: step 5 sets the actual value of this to the supplied thisArgument in strict modeundefined in this case. In sloppy mode, an undefined or null thisArgument results in this being the global this value.\nIf IsPropertyReference returns false, then EvaluateCall takes these steps:\n\n\nLet refEnv be ref.[[Base]].\nAssert: refEnv is an Environment Record.\nLet thisValue be refEnv.WithBaseObject().\n\n\nThis is where an undefined thisValue may come from: refEnv.WithBaseObject() is always undefined, except in with statements. In this case, thisValue will be the binding object.\nTheres also Symbol.unscopables (Docs on MDN) to control the with binding behavior.\nTo summarize, so far:\nfunction f1(){\n  console.log(this);\n}\n\nfunction f2(){\n  console.log(this);\n}\n\nfunction f3(){\n  console.log(this);\n}\n\nconst o = {\n    f1,\n    f2,\n    [Symbol.unscopables]: {\n      f2: true\n    }\n  };\n\nf1(); // Logs `globalThis`.\n\nwith(o){\n  f1(); // Logs `o`.\n  f2(); // `f2` is unscopable, so this logs `globalThis`.\n  f3(); // `f3` is not on `o`, so this logs `globalThis`.\n}\n\nand:\n&quot;use strict&quot;;\n\nfunction f(){\n  console.log(this);\n}\n\nf(); // Logs `undefined`.\n\n// `with` statements are not allowed in strict-mode code.\n\nNote that when evaluating this, it doesnt matter where a normal function is defined.\n.call, .apply, .bind, thisArg, and primitives\nAnother consequence of step 5 of OrdinaryCallBindThis, in conjunction with step 6.2 (6.b in the spec), is that a primitive this value is coerced to an object only in sloppy mode.\nTo examine this, lets introduce another source for the this value: the three methods that override the this binding:4\n\nFunction.prototype.apply(thisArg, argArray)\nFunction.prototype. {call, bind} (thisArg, ...args)\n\n.bind creates a bound function, whose this binding is set to thisArg and cannot change again. .call and .apply call the function immediately, with the this binding set to thisArg.\n.call and .apply map directly to Call, using the specified thisArg. .bind creates a bound function with BoundFunctionCreate. These have their own [[Call]] method which looks up the function objects [[BoundThis]] internal slot.\nExamples of setting a custom this value:\nfunction f(){\n  console.log(this);\n}\n\nconst myObj = {},\n  g = f.bind(myObj),\n  h = (m) =&gt; m();\n\n// All of these log `myObj`.\ng();\nf.bind(myObj)();\nf.call(myObj);\nh(g);\n\nFor objects, this is the same in strict and non-strict mode.\nNow, try to supply a primitive value:\nfunction f(){\n  console.log(this);\n}\n\nconst myString = &quot;s&quot;,\n  g = f.bind(myString);\n\ng();              // Logs `String { &quot;s&quot; }`.\nf.call(myString); // Logs `String { &quot;s&quot; }`.\n\nIn non-strict mode, primitives are coerced to their object-wrapped form. Its the same kind of object you get when calling Object(&quot;s&quot;) or new String(&quot;s&quot;). In strict mode, you can use primitives:\n&quot;use strict&quot;;\n\nfunction f(){\n  console.log(this);\n}\n\nconst myString = &quot;s&quot;,\n  g = f.bind(myString);\n\ng();              // Logs `&quot;s&quot;`.\nf.call(myString); // Logs `&quot;s&quot;`.\n\nLibraries make use of these methods, e.g. jQuery sets the this to the DOM element selected here:\n$(&quot;button&quot;).click(function(){\n  console.log(this); // Logs the clicked button.\n});\n\nConstructors, classes, and new\nWhen calling a function as a constructor using the new operator, EvaluateNew calls Construct, which calls the [[Construct]] method. If the function is a base constructor (i.e. not a class extends{}), it sets thisArgument to a new object created from the constructors prototype. Properties set on this in the constructor will end up on the resulting instance object. this is implicitly returned, unless you explicitly return your own non-primitive value.\nA class is a new way of creating constructor functions, introduced in ECMAScript 2015.\nfunction Old(a){\n  this.p = a;\n}\n\nconst o = new Old(1);\n\nconsole.log(o);  // Logs `Old { p: 1 }`.\n\nclass New{\n  constructor(a){\n    this.p = a;\n  }\n}\n\nconst n = new New(1);\n\nconsole.log(n); // Logs `New { p: 1 }`.\n\nClass definitions are implicitly in strict mode:\nclass A{\n  m1(){\n    return this;\n  }\n  m2(){\n    const m1 = this.m1;\n    \n    console.log(m1());\n  }\n}\n\nnew A().m2(); // Logs `undefined`.\n\nsuper\nThe exception to the behavior with new is class extends{}, as mentioned above. Derived classes do not immediately set their this value upon invocation; they only do so once the base class is reached through a series of super calls (happens implicitly without an own constructor). Using this before calling super is not allowed.\nCalling super calls the super constructor with the this value of the lexical scope (the function Environment Record) of the call. GetThisValue has a special rule for super calls. It uses BindThisValue to set this to that Environment Record.\nclass DerivedNew extends New{\n  constructor(a, a2){\n    // Using `this` before `super` results in a ReferenceError.\n    super(a);\n    this.p2 = a2;\n  }\n}\n\nconst n2 = new DerivedNew(1, 2);\n\nconsole.log(n2); // Logs `DerivedNew { p: 1, p2: 2 }`.\n\n5. Evaluating class fields\nInstance fields and static fields were introduced in ECMAScript 2022.\nWhen a class is evaluated, ClassDefinitionEvaluation is performed, modifying the running execution context. For each ClassElement:\n\nif a field is static, then this refers to the class itself,\nif a field is not static, then this refers to the instance.\n\nPrivate fields (e.g. #x) and methods are added to a PrivateEnvironment.\nStatic blocks are currently a TC39 stage 3 proposal. Static blocks work the same as static fields and methods: this inside them refers to the class itself.\nNote that in methods and getters / setters, this works just like in normal function properties.\nclass Demo{\n  a = this;\n  b(){\n    return this;\n  }\n  static c = this;\n  static d(){\n    return this;\n  }\n  // Getters, setters, private modifiers are also possible.\n}\n\nconst demo = new Demo;\n\nconsole.log(demo.a, demo.b()); // Both log `demo`.\nconsole.log(Demo.c, Demo.d()); // Both log `Demo`.\n\n\n1: (o.f)() is equivalent to o.f(); (f)() is equivalent to f(). This is explained in this 2ality article (archived). Particularly see how a ParenthesizedExpression is evaluated.\n2: It must be a MemberExpression, must not be a property, must have a [[ReferencedName]] of exactly &quot;eval&quot;, and must be the %eval% intrinsic object.\n3: Whenever the specification says Let ref be the result of evaluating X., then X is some expression that you need to find the evaluation steps for. For example, evaluating a MemberExpression or CallExpression is the result of one of these algorithms. Some of them result in a Reference Record.\n4: There are also several other native and host methods that allow providing a this value, notably Array.prototype.map, Array.prototype.forEach, etc. that accept a thisArg as their second argument. Anyone can make their own methods to alter this like (func, thisArg) =&gt; func.bind(thisArg), (func, thisArg) =&gt; func.call(thisArg), etc. As always, MDN offers great documentation.\n\nJust for fun, test your understanding with some examples\nFor each code snippet, answer the question: What is the value of this at the marked line? Why?.\nTo reveal the answers, click the gray boxes.\n\n\nif(true){\n  console.log(this); // What is `this` here?\n}\n\n\n globalThis. The marked line is evaluated in the initial global execution context.\n\n\n\n\nconst obj = {};\n\nfunction myFun(){\n  return { // What is `this` here?\n    &quot;is obj&quot;: this === obj,\n    &quot;is globalThis&quot;: this === globalThis\n  };\n}\n\nobj.method = myFun;\n\nconsole.log(obj.method());\n\n   \n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\n obj. When calling a function as a property of an object, it is called with the this binding set to the base of the reference obj.method, i.e. obj.\n\n\n\n\nconst obj = {\n    myMethod: function(){\n      return { // What is `this` here?\n        &quot;is obj&quot;: this === obj,\n        &quot;is globalThis&quot;: this === globalThis\n      };\n    }\n  },\n  myFun = obj.myMethod;\n\nconsole.log(myFun());\n\n   \n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\n globalThis. Since the function value myFun / obj.myMethod is not called off of an object, as a property, the this binding will be globalThis.\n\n This is different from Python, in which accessing a method (obj.myMethod) creates a bound method object.\n\n\n\n\nconst obj = {\n    myFun: () =&gt; ({ // What is `this` here?\n      &quot;is obj&quot;: this === obj,\n      &quot;is globalThis&quot;: this === globalThis\n    })\n  };\n\nconsole.log(obj.myFun());\n\n   \n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\n globalThis. Arrow functions dont create their own this binding. The lexical scope is the same as the initial global scope, so this is globalThis.\n\n\n\nfunction myFun(){\n  console.log(this); // What is `this` here?\n}\n\nconst obj = {\n    myMethod: function(){\n      eval(&quot;myFun()&quot;);\n    }\n  };\n\nobj.myMethod();\n\n\n globalThis. When evaluating the direct eval call, this is obj. However, in the eval code, myFun is not called off of an object, so the this binding is set to the global object.\n\n\n\n\nfunction myFun() {\n  // What is `this` here?\n  return {\n    &quot;is obj&quot;: this === obj,\n    &quot;is globalThis&quot;: this === globalThis\n  };\n}\n\nconst obj = {};\n\nconsole.log(myFun.call(obj));\n\n   \n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\n obj. The line myFun.call(obj); is invoking the special built-in function Function.prototype.call, which accepts thisArg as the first argument.\n\n\n\n\nclass MyCls{\n  arrow = () =&gt; ({ // What is `this` here?\n    &quot;is MyCls&quot;: this === MyCls,\n    &quot;is globalThis&quot;: this === globalThis,\n    &quot;is instance&quot;: this instanceof MyCls\n  });\n}\n\nconsole.log(new MyCls().arrow());\n\n   \n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\n Its the instance of MyCls. Arrow functions dont change the this binding, so it comes from lexical scope. Therefore, this is exactly the same as with the class fields mentioned above, like a = this;. Try changing it to static arrow. Do you get the result you expect?\n\n\n\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/how-does-the-&quot;this&quot;-keyword-work-and-when-should-it-be-used-1657384384385#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"The this keyword behaves differently in JavaScript compared to other languages.

With function we may need to first create its instance using new operator.\nAlso in an object literal approach, we can explicitly add members to already defined object using dot operator. This gets added to the specific instance only. However I have added variable to the function prototype so that it gets reflected in all instances of the function.\n\n\nBelow I tried out all the things that we did with Object and this above, but by first creating function instead of directly writing an object.\n\n/********************************************************************* \n  1.

When used inside function defined on prototype chain\n\nIf the method is on an object&apos;s prototype chain, this inside such method refers to the object the method was called on, as if the method is defined on the object.\n\nvar ProtoObj = {\n    fun: function () {\n        return this.a;\n    }\n};\n//Object.create() creates object with ProtoObj as its\n//prototype and assigns it to obj3, thus making fun() \n//to be the method on its prototype chain\n\nvar obj3 = Object.create(ProtoObj);\nobj3.a = 999;\ndocument.write(obj3.fun()); //999\n\n//Notice that fun() is defined on obj3&apos;s prototype but \n//`this.a` inside fun() retrieves obj3.a   \n\n\n6. Inside call(), apply() and bind() functions\n\n\nAll these methods are defined on Function.prototype.\nThese methods allows to write a function once and invoke it in different context. In other words, they allows to specify the value of this which will be used while the function is being executed. They also take any parameters to be passed to the original function when it is invoked.\nfun.apply(obj1 [, argsArray]) Sets obj1 as the value of this inside fun() and calls fun() passing elements of argsArray as its arguments.\nfun.call(obj1 [, arg1 [, arg2 [,arg3 [, ...]]]]) - Sets obj1 as the value of this inside fun() and calls fun() passing arg1, arg2, arg3, ... as its arguments.\nfun.bind(obj1 [, arg1 [, arg2 [,arg3 [, ...]]]]) - Returns the reference to the function fun with this inside fun bound to obj1 and parameters of fun bound to the   parameters specified arg1, arg2, arg3,....\nBy now the difference between apply, call and bind must have become apparent. apply allows to specify the arguments to function as array-like object i.e. an object with a numeric length property and corresponding non-negative integer properties. Whereas call allows to specify the arguments to the function directly. Both apply and call immediately invokes the function in the specified context and with the specified arguments. On the other hand, bind simply returns the function bound to the specified this value and the arguments. We can capture the reference to this returned function by assigning it to a variable and later we can call it any time.\n\n\n\n\nfunction add(inc1, inc2)\n{\n    return this.a + inc1 + inc2;\n}\n\nvar o = { a : 4 };\ndocument.write(add.call(o, 5, 6)+&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;); //15\n      //above add.call(o,5,6) sets `this` inside\n      //add() to `o` and calls add() resulting:\n      // this.a + inc1 + inc2 = \n      // `o.a` i.e. 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\ndocument.write(add.apply(o, [5, 6]) + &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;); //15\n      // `o.a` i.e. 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\n\nvar g = add.bind(o, 5, 6);       //g: `o.a` i.e. 4 + 5 + 6\ndocument.write(g()+&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;);    //15\n\nvar h = add.bind(o, 5);          //h: `o.a` i.e. 4 + 5 + ?\ndocument.write(h(6) + &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;); //15\n      // 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\ndocument.write(h() + &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;);  //NaN\n      //no parameter is passed to h()\n      //thus inc2 inside add() is `undefined`\n      //4 + 5 + undefined = NaN&lt;/code&gt;\n\n\n7. this inside event handlers\n\n\nWhen you assign function directly to event handlers of an element, use of this directly inside event handling function refers to the corresponding element. Such direct function assignment can be done using addeventListener method or through the traditional event registration methods like onclick.\nSimilarly, when you use this directly inside the event property (like &lt;button onclick=&quot;...this...&quot; &gt;) of the element, it refers to the element.\nHowever use of this indirectly through the other function called inside the event handling function or event property resolves to the global object window.\nThe same above behavior is achieved when we attach the function to the event handler using Microsoft&apos;s Event Registration model method attachEvent. Instead of assigning the function to the event handler (and the thus making the function method of the element), it calls the function on the event (effectively calling it in global context).\n\n\nI recommend to better try this in JSFiddle.\n\n&lt;script&gt; \n    function clickedMe() {\n       alert(this + &quot; : &quot; + this.tagName + &quot; : &quot; + this.id);\n    } \n    document.getElementById(&quot;button1&quot;).addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, clickedMe, false);\n    document.getElementById(&quot;button2&quot;).onclick = clickedMe;\n    document.getElementById(&quot;button5&quot;).attachEvent(&apos;onclick&apos;, clickedMe);   \n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Using `this` &quot;directly&quot; inside event handler or event property&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;button id=&quot;button1&quot;&gt;click() &quot;assigned&quot; using addEventListner() &lt;/button&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;button id=&quot;button2&quot;&gt;click() &quot;assigned&quot; using click() &lt;/button&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;button id=&quot;button3&quot; onclick=&quot;alert(this+ &apos; : &apos; + this.tagName + &apos; : &apos; + this.id);&quot;&gt;used `this` directly in click event property&lt;/button&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Using `this` &quot;indirectly&quot; inside event handler or event property&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;button onclick=&quot;alert((function(){return this + &apos; : &apos; + this.tagName + &apos; : &apos; + this.id;})());&quot;&gt;`this` used indirectly, inside function &lt;br /&gt; defined &amp; called inside event property&lt;/button&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n\n&lt;button id=&quot;button4&quot; onclick=&quot;clickedMe()&quot;&gt;`this` used indirectly, inside function &lt;br /&gt; called inside event property&lt;/button&gt; &lt;br /&gt;\n\nIE only: &lt;button id=&quot;button5&quot;&gt;click() &quot;attached&quot; using attachEvent() &lt;/button&gt;\n\n\n8. this in ES6 arrow function \n\nIn an arrow function, this will behave like common variables: it will be inherited from its lexical scope. The function&apos;s this, where the arrow function is defined, will be the arrow function&apos;s this.\n\nSo, that&apos;s the same behavior as:\n\n(function(){}).bind(this)\n\n\nSee the following code:\n\nconst globalArrowFunction = () =&gt; {\n  return this;\n};\n\nconsole.log(globalArrowFunction()); //window\n\nconst contextObject = {\n  method1: () =&gt; {return this},\n  method2: function(){\n    return () =&gt; {return this};\n  }\n};\n\nconsole.log(contextObject.method1()); //window\n\nconst contextLessFunction = contextObject.method1;\n\nconsole.log(contextLessFunction()); //window\n\nconsole.log(contextObject.method2()()) //contextObject\n\nconst innerArrowFunction = contextObject.method2();\n\nconsole.log(innerArrowFunction()); //contextObject \n\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/how-does-the-&quot;this&quot;-keyword-work-and-when-should-it-be-used-1657384384385#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Javascript&apos;s this\n\nSimple function invocation\n\nConsider the following function:\n\nfunction foo() {\n    console.log(&quot;bar&quot;);\n    console.log(this);\n}\nfoo(); // calling the function\n\n\nNote that we are running this in the normal mode, i.e. strict mode is not used.\n\nWhen running in a browser, the value of this would be logged as window. This is because window is the global variable in a web browser&apos;s scope.\n\nIf you run this same piece of code in an environment like node.js, this would refer to the global variable in your app.\n\nNow if we run this in strict mode by adding the statement &quot;use strict&quot;; to the beginning of the function declaration, this would no longer refer to the global variable in either of the environments. This is done to avoid confusions in strict mode. this would, in this case just log undefined, because that is what it is, it is not defined.\n\nIn the following cases, we would see how to manipulate the value of this.\n\nCalling a function on an object\n\nThere are different ways to do this. If you have called native methods in Javascript like forEach and slice, you should already know that the this variable in that case refers to the Object on which you called that function (Note that in javascript, just about everything is an Object, including Arrays and Functions). Take the following code for example.\n\nvar myObj = {key: &quot;Obj&quot;};\nmyObj.logThis = function () {\n    // I am a method\n    console.log(this);\n}\nmyObj.logThis(); // myObj is logged\n\n\nIf an Object contains a property which holds a Function, the property is called a method. This method, when called, will always have it&apos;s this variable set to the Object it is associated with. This is true for both strict and non-strict modes.\n\nNote that if a method is stored (or rather, copied) in another variable, the reference to this is no longer preserved in the new variable. For example:\n\n// continuing with the previous code snippet\n\nvar myVar = myObj.logThis;\nmyVar();\n// logs either of window/global/undefined based on mode of operation\n\n\nConsidering a more commonly practical scenario:\n\nvar el = document.getElementById(&apos;idOfEl&apos;);\nel.addEventListener(&apos;click&apos;, function() { console.log(this) });\n// the function called by addEventListener contains this as the reference to the element\n// so clicking on our element would log that element itself\n\n\nThe new keyword\n\nConsider a constructor function in Javascript:\n\nfunction Person (name) {\n    this.name = name;\n    this.sayHello = function () {\n        console.log (&quot;Hello&quot;, this);\n    }\n}\n\nvar awal = new Person(&quot;Awal&quot;);\nawal.sayHello();\n// In `awal.sayHello`, `this` contains the reference to the variable `awal`\n\n\nHow does this work? Well, let&apos;s see what happens when we use the new keyword.\n\n\nCalling the function with the new keyword would immediately initialize an Object of type Person.\nThe constructor of this Object has its constructor set to Person. Also, note that typeof awal would return Object only.\nThis new Object would be assigned the prototype of Person.prototype. This means that any method or property in the Person prototype would be available to all instances of Person, including awal.\nThe function Person itself is now invoked; this being a reference to the newly constructed object awal.\n\n\nPretty straightforward, eh?\n\nNote that the official ECMAScript spec nowhere states that such types of functions are actual constructor functions. They are just normal functions, and new can be used on any function. It&apos;s just that we use them as such, and so we call them as such only.\n\nCalling functions on Functions: call and apply\n\nSo yeah, since functions are also Objects (and in-fact first class variables in Javascript), even functions have methods which are... well, functions themselves.\n\nAll functions inherit from the global Function, and two of its many methods are call and apply, and both can be used to manipulate the value of this in the function on which they are called.\n\nfunction foo () { console.log (this, arguments); }\nvar thisArg = {myObj: &quot;is cool&quot;};\nfoo.call(thisArg, 1, 2, 3);\n\n\nThis is a typical example of using call. It basically takes the first parameter and sets this in the function foo as a reference to thisArg.  All other parameters passed to call is passed to the function foo as arguments.\nSo the above code will log {myObj: &quot;is cool&quot;}, [1, 2, 3] in the console. Pretty nice way to change the value of this in any function.\n\napply is almost the same as call accept that it takes only two parameters: thisArg and an array which contains the arguments to be passed to the function. So the above call call can be translated to apply like this:\n\nfoo.apply(thisArg, [1,2,3])\n\n\nNote that call and apply can override the value of this set by dot method invocation we discussed in the second bullet.\nSimple enough :)\n\nPresenting.... bind!\n\nbind is a brother of call and apply.  It is also a method inherited by all functions from the global Function constructor in Javascript. The difference between bind and call/apply is that both call and apply will actually invoke the function. bind, on the other hand, returns a new function with the thisArg and arguments pre-set. Let&apos;s take an example to better understand this:\n\nfunction foo (a, b) {\n    console.log (this, arguments);\n}\nvar thisArg = {myObj: &quot;even more cool now&quot;};\nvar bound = foo.bind(thisArg, 1, 2);\nconsole.log (typeof bound); // logs `function`\nconsole.log (bound);\n/* logs `function () { native code }` */\n\nbound(); // calling the function returned by `.bind`\n// logs `{myObj: &quot;even more cool now&quot;}, [1, 2]`\n\n\nSee the difference between the three? It is subtle, but they are used differently. Like call and apply, bind will also over-ride the value of this set by dot-method invocation.\n\nAlso note that neither of these three functions do any change to the original function. call and apply would return the value from freshly constructed functions while bind will return the freshly constructed function itself, ready to be called.\n\nExtra stuff, copy this\n\nSometimes, you don&apos;t like the fact that this changes with scope, especially nested scope. Take a look at the following example.\n\nvar myObj = {\n    hello: function () {\n        return &quot;world&quot;\n        },\n    myMethod: function () {\n        // copy this, variable names are case-sensitive\n        var that = this;\n        // callbacks ftw \\o/\n        foo.bar(&quot;args&quot;, function () {\n            // I want to call `hello` here\n            this.hello(); // error\n            // but `this` references to `foo` damn!\n            // oh wait we have a backup \\o/\n            that.hello(); // &quot;world&quot;\n        });\n    }\n  };\n\n\nIn the above code, we see that the value of this changed with the nested scope, but we wanted the value of this from the original scope. So we &apos;copied&apos; this to that and used the copy instead of this. Clever, eh?\n\nIndex:\n\n\nWhat is held in this by default?\nWhat if we call the function as a method with Object-dot notation?\nWhat if we use the new keyword?\nHow do we manipulate this with call and apply?\nUsing bind.\nCopying this to solve nested-scope issues.\n\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/how-does-the-&quot;this&quot;-keyword-work-and-when-should-it-be-used-1657384384385#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"&quot;this&quot; is all about scope.

Hopefully this article will lay all those to rest once and for all. And a lot more. Please read the entire article carefully. Be forewarned that this article is long.\n\nIrrespective of the context in which it is used, &quot;this&quot; always references the &quot;current object&quot; in Javascript. However, what the &quot;current object&quot; is  differs according to context. The context may be exactly 1 of the 6 following:\n\n\nGlobal (i.e. Outside all functions)\nInside Direct &quot;Non Bound Function&quot; Call (i.e. a function that has not been bound by calling functionName.bind)\nInside Indirect &quot;Non Bound Function&quot; Call through functionName.call and functionName.apply\nInside &quot;Bound Function&quot; Call (i.e. a function that has been bound by calling functionName.bind)\nWhile Object Creation through &quot;new&quot;\nInside Inline DOM event handler\n\n\nThe following describes each of this contexts one by one:\n\n\nGlobal Context (i.e. Outside all functions):\n\nOutside all functions (i.e. in global context) the &quot;current\nobject&quot; (and hence the value of &quot;this&quot;) is always the\n&quot;window&quot; object for browsers.\nInside Direct &quot;Non Bound Function&quot; Call: \n\nInside a Direct  &quot;Non Bound Function&quot; Call, the object that\ninvoked the function call becomes the &quot;current object&quot; (and hence\nthe value of &quot;this&quot;). If a function is called without a explicit current object, the current object is either the &quot;window&quot; object (For Non Strict Mode) or undefined (For Strict Mode)  . Any function (or variable) defined in\nGlobal Context automatically becomes a property of the &quot;window&quot; object.For e.g Suppose function is defined in Global Context as \n\nfunction UserDefinedFunction(){\n    alert(this)\n    }\n\n\nit becomes the property of the window object, as if you have defined\nit as\n\nwindow.UserDefinedFunction=function(){\n  alert(this)\n}  \n\n\nIn &quot;Non Strict Mode&quot;, Calling/Invoking this function directly through   &quot;UserDefinedFunction()&quot; will automatically call/invoke\nit as &quot;window.UserDefinedFunction()&quot; making &quot;window&quot; as the\n&quot;current object&quot; (and hence the value of &quot;this&quot;) within &quot;UserDefinedFunction&quot;.Invoking this function in &quot;Non Strict Mode&quot; will result in the following\n\nUserDefinedFunction() // displays [object Window]  as it automatically gets invoked as window.UserDefinedFunction()\n\n\nIn &quot;Strict Mode&quot;, Calling/Invoking the function directly through\n&quot;UserDefinedFunction()&quot; will &quot;NOT&quot; automatically call/invoke it as &quot;window.UserDefinedFunction()&quot;.Hence the &quot;current\nobject&quot; (and the value of &quot;this&quot;) within\n&quot;UserDefinedFunction&quot; shall be undefined. Invoking this function in &quot;Strict Mode&quot; will result in the following\n\nUserDefinedFunction() // displays undefined\n\n\nHowever, invoking it explicitly using window object shall result in\nthe following\n\nwindow.UserDefinedFunction() // &quot;always displays [object Window]   irrespective of mode.&quot;\n\n\nLet us look at another example. Please look at the following code\n\n function UserDefinedFunction()\n    {\n        alert(this.a + &quot;,&quot;  + this.b + &quot;,&quot;  + this.c  + &quot;,&quot;  + this.d)\n    }\n\nvar o1={\n            a:1,\n            b:2,\n            f:UserDefinedFunction\n      }\nvar o2={\n            c:3,\n            d:4,\n            f:UserDefinedFunction\n       }\n\no1.f() // Shall display 1,2,undefined,undefined\no2.f() // Shall display undefined,undefined,3,4\n\n\nIn the above example we see that when &quot;UserDefinedFunction&quot; was\ninvoked through o1, &quot;this&quot; takes value of o1 and the\nvalue of its properties &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; get displayed. The value\nof &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; were shown as undefined as o1 does\nnot define these properties\n\nSimilarly when &quot;UserDefinedFunction&quot; was invoked through o2,\n&quot;this&quot; takes value of o2 and the value of its properties &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; get displayed.The value of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; were shown as undefined as o2 does not define these properties.\nInside Indirect &quot;Non Bound Function&quot; Call through functionName.call and functionName.apply:\n\nWhen a &quot;Non Bound Function&quot; is called through\nfunctionName.call or functionName.apply, the &quot;current object&quot; (and hence the value of &quot;this&quot;) is set to the value of\n&quot;this&quot; parameter (first parameter) passed to call/apply. The following code demonstrates the same.\n\nfunction UserDefinedFunction()\n{\n    alert(this.a + &quot;,&quot;  + this.b + &quot;,&quot;  + this.c  + &quot;,&quot;  + this.d)\n}\nvar o1={\n            a:1,\n            b:2,\n            f:UserDefinedFunction\n       }\nvar o2={\n            c:3,\n            d:4,\n            f:UserDefinedFunction\n       }\n\nUserDefinedFunction.call(o1) // Shall display 1,2,undefined,undefined\nUserDefinedFunction.apply(o1) // Shall display 1,2,undefined,undefined\n\nUserDefinedFunction.call(o2) // Shall display undefined,undefined,3,4\nUserDefinedFunction.apply(o2) // Shall display undefined,undefined,3,4\n\no1.f.call(o2) // Shall display undefined,undefined,3,4\no1.f.apply(o2) // Shall display undefined,undefined,3,4\n\no2.f.call(o1) // Shall display 1,2,undefined,undefined\no2.f.apply(o1) // Shall display 1,2,undefined,undefined\n\n\nThe above code clearly shows that the &quot;this&quot; value for any &quot;NON\nBound Function&quot; can be altered through call/apply. Also,if the\n&quot;this&quot; parameter is  not explicitly passed to call/apply, &quot;current object&quot; (and hence the value of &quot;this&quot;) is set to &quot;window&quot; in Non strict mode and &quot;undefined&quot; in strict mode.\nInside &quot;Bound Function&quot; Call (i.e. a function that has been bound by calling functionName.bind):\n\nA bound function is a function whose &quot;this&quot; value has been\nfixed. The following code demonstrated how &quot;this&quot; works in case\nof bound function\n\nfunction UserDefinedFunction()\n{\n    alert(this.a + &quot;,&quot;  + this.b + &quot;,&quot;  + this.c  + &quot;,&quot;  + this.d)\n}\nvar o1={\n          a:1,\n          b:2,\n          f:UserDefinedFunction,\n          bf:null\n       }\nvar o2={\n           c:3,\n           d:4,\n           f:UserDefinedFunction,\n           bf:null\n        }\n\nvar bound1=UserDefinedFunction.bind(o1); // permanantly fixes &quot;this&quot; value of function &quot;bound1&quot; to Object o1\nbound1() // Shall display 1,2,undefined,undefined\n\nvar bound2=UserDefinedFunction.bind(o2); // permanantly fixes &quot;this&quot; value of function &quot;bound2&quot; to Object o2\nbound2() // Shall display undefined,undefined,3,4\n\nvar bound3=o1.f.bind(o2); // permanantly fixes &quot;this&quot; value of function &quot;bound3&quot; to Object o2\nbound3() // Shall display undefined,undefined,3,4\n\nvar bound4=o2.f.bind(o1); // permanantly fixes &quot;this&quot; value of function &quot;bound4&quot; to Object o1\nbound4() // Shall display 1,2,undefined,undefined\n\no1.bf=UserDefinedFunction.bind(o2) // permanantly fixes &quot;this&quot; value of function &quot;o1.bf&quot; to Object o2\no1.bf() // Shall display undefined,undefined,3,4\n\no2.bf=UserDefinedFunction.bind(o1) // permanantly fixes &quot;this&quot; value of function &quot;o2.bf&quot; to Object o1\no2.bf() // Shall display 1,2,undefined,undefined\n\nbound1.call(o2) // Shall still display 1,2,undefined,undefined. &quot;call&quot; cannot alter the value of &quot;this&quot; for bound function\n\nbound1.apply(o2) // Shall still display 1,2,undefined,undefined. &quot;apply&quot; cannot alter the value of &quot;this&quot; for bound function\n\no2.bf.call(o2) // Shall still display 1,2,undefined,undefined. &quot;call&quot; cannot alter the value of &quot;this&quot; for bound function\no2.bf.apply(o2) // Shall still display 1,2,undefined,undefined.&quot;apply&quot; cannot alter the value of &quot;this&quot; for bound function\n\n\nAs given in the code above, &quot;this&quot; value for any &quot;Bound Function&quot;\nCANNOT be altered through call/apply. Also, if the &quot;this&quot;\nparameter is  not explicitly passed to bind, &quot;current object&quot;\n(and hence the value of &quot;this&quot; ) is set to &quot;window&quot; in Non\nstrict mode and &quot;undefined&quot; in strict mode.  One more thing.\nBinding an already bound function does not change the value of &quot;this&quot;.\nIt remains set as the value set by first bind function.\nWhile Object Creation through &quot;new&quot;:\n\nInside a constructor function, the &quot;current object&quot; (and hence the value of \n&quot;this&quot;) references the object that is currently being created\nthrough &quot;new&quot; irrespective of the bind status of the function. However\nif the constructor is a bound function it shall get called with \npredefined set of arguments as set for the bound function.\nInside Inline DOM event handler:\n\nPlease look at the following HTML Snippet\n\n&lt;button onclick=&apos;this.style.color=white&apos;&gt;Hello World&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;div style=&apos;width:100px;height:100px;&apos; onclick=&apos;OnDivClick(event,this)&apos;&gt;Hello World&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\nThe &quot;this&quot; in above examples refer to &quot;button&quot; element and the\n&quot;div&quot; element respectively.\n\nIn the first example, the font color of the button shall be set to\nwhite when it is clicked.\n\nIn the second example when the &quot;div&quot; element is clicked it shall\ncall the OnDivClick function with its second parameter\nreferencing the clicked div element. However the value of &quot;this&quot;\nwithin OnDivClick SHALL NOT reference the clicked div\nelement. It shall be set as the &quot;window object&quot; or\n&quot;undefined&quot; in Non strict and Strict Modes respectively (if OnDivClick is an unbound function) or set to a predefined\nBound value (if OnDivClick is a bound function)\n\n\nThe following summarizes the entire article\n\n\nIn Global Context &quot;this&quot; always refers to the &quot;window&quot; object\nWhenever a function is invoked, it is invoked in context of an\nobject (&quot;current object&quot;). If the current object is not explicitly provided,\nthe current object  is the &quot;window object&quot; in NON Strict\nMode and &quot;undefined&quot; in Strict Mode by default.\nThe value of &quot;this&quot; within a Non Bound function is the reference to object in context of which the function is invoked (&quot;current object&quot;)\nThe value of &quot;this&quot; within a Non Bound function can be overriden by\ncall and apply methods of the function.\nThe value of &quot;this&quot; is fixed for a Bound function and cannot be\noverriden by call and apply methods of the function.\nBinding and already bound function does not change the value of &quot;this&quot;.

Person is called and its this is set to reference that new object. \n\nFunction call\n\nfunction testFunc() {\n    this.name = &quot;Name&quot;;\n    this.myCustomAttribute = &quot;Custom Attribute&quot;;\n    return this;\n}\n\nvar whatIsThis = testFunc();\nconsole.log(whatIsThis); //window\n\nvar whatIsThis2 = new testFunc();\nconsole.log(whatIsThis2);  //testFunc() / object\n\nconsole.log(window.myCustomAttribute); //Custom Attribute \n\n\nIf we miss new keyword, whatIsThis referes to the most global context it can find(window)\n\nWith event handlers\n\nIf the event handler is inline, this refers to global object\n\n&lt;script type=&quot;application/javascript&quot;&gt;\n    function click_handler() {\n        alert(this); // alerts the window object\n    }\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;button id=&apos;thebutton&apos; onclick=&apos;click_handler()&apos;&gt;Click me!&lt;/button&gt;\n\n\nWhen adding event handler through JavaScript, this refers to DOM element that generated the event.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also manipulate the context using .apply() .call() and .bind()\nJQuery proxy is another way you can use to make sure this in a function will be the value you desire.

It is\n\nfunctionObject.call(objectForThis, arg0, arg1, arg2, ...);\n\n\nThere is always some value supplied for objectForThis.\n\nEverything else is syntactic sugar for functionObject.call\n\nSo, everything else can be described by how it translates into functionObject.call.\n\nIf you just call a function then this is the &quot;global object&quot; which in the browser is the window\n\n\n\nfunction foo() {\n  console.log(this);\n}\n\nfoo();  // this is the window object\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\nIn other words, \n\nfoo();\n\n\nwas effectively translated into\n\nfoo.call(window);\n\n\nNote that if you use strict mode then this will be undefined\n\n\n\n&apos;use strict&apos;;\n\nfunction foo() {\n  console.log(this);\n}\n\nfoo();  // this is the window object\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\nwhich means\n\nIn other words, \n\nfoo();\n\n\nwas effectively translated into\n\nfoo.call(undefined);\n\n\nIn JavaScript there are operators like + and - and *. There is also the dot operator which is .\n\nThe . operator when used with a function on the right and an object on the left effectively means &quot;pass object as this to function.\n\nExample\n\n\n\nconst bar = {\n  name: &apos;bar&apos;,\n  foo() { \n    console.log(this); \n  },\n};\n\nbar.foo();  // this is bar\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\nIn other words bar.foo() translates into const temp = bar.foo; temp.call(bar);\n\nNote that it doesn&apos;t matter how the function was created (mostly...). All of these will produce the same results\n\n\n\nconst bar = {\n  name: &apos;bar&apos;,\n  fn1() { console.log(this); },\n  fn2: function() { console.log(this); },\n  fn3: otherFunction,\n};\n\nfunction otherFunction() { console.log(this) };\n\nbar.fn1();  // this is bar\nbar.fn2();  // this is bar\nbar.fn3();  // this is bar\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\nAgain these all are just syntactic sugar for\n\n{ const temp = bar.fn1; temp.call(bar); }\n{ const temp = bar.fn2; temp.call(bar); }\n{ const temp = bar.fn3; temp.call(bar); }\n\n\nOne other wrinkle is the prototype chain. When you use a.b JavaScript first looks on the object referenced directly by a for the property b. If b is not found on the object then JavaScript will look in the object&apos;s prototype to find b. \n\nThere are various ways to define an object&apos;s prototype, the most common in 2019 is the class keyword. For the purposes of this though it doesn&apos;t matter. What matters is that as it looks in object a for property b if it finds property b on the object or in it&apos;s prototype chain if b ends up being a function then the same rules as above apply. The function b references will be called using the call method and passing a as objectForThis as shown a the top of this answer.\n\nNow. Let&apos;s imagine we make a function that explicitly sets this before calling another function and then call it with the . (dot) operator\n\n\n\nfunction foo() {\n  console.log(this);\n}\n\nfunction bar() {\n  const objectForThis = {name: &apos;moo&apos;}\n  foo.call(objectForThis);  // explicitly passing objectForThis\n}\n\nconst obj = {\n  bar,\n};\n\nobj.bar();  \n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\nFollowing the translation to use call, obj.bar() becomes const temp = obj.bar; temp.call(obj);. When we enter the bar function we call foo but we explicitly passed in another object for objectForThis so when we arrive at foo this is that inner object.\n\nThis is what both bind and =&gt; functions effectively do. They are more syntactic sugar. They effectively build a new invisible function exactly like bar above that explicitly sets this before it calls whatever function is specified. In the case of bind this is set to whatever you pass to bind.\n\n\n\nfunction foo() {\n  console.log(this);\n}\n\nconst bar = foo.bind({name: &apos;moo&apos;});\n\n// bind created a new invisible function that calls foo with the bound object.\n\nbar();  \n\n// the objectForThis we are passing to bar here is ignored because\n// the invisible function that bind created will call foo with with\n// the object we bound above\n\nbar.call({name: &apos;other&apos;});\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\nNote that if functionObject.bind did not exist we could make our own like this\n\nfunction bind(fn, objectForThis) {\n  return function(...args) {\n    return fn.call(objectForthis, ...args);\n  };\n}\n\n\nand then we could call it like this\n\nfunction foo() {\n  console.log(this);\n}\n\nconst bar = bind(foo, {name:&apos;abc&apos;});\n\n\nArrow functions, the =&gt; operator are syntactic sugar for bind\n\nconst a = () =&gt; {console.log(this)};\n\n\nis the same as\n\nconst tempFn = function() {console.log(this)}; \nconst a = tempFn.bind(this);\n\n\nJust like bind, a new invisible function is created that calls the given function with a bound value for objectForThis but unlike bind the object to be bound is implicit. It&apos;s whatever this happens to be when the =&gt; operator is used.\n\nSo, just like the rules above\n\nconst a = () =&gt; { console.log(this); }  // this is the global object\n\n\n&apos;use strict&apos;;\nconst a = () =&gt; { console.log(this); }  // this is undefined\n\n\nfunction foo() {\n  return () =&gt; { console.log(this); }\n}\n\nconst obj = {\n  foo,\n};\nconst b = obj.foo();\nb();\n\n\nobj.foo() translates to const temp = obj.foo; temp.call(obj); which means the arrow operator inside foo will bind obj to a new invisible function and return that new invisible function which is assigned to b. b() will work as it always has as b.call(window) or b.call(undefined) calling the new invisible function that foo created. That invisible function ignores the this passed into it and  passes obj as objectForThis` to the arrow function.\n\nThe code above translates to\n\nfunction foo() {\n  function tempFn() {\n    console.log(this);\n  }\n  return tempFn.bind(this);\n}\n\nconst obj = {\n  foo,\n};\nconst b = obj.foo();\nb.call(window or undefined if strict mode);\n\n\n1apply is another function similar to call\n\nfunctionName.apply(objectForThis, arrayOfArgs);\n\n\nBut as of ES6 conceptually you can even translate that into\n\nfunctionName.call(objectForThis, ...arrayOfArgs);\n\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/how-does-the-&quot;this&quot;-keyword-work-and-when-should-it-be-used-1657384384385#solution18","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"this use for Scope just like this\n\n  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; language=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;\n$(&apos;#tbleName tbody tr&apos;).each(function{\nvar txt=&apos;&apos;;\ntxt += $(this).find(&quot;td&quot;).eq(0).text();\n\\\\same as above but synatx different\nvar txt1=&apos;&apos;;\n txt1+=$(&apos;#tbleName tbody tr&apos;).eq(0).text();\nalert(txt1)\n});\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\nvalue of txt1 and txt is same\nin Above example \n$(this)=$(&apos;#tbleName tbody tr&apos;) is Same\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/how-does-the-&quot;this&quot;-keyword-work-and-when-should-it-be-used-1657384384385#solution19","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Summary this Javascript:\n\n\nThe value of this is determined by how the function is invoked not, where it was created!\nUsually the value of this is determined by the Object which is left of the dot.

(Read more about scope)\n\nContext: Context is related to objects. It refers to the object to which a function belongs. When you use the JavaScript this keyword, it refers to the object to which function belongs. For example, inside of a function, when you say: this.accoutNumber, you are referring to the property accoutNumber, that belongs to the object to which that function belongs. \n\nIf the object myObj has a method called getMyName, when the JavaScript keyword this is used inside of getMyName, it refers to myObj. If the function getMyName were executed in the global scope, then this refers to the window object (except in strict mode). \n\nNow let&apos;s see some example:\n\n    &lt;script&gt;\n        console.log(&apos;What is this: &apos;+this);\n        console.log(this);\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n\n\nRunnig abobve code in browser output will:\n\n\nAccording to the output you are inside of the context of the window object, it is also visible that window prototype refers to the Object.\n\nNow let&apos;s try inside of a function:\n\n    &lt;script&gt;\n        function myFunc(){\n            console.log(&apos;What is this: &apos;+this);\n            console.log(this);\n        }\n        myFunc();\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n\n\nOutput:\n\n\nThe output is the same because we logged &apos;this&apos; variable in the global scope and we logged it in functional scope, we didn&apos;t change the context. In both case context was same, related to widow object. \n\nNow let&apos;s create our own object. In javascript, you can create an object in many ways.\n\n &lt;script&gt;\n        var firstName = &quot;Nora&quot;;\n        var lastName = &quot;Zaman&quot;;\n        var myObj = {\n            firstName:&quot;Lord&quot;,\n            lastName:&apos;Baron&apos;,\n            printNameGetContext:function(){\n                console.log(firstName + &quot; &quot;+lastName);\n                console.log(this.firstName +&quot; &quot;+this.lastName);\n                return this;\n            }\n        }\n\n      var context = myObj.printNameGetContext();\n      console.log(context);\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n\n\nOutput: \n\n\nSo from the above example, we found that &apos;this&apos; keyword is referring to a new context that is related to myObj, and myObject also has prototype chain to Object.\n\nLet&apos;s go throw another example:\n\n&lt;body&gt;\n    &lt;button class=&quot;btn&quot;&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;\n    &lt;script&gt;\n        function printMe(){\n            //Terminal2: this function declared inside window context so this function belongs to the window object.\n            console.log(this);\n        }\n        document.querySelector(&apos;.btn&apos;).addEventListener(&apos;click&apos;, function(){\n            //Terminal1: button context, this callback function belongs to DOM element \n            console.log(this);\n            printMe();\n        })\n    &lt;/script&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n\n\noutput: \nMake sense right?

<p><a href="//developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this" rel="noreferrer"><code>this</code></a> is a keyword in JavaScript that is a property of an execution context. Its main use is in functions and constructors.
The rules for <code>this</code> are quite simple (if you stick to best practices).</p>
<h2>Technical description of <code>this</code> in the specification</h2>
<p>The <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262" rel="noreferrer">ECMAScript standard</a> defines <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-this-keyword" rel="noreferrer"><code>this</code></a> via the abstract operation (abbreviated <em>AO</em>) <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-resolvethisbinding" rel="noreferrer">ResolveThisBinding</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The [AO] ResolveThisBinding [] determines the binding of the keyword <code>this</code> using the LexicalEnvironment of the <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#running-execution-context" rel="noreferrer">running execution context</a>. [Steps]:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let <em>envRec</em> be <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-getthisenvironment" rel="noreferrer">GetThisEnvironment</a>().</li>
<li>Return ? <em>envRec</em>.GetThisBinding().</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-global-environment-records" rel="noreferrer">Global Environment Records</a>, <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-module-environment-records" rel="noreferrer">module Environment Records</a>, and <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-function-environment-records" rel="noreferrer">function Environment Records</a> each have their own GetThisBinding method.</p>
<p>The <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-getthisenvironment" rel="noreferrer">GetThisEnvironment</a> AO finds the current <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#running-execution-context" rel="noreferrer">running execution context</a>s LexicalEnvironment and finds the closest ascendant Environment Record (by iteratively accessing their [[OuterEnv]] properties) which has a <em>this</em> binding (i.e. HasThisBinding returns <strong>true</strong>). This process ends in one of the three Environment Record types.</p>
<p>The value of <code>this</code> often depends on whether code is in <a href="//developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode" rel="noreferrer">strict mode</a>.</p>
<p>The return value of GetThisBinding reflects the value of <code>this</code> of the current execution context, so whenever a new execution context is established, <code>this</code> resolves to a distinct value. This can also happen when the current execution context is modified. The following subsections list the five cases where this can happen.</p>
<p>You can put the code samples in the <a href="//astexplorer.net/" rel="noreferrer">AST explorer</a> to follow along with specification details.</p>
<h3>1. Global execution context in scripts</h3>
<p>This is script code evaluated at the top level, e.g. directly inside a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-html s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span><span class="language-javascript">
<span class="hljs-comment">// Global context</span>
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// Logs global object.</span>

<span class="hljs-built_in">setTimeout</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Not global context"</span>);
});
</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>When in the initial global execution context of a script, evaluating <code>this</code> causes <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-global-environment-records-getthisbinding" rel="noreferrer">GetThisBinding</a> to take the following steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The GetThisBinding concrete method of a global Environment Record <em>envRec</em> [] [does this]:</p>
<ol>
<li>Return <em>envRec</em>.[[GlobalThisValue]].</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The [[GlobalThisValue]] property of a global Environment Record is always set to the host-defined <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-global-object" rel="noreferrer">global object</a>, which is reachable via <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-globalthis" rel="noreferrer"><code>globalThis</code></a> (<code>window</code> on Web, <code>global</code> on Node.js; <a href="//developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/globalThis" rel="noreferrer">Docs on MDN</a>). Follow the steps of <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-initializehostdefinedrealm" rel="noreferrer">InitializeHostDefinedRealm</a> to learn how the [[GlobalThisValue]] property comes to be.</p>
<h3>2. Global execution context in <a href="//developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules" rel="noreferrer">modules</a></h3>
<p>Modules have been introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
<p>This applies to modules, e.g. when directly inside a <code>&lt;script type="module"&gt;</code>, as opposed to a simple <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>When in the initial global execution context of a module, evaluating <code>this</code> causes <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-module-environment-records-getthisbinding" rel="noreferrer">GetThisBinding</a> to take the following steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The GetThisBinding concrete method of a module Environment Record [] [does this]:</p>
<ol>
<li>Return <strong>undefined</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>In modules, the value of <code>this</code> is always <code>undefined</code> in the global context. Modules are implicitly in <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-strict-mode-code" rel="noreferrer">strict mode</a>.</p>
<h3>3. Entering <a href="//developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval" rel="noreferrer">eval</a> code</h3>
<p>There are two kinds of <code>eval</code> calls: <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-function-calls-runtime-semantics-evaluation" rel="noreferrer">direct</a> and <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-eval-x" rel="noreferrer">indirect</a>. This distinction exists since the ECMAScript 5th edition.</p>
<ul>
<li>A direct <code>eval</code> call usually looks like <code>eval(</code><code>);</code> or <code>(eval)(</code><code>);</code> (or <code>((eval))(</code><code>);</code>, etc.).<sup>1</sup> Its only <em>direct</em> if the call expression fits a narrow pattern.<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>An indirect <code>eval</code> call involves calling the function reference <code>eval</code> in any other way. It could be <code>eval?.(</code><code>)</code>, <code>(</code><code>, eval)(</code><code>)</code>, <code>window.eval(</code><code>)</code>, <code>eval.call(</code><code>,</code><code>)</code>, etc. Given <code>const aliasEval1 = eval; window.aliasEval2 = eval;</code>, it would also be <code>aliasEval1(</code><code>)</code>, <code>aliasEval2(</code><code>)</code>. Separately, given <code>const originalEval = eval; window.eval = (x) =&gt; originalEval(x);</code>, calling <code>eval(</code><code>)</code> would also be indirect.</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="//stackoverflow.com/a/9107491/196844">chuckjs answer to <em>(1, eval)('this') vs eval('this') in JavaScript?</em></a> and <a href="//dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/es5-chapter-2-strict-mode#indirect-eval-call" rel="noreferrer">Dmitry Soshnikovs ECMA-262-5 in detail  Chapter 2: Strict Mode</a> (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20210530120958/https://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/es5-chapter-2-strict-mode#indirect-eval-call" rel="noreferrer">archived</a>) for when you might use an indirect <code>eval()</code> call.</p>
<p><a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-performeval" rel="noreferrer">PerformEval</a> executes the <code>eval</code> code. It creates a new <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-declarative-environment-records" rel="noreferrer">declarative Environment Record</a> as its LexicalEnvironment, which is where <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-getthisenvironment" rel="noreferrer">GetThisEnvironment</a> gets the <code>this</code> value from.</p>
<p>Then, if <code>this</code> appears in <code>eval</code> code, the GetThisBinding method of the Environment Record found by <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-getthisenvironment" rel="noreferrer">GetThisEnvironment</a> is called and its value returned.</p>
<p>And the created <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-declarative-environment-records" rel="noreferrer">declarative Environment Record</a> depends on whether the <code>eval</code> call was direct or indirect:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a direct eval, it will be based on the current <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#running-execution-context" rel="noreferrer">running execution context</a>s LexicalEnvironment.</li>
<li>In an indirect eval, it will be based on the [[GlobalEnv]] property (a <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-global-environment-records" rel="noreferrer">global Environment Record</a>) of the <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-code-realms" rel="noreferrer">Realm Record</a> which executed the indirect eval.</li>
</ul>
<p>Which means:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a direct eval, the <code>this</code> value doesnt change; its taken from the lexical scope that called <code>eval</code>.</li>
<li>In an indirect eval, the <code>this</code> value is the global object (<code>globalThis</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What about <code>new Function</code>?</em><a href="//developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/Function" rel="noreferrer"><code>new Function</code></a> is similar to <code>eval</code>, but it doesnt call the code immediately; it creates a function. A <em>this</em> binding doesnt apply anywhere here, except when the function is called, which works normally, as explained in the next subsection.</p>
<h3>4. Entering <a href="//developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions" rel="noreferrer">function</a> code</h3>
<p>Entering function code occurs when <em>calling</em> a function.</p>
<p>There are four categories of syntax to invoke a function.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-evaluatecall" rel="noreferrer">EvaluateCall</a> AO is performed for these three:<sup>3</sup>
<ul>
<li><a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-function-calls-runtime-semantics-evaluation" rel="noreferrer">Normal function calls</a></li>
<li><a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-optional-chaining-evaluation" rel="noreferrer">Optional chaining calls</a></li>
<li><a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-tagged-templates-runtime-semantics-evaluation" rel="noreferrer">Tagged templates</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-evaluatenew" rel="noreferrer">EvaluateNew</a> is performed for this one:<sup>3</sup>
<ul>
<li><a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-new-operator-runtime-semantics-evaluation" rel="noreferrer">Constructor invocations</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual function call happens at the <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-call" rel="noreferrer">Call</a> AO, which is called with a <em>thisValue</em> determined from context; this argument is passed along in a long chain of call-related calls. <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-call" rel="noreferrer">Call</a> calls the <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-ecmascript-function-objects-call-thisargument-argumentslist" rel="noreferrer">[[Call]]</a> internal slot of the function. This calls <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-prepareforordinarycall" rel="noreferrer">PrepareForOrdinaryCall</a> where a new <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-function-environment-records" rel="noreferrer">function Environment Record</a> is created:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>function Environment Record</em> is a declarative Environment Record that is used to represent the top-level scope of a function and, if the function is not an <em>ArrowFunction</em>, provides a <code>this</code> binding. If a function is not an <em>ArrowFunction</em> function and references <code>super</code>, its function Environment Record also contains the state that is used to perform <code>super</code> method invocations from within the function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, there is the [[ThisValue]] field in a function Environment Record:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the <code>this</code> value used for this invocation of the function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-newfunctionenvironment" rel="noreferrer">NewFunctionEnvironment</a> call also sets the function environments [[ThisBindingStatus]] property.</p>
<p><a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-ecmascript-function-objects-call-thisargument-argumentslist" rel="noreferrer">[[Call]]</a> also calls <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-ordinarycallbindthis" rel="noreferrer">OrdinaryCallBindThis</a>, where the appropriate <em>thisArgument</em> is determined based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>the original reference,</li>
<li>the kind of the function, and</li>
<li>whether or not the code is in <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-strict-mode-code" rel="noreferrer">strict mode</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once determined, a final call to the <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-bindthisvalue" rel="noreferrer">BindThisValue</a> method of the newly created function Environment Record actually sets the [[ThisValue]] field to the <em>thisArgument</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, this very field is where a <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-function-environment-records" rel="noreferrer">function Environment Records</a> <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-function-environment-records-getthisbinding" rel="noreferrer">GetThisBinding</a> AO gets the value for <code>this</code> from:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The GetThisBinding concrete method of a function Environment Record <em>envRec</em> [] [does this]:</p>
<p>[]<br>
3. Return <em>envRec</em>.[[ThisValue]].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, how exactly the <em>this</em> value is determined depends on many factors; this was just a general overview. With this technical background, lets examine all the concrete examples.</p>
<h4><a href="//developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions" rel="noreferrer">Arrow functions</a></h4>
<p>When an <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-runtime-semantics-instantiatearrowfunctionexpression" rel="noreferrer">arrow function</a> is evaluated, the [[ThisMode]] internal slot of the function object is set to <em>lexical</em> in <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-ordinaryfunctioncreate" rel="noreferrer">OrdinaryFunctionCreate</a>.</p>
<p>At <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-ordinarycallbindthis" rel="noreferrer">OrdinaryCallBindThis</a>, which takes a function <em>F</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Let <em>thisMode</em> be <em>F</em>.[[ThisMode]].</li>
<li>If <em>thisMode</em> is <em>lexical</em>, return NormalCompletion(<code>undefined</code>).
[]</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>which just means that the rest of the algorithm which binds <em>this</em> is skipped. An arrow function does not bind its own <em>this</em> value.</p>
<p>So, what is <code>this</code> inside an arrow function, then? Looking back at <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-resolvethisbinding" rel="noreferrer">ResolveThisBinding</a> and <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-getthisenvironment" rel="noreferrer">GetThisEnvironment</a>, the <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-function-environment-records-hasthisbinding" rel="noreferrer">HasThisBinding method explicitly returns <strong>false</strong></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The HasThisBinding concrete method of a function Environment Record <em>envRec</em> [] [does this]:</p>
<ol>
<li>If <em>envRec</em>.[[ThisBindingStatus]] is <em>lexical</em>, return <strong>false</strong>; otherwise, return <strong>true</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So the outer environment is looked up instead, iteratively. The process will end in one of the three environments that have a <em>this</em> binding.</p>
<p>This just means that, <strong>in arrow function bodies, <code>this</code> comes from the lexical scope of the arrow function</strong>, or in other words (from <a href="//stackoverflow.com/a/34361380">Arrow function vs function declaration / expressions: Are they equivalent / exchangeable?</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arrow functions dont have their own <code>this</code> [] binding. Instead, [this identifier is] resolved in the lexical scope like any other variable. That means that inside an arrow function, <code>this</code> [refers] to the [value of <code>this</code>] in the environment the arrow function is <em>defined</em> in (i.e. outside the arrow function).</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Function <a href="//developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_Accessors" rel="noreferrer">properties</a></h4>
<p>In normal functions (<code>function</code>, <a href="//developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Method_definitions" rel="noreferrer">methods</a>), <code>this</code> is determined <strong>by how the function is called</strong>.</p>
<p>This is where these syntax variants come in handy.</p>
<p>Consider this object containing a function:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> refObj = {
    <span class="hljs-attr">func</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
      <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>);
    }
  };
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> refObj = {
    <span class="hljs-title function_">func</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
      <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>);
    }
  };
</code></pre>
<p>In any of the following function calls, the <code>this</code> value inside <code>func</code> will be <code>refObj</code>.<sup>1</sup></p>
<ul>
<li><code>refObj.func()</code></li>
<li><code>refObj["func"]()</code></li>
<li><code>refObj?.func()</code></li>
<li><code>refObj.func?.()</code></li>
<li><code>refObj.func``</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If the called function is syntactically a property of a base object, then this base will be the reference of the call, which, in usual cases, will be the value of <code>this</code>. This is explained by the evaluation steps linked above; for example, in <code>refObj.func()</code> (or <code>refObj["func"]()</code>), the <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-CallMemberExpression" rel="noreferrer"><em>CallMemberExpression</em></a> is the entire expression <code>refObj.func()</code>, which consists of the <em><a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-MemberExpression" rel="noreferrer">MemberExpression</a></em> <code>refObj.func</code> and the <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-Arguments" rel="noreferrer"><em>Arguments</em></a> <code>()</code>.</p>
<p>But also, <code>refObj.func</code> and <code>refObj</code> play three roles, each:</p>
<ul>
<li>theyre both expressions,</li>
<li>theyre both references, and</li>
<li>theyre both values.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>refObj.func</code> as a <em>value</em> is the callable function object; the corresponding <em>reference</em> is used to determine the <code>this</code> binding.</p>
<p>The optional chaining and tagged template examples work very similarly: basically, the reference is everything before the <code>?.()</code>, before the <code>``</code>, or before the <code>()</code>.</p>
<p><a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-evaluatecall" rel="noreferrer">EvaluateCall</a> uses <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-ispropertyreference" rel="noreferrer">IsPropertyReference</a> of that reference to determine if it is a property of an object, syntactically. Its trying to get the [[Base]] property of the reference (which is e.g. <code>refObj</code>, when applied to <code>refObj.func</code>; or <code>foo.bar</code> when applied to <code>foo.bar.baz</code>). If it is written as a property, then <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-getthisvalue" rel="noreferrer">GetThisValue</a> will get this [[Base]] property and use it as the <em>this</em> value.</p>
<p>Note: <a href="//developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get" rel="noreferrer">Getters / Setters</a> work the same way as methods, regarding <code>this</code>. Simple properties dont affect the execution context, e.g. here, <code>this</code> is in global scope:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> o = {
    <span class="hljs-attr">a</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attr">b</span>: <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">a</span>, <span class="hljs-comment">// Is `globalThis.a`.</span>
    [<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">a</span>]: <span class="hljs-number">2</span> <span class="hljs-comment">// Refers to `globalThis.a`.</span>
  };
</code></pre>
<h4>Calls without base reference, strict mode, and <a href="//developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/with" rel="noreferrer"><code>with</code></a></h4>
<p>A call without a base reference is usually a function that isnt called as a property. For example:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">func</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// As opposed to `refObj.func();`.</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This also happens when <a href="/q/30486345">passing or assigning methods</a>, or using the <a href="/q/35522560">comma operator</a>. This is where the difference between Reference Record and Value is relevant.</p>
<p>Note function <code>j</code>: following the specification, you will notice that <code>j</code> can only return the function object (Value) itself, but not a Reference Record. Therefore the base reference <code>refObj</code> is lost.</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">g</span> = (<span class="hljs-params">f</span>) =&gt; <span class="hljs-title function_">f</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// No base ref.</span>

<p>Note: step 5 sets the actual value of <code>this</code> to the supplied <em>thisArgument</em> in strict mode<code>undefined</code> in this case. In sloppy mode, an undefined or null <em>thisArgument</em> results in <code>this</code> being the global <em>this</em> value.</p>

<p>This is where an undefined <em>thisValue</em> may come from: <em>refEnv</em>.<a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-object-environment-records-withbaseobject" rel="noreferrer">WithBaseObject</a>() is always <strong>undefined</strong>, <em>except</em> in <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-with-statement-runtime-semantics-evaluation" rel="noreferrer"><code>with</code></a> statements.

<p>Another consequence of step 5 of <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-ordinarycallbindthis" rel="noreferrer">OrdinaryCallBindThis</a>, in conjunction with step 6.2 (6.b in the spec), is that a primitive <em>this</em> value is coerced to an object <em>only</em> in sloppy mode.</p>
<p>To examine this, lets introduce another source for the <em>this</em> value: the three methods that override the <em>this</em> binding:<sup>4</sup></p>
<ul>
<li><code>Function.prototype.apply(thisArg, argArray)</code></li>
<li><code>Function.prototype.</code> {<code>call</code>, <code>bind</code>} <code>(thisArg, ...args)</code></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-function.prototype.bind" rel="noreferrer"><code>.bind</code></a> creates a bound function, whose <em>this</em> binding is set to <em>thisArg</em> and cannot change again. <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-function.prototype.call" rel="noreferrer"><code>.call</code></a> and <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-function.prototype.apply" rel="noreferrer"><code>.apply</code></a> call the function immediately, with the <em>this</em> binding set to <em>thisArg</em>.</p>

<p>For objects, this is the same in strict and non-strict mode.</p>

<h3>5. Evaluating class fields</h3>
<p>Instance fields and static fields were introduced in ECMAScript 2022.</p>
<p>When a <code>class</code> is evaluated, <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-runtime-semantics-classdefinitionevaluation" rel="noreferrer">ClassDefinitionEvaluation</a> is performed, modifying the <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#running-execution-context" rel="noreferrer">running execution context</a>. For each <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-ClassElement" rel="noreferrer"><em>ClassElement</em></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>if a field is static, then <code>this</code> refers to the class itself,</li>
<li>if a field is not static, then <code>this</code> refers to the instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Private fields (e.g. <code>#x</code>) and methods are added to a PrivateEnvironment.</p>
<p><a href="//github.com/tc39/proposal-class-static-block" rel="noreferrer">Static blocks</a> are currently a <a href="//tc39.es/process-document/" rel="noreferrer">TC39 stage 3 proposal</a>. Static blocks work the same as static fields and methods: <code>this</code> inside them refers to the class itself.</p>
<p>Note that in methods and getters / setters, <code>this</code> works just like in normal function properties.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>: <code>(o.f)()</code> is equivalent to <code>o.f()</code>; <code>(f)()</code> is equivalent to <code>f()</code>. This is explained in <a href="//2ality.com/2015/12/references.html" rel="noreferrer">this 2ality article</a> (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20210201161804/https://2ality.com/2015/12/references.html" rel="noreferrer">archived</a>). Particularly see <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-grouping-operator" rel="noreferrer">how a <em>ParenthesizedExpression</em> is evaluated</a>.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>: It must be a <em><a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-MemberExpression" rel="noreferrer">MemberExpression</a></em>, must not be a property, must have a [[ReferencedName]] of exactly <strong>"eval"</strong>, and must be the %eval% intrinsic object.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup>: Whenever the specification says <em>Let</em> ref <em>be the result of evaluating</em> X., then <em>X</em> is some expression that you need to find the evaluation steps for. For example, evaluating a <em><a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-MemberExpression" rel="noreferrer">MemberExpression</a></em> or <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-CallExpression" rel="noreferrer"><em>CallExpression</em></a> is the result of one of <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-property-accessors-runtime-semantics-evaluation" rel="noreferrer">these algorithms</a>. Some of them result in a <a href="//tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-reference-record-specification-type" rel="noreferrer">Reference Record</a>.</p>
<p><sup>4</sup>: There are also several other native and host methods that allow providing a <em>this</em> value, notably <code>Array.prototype.map</code>, <code>Array.prototype.forEach</code>, etc. that accept a <em>thisArg</em> as their second argument. Anyone can make their own methods to alter <code>this</code> like <code>(func, thisArg) =&gt; func.bind(thisArg)</code>, <code>(func, thisArg) =&gt; func.call(thisArg)</code>, etc. As always, <a href="//developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference" rel="noreferrer">MDN</a> offers great documentation.</p>

<p>The <code>this</code> keyword behaves differently in JavaScript compared to other languages. In Object Oriented languages, the <code>this</code> keyword refers to the current instance of the class. In JavaScript the value of <code>this</code> is determined by the invocation context of function (<em><code>context.function()</code></em>) and where it is called.</p>

<p><strong>1. When used in global context</strong></p>

<p>When you use <code>this</code> in global context, it is bound to global object (<code>window</code> in browser)</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">write</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>);  <span class="hljs-comment">//[object Window]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>When you use <code>this</code> inside a function defined in the global context, <code>this</code> is still bound to global object since the function is actually made a method of global context.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">f1</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>)
{
   <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>;
}
<span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">write</span>(<span class="hljs-title function_">f1</span>());  <span class="hljs-comment">//[object Window]</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Above <code>f1</code> is made a method of global object. Thus we can also call it on <code>window</code> object as follows:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">f</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>)
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>;
}

<span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">write</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">window</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">f</span>()); <span class="hljs-comment">//[object Window]</span>
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2. When used inside object method</strong></p>

<p>When you use <code>this</code> keyword inside an object method, <code>this</code> is bound to the "immediate" enclosing object.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> obj = {
    <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"obj"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attr">f</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span> + <span class="hljs-string">":"</span> + <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">name</span>;
    }
};
<span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">write</span>(obj.<span class="hljs-title function_">f</span>());  <span class="hljs-comment">//[object Object]:obj</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Above I have put the word immediate in double quotes. It is to make the point that if you nest the object inside another object, then <code>this</code> is bound to the immediate parent.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> obj = {
    <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"obj1"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attr">nestedobj</span>: {
        <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>:<span class="hljs-string">"nestedobj"</span>,
        <span class="hljs-attr">f</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span> + <span class="hljs-string">":"</span> + <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">name</span>;
        }
    }            
}

<span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">write</span>(obj.<span class="hljs-property">nestedobj</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">f</span>()); <span class="hljs-comment">//[object Object]:nestedobj</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Even if you add function explicitly to the object as a method, it still follows above rules, that is <code>this</code> still points to the immediate parent object.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> obj1 = {

<p><strong>Trying it all with functions</strong></p>

<p>We can try above points with functions too. However there are some differences.</p>

<ul>
<li>Above we added members to objects using object literal notation. We can add members to functions by using <code>this</code>. to specify them.</li>
<li>Object literal notation creates an instance of object which we can use immediately. With function we may need to first create its instance using <code>new</code> operator.</li>
<li>Also in an object literal approach, we can explicitly add members to already defined object using dot operator. This gets added to the specific instance only. However I have added variable to the function prototype so that it gets reflected in all instances of the function.</li>
</ul>

<p>Below I tried out all the things that we did with Object and <code>this</code> above, but by first creating function instead of directly writing an object.</p>

<p><strong>6. Inside call(), apply() and bind() functions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>All these methods are defined on <code>Function.prototype</code>.</li>
<li>These methods allows to write a function once and invoke it in different context. In other words, they allows to specify the value of <code>this</code> which will be used while the function is being executed. They also take any parameters to be passed to the original function when it is invoked.</li>
<li><strong><code>fun.apply(obj1 [, argsArray])</code></strong> Sets <code>obj1</code> as the value of <code>this</code> inside <code>fun()</code> and calls <code>fun()</code> passing elements of <code>argsArray</code> as its arguments.</li>
<li><strong><code>fun.call(obj1 [, arg1 [, arg2 [,arg3 [, ...]]]])</code></strong> - Sets <code>obj1</code> as the value of <code>this</code> inside <code>fun()</code> and calls <code>fun()</code> passing <code>arg1, arg2, arg3, ...</code> as its arguments.</li>
<li><strong><code>fun.bind(obj1 [, arg1 [, arg2 [,arg3 [, ...]]]])</code></strong> - Returns the reference to the function <code>fun</code> with <code>this</code> inside fun bound to <code>obj1</code> and parameters of <code>fun</code> bound to the   parameters specified <code>arg1, arg2, arg3,...</code>.</li>
<li>By now the difference between <code>apply</code>, <code>call</code> and <code>bind</code> must have become apparent. <code>apply</code> allows to specify the arguments to function as array-like object i.e. an object with a numeric <code>length</code> property and corresponding non-negative integer properties. Whereas <code>call</code> allows to specify the arguments to the function directly. Both <code>apply</code> and <code>call</code> immediately invokes the function in the specified context and with the specified arguments. On the other hand, <code>bind</code> simply returns the function bound to the specified <code>this</code> value and the arguments. We can capture the reference to this returned function by assigning it to a variable and later we can call it any time.</li>
</ul>

</code></pre>

<p><strong>7. <code>this</code> inside event handlers</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When you assign function directly to event handlers of an element, use of <code>this</code> directly inside event handling function refers to the corresponding element. Such direct function assignment can be done using <code>addeventListener</code> method or through the traditional event registration methods like <code>onclick</code>.</li>
<li>Similarly, when you use <code>this</code> directly inside the event property (like <code>&lt;button onclick="...this..." &gt;</code>) of the element, it refers to the element.</li>
<li>However use of <code>this</code> indirectly through the other function called inside the event handling function or event property resolves to the global object <code>window</code>.</li>
<li>The same above behavior is achieved when we attach the function to the event handler using Microsoft's Event Registration model method <code>attachEvent</code>. Instead of assigning the function to the event handler (and the thus making the function method of the element), it calls the function on the event (effectively calling it in global context).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>8. <code>this</code> in ES6 arrow function</strong> </p>

<p>In an arrow function, <code>this</code> will behave like common variables: it will be inherited from its lexical scope. The function's <code>this</code>, where the arrow function is defined, will be the arrow function's <code>this</code>.</p>

<p>So, that's the same behavior as:</p>

<h1>Javascript's <code>this</code></h1>

<h2>Simple function invocation</h2>

<p>Consider the following function:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span>);
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>);
}
<span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// calling the function</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we are running this in the normal mode, i.e. strict mode is not used.</p>

<p>When running in a browser, the value of <code>this</code> would be logged as <code>window</code>. This is because <code>window</code> is the global variable in a web browser's scope.</p>

<p>If you run this same piece of code in an environment like node.js, <code>this</code> would refer to the global variable in your app.</p>

<p>Now if we run this in strict mode by adding the statement <code>"use strict";</code> to the beginning of the function declaration, <code>this</code> would no longer refer to the global variable in either of the environments. This is done to avoid confusions in strict mode. <code>this</code> would, in this case just log <code>undefined</code>, because that is what it is, it is not defined.</p>

<p>In the following cases, we would see how to manipulate the value of <code>this</code>.</p>

<h2>Calling a function on an object</h2>

<p>There are different ways to do this. If you have called native methods in Javascript like <code>forEach</code> and <code>slice</code>, you should already know that the <code>this</code> variable in that case refers to the <code>Object</code> on which you called that function (Note that in javascript, just about everything is an <code>Object</code>, including <code>Array</code>s and <code>Function</code>s). Take the following code for example.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myObj = {<span class="hljs-attr">key</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"Obj"</span>};
myObj.<span class="hljs-property">logThis</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
    <span class="hljs-comment">// I am a method</span>
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>);
}
myObj.<span class="hljs-title function_">logThis</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// myObj is logged</span>
</code></pre>

<p>If an <code>Object</code> contains a property which holds a <code>Function</code>, the property is called a method. This method, when called, will always have it's <code>this</code> variable set to the <code>Object</code> it is associated with. This is true for both strict and non-strict modes.</p>

<p>Note that if a method is stored (or rather, copied) in another variable, the reference to <code>this</code> is no longer preserved in the new variable. For example:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// continuing with the previous code snippet</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myVar = myObj.<span class="hljs-property">logThis</span>;
<span class="hljs-title function_">myVar</span>();
<span class="hljs-comment">// logs either of window/global/undefined based on mode of operation</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Considering a more commonly practical scenario:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> el = <span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">getElementById</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'idOfEl'</span>);
el.<span class="hljs-title function_">addEventListener</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) { <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>) });
<span class="hljs-comment">// the function called by addEventListener contains this as the reference to the element</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// so clicking on our element would log that element itself</span>
</code></pre>

<h2>The <code>new</code> keyword</h2>

<p>Consider a constructor function in Javascript:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">Person</span> (name) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">name</span> = name;
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">sayHello</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
        <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-property">log</span> (<span class="hljs-string">"Hello"</span>, <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>);
    }
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> awal = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Person</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Awal"</span>);
awal.<span class="hljs-title function_">sayHello</span>();
<span class="hljs-comment">// In `awal.sayHello`, `this` contains the reference to the variable `awal`</span>
</code></pre>

<p>How does this work? Well, let's see what happens when we use the <code>new</code> keyword.</p>

<ol>
<li>Calling the function with the <code>new</code> keyword would immediately initialize an <code>Object</code> of type <code>Person</code>.</li>
<li>The constructor of this <code>Object</code> has its constructor set to <code>Person</code>. Also, note that <code>typeof awal</code> would return <code>Object</code> only.</li>
<li>This new <code>Object</code> would be assigned the prototype of <code>Person.prototype</code>. This means that any method or property in the <code>Person</code> prototype would be available to all instances of <code>Person</code>, including <code>awal</code>.</li>
<li>The function <code>Person</code> itself is now invoked; <code>this</code> being a reference to the newly constructed object <code>awal</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Pretty straightforward, eh?</p>

<p>Note that the official ECMAScript spec nowhere states that such types of functions are actual <code>constructor</code> functions. They are just normal functions, and <code>new</code> can be used on any function. It's just that we use them as such, and so we call them as such only.</p>

<h2>Calling functions on Functions: <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code></h2>

<p>So yeah, since <code>function</code>s are also <code>Objects</code> (and in-fact first class variables in Javascript), even functions have methods which are... well, functions themselves.</p>

<p>All functions inherit from the global <code>Function</code>, and two of its many methods are <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code>, and both can be used to manipulate the value of <code>this</code> in the function on which they are called.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span> () { <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-property">log</span> (<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>, <span class="hljs-variable language_">arguments</span>); }
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> thisArg = {<span class="hljs-attr">myObj</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"is cool"</span>};
foo.<span class="hljs-title function_">call</span>(thisArg, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>This is a typical example of using <code>call</code>. It basically takes the first parameter and sets <code>this</code> in the function <code>foo</code> as a reference to <code>thisArg</code>.  All other parameters passed to <code>call</code> is passed to the function <code>foo</code> as arguments.<br>
So the above code will log <code>{myObj: "is cool"}, [1, 2, 3]</code> in the console. Pretty nice way to change the value of <code>this</code> in any function.</p>

<p><code>apply</code> is almost the same as <code>call</code> accept that it takes only two parameters: <code>thisArg</code> and an array which contains the arguments to be passed to the function. So the above <code>call</code> call can be translated to <code>apply</code> like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">foo.<span class="hljs-title function_">apply</span>(thisArg, [<span class="hljs-number">1</span>,<span class="hljs-number">2</span>,<span class="hljs-number">3</span>])
</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code> can override the value of <code>this</code> set by dot method invocation we discussed in the second bullet.
Simple enough :)</p>

<h2>Presenting.... <code>bind</code>!</h2>

<p><code>bind</code> is a brother of <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code>.  It is also a method inherited by all functions from the global <code>Function</code> constructor in Javascript. The difference between <code>bind</code> and <code>call</code>/<code>apply</code> is that both <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code> will actually invoke the function. <code>bind</code>, on the other hand, returns a new function with the <code>thisArg</code> and <code>arguments</code> pre-set. Let's take an example to better understand this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span> (a, b) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-property">log</span> (<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>, <span class="hljs-variable language_">arguments</span>);
}
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> thisArg = {<span class="hljs-attr">myObj</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"even more cool now"</span>};
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> bound = foo.<span class="hljs-title function_">bind</span>(thisArg, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>);
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-property">log</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span> bound); <span class="hljs-comment">// logs `function`</span>
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-property">log</span> (bound);
<span class="hljs-comment">/* logs `function () { native code }` */</span>

<span class="hljs-title function_">bound</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// calling the function returned by `.bind`</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// logs `{myObj: "even more cool now"}, [1, 2]`</span>
</code></pre>

<p>See the difference between the three? It is subtle, but they are used differently. Like <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code>, <code>bind</code> will also over-ride the value of <code>this</code> set by dot-method invocation.</p>

<p>Also note that neither of these three functions do any change to the original function. <code>call</code> and <code>apply</code> would return the value from freshly constructed functions while <code>bind</code> will return the freshly constructed function itself, ready to be called.</p>

<h2>Extra stuff, copy this</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you don't like the fact that <code>this</code> changes with scope, especially nested scope. Take a look at the following example.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myObj = {
    <span class="hljs-attr">hello</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-string">"world"</span>
        },
    <span class="hljs-attr">myMethod</span>: <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
        <span class="hljs-comment">// copy this, variable names are case-sensitive</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> that = <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>;
        <span class="hljs-comment">// callbacks ftw \o/</span>
        foo.<span class="hljs-title function_">bar</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"args"</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
            <span class="hljs-comment">// I want to call `hello` here</span>
            <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">hello</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// error</span>
            <span class="hljs-comment">// but `this` references to `foo` damn!</span>
            <span class="hljs-comment">// oh wait we have a backup \o/</span>
            that.<span class="hljs-title function_">hello</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// "world"</span>
        });
    }
  };
</code></pre>

<p>In the above code, we see that the value of <code>this</code> changed with the nested scope, but we wanted the value of <code>this</code> from the original scope. So we 'copied' <code>this</code> to <code>that</code> and used the copy instead of <code>this</code>. Clever, eh?</p>

<p>"this" is all about scope. Every function has its own scope, and since everything in JS is an object, even a function can store some values into itself using "this". OOP 101 teaches that "this" is only applicable to <em>instances</em> of an object. Therefore, every-time a function executes, a new "instance" of that function has a new meaning of "this".</p>

<p>Most people get confused when they try to use "this" inside of anonymous closure functions like:</p>

<pre>(function(value) {
    this.value = value;
    $('.some-elements').each(function(elt){
        elt.innerHTML = this.value;        // uh oh!! possibly undefined
    });
})(2);
</pre>

<p>So here, inside each(), "this" doesn't hold the "value" that you expect it to (from </p><pre>this.value = value;</pre> above it). So, to get over this (no pun intended) problem, a developer could:<p></p>

<pre>(function(value) {
    var self = this;            // small change
    self.value = value;
    $('.some-elements').each(function(elt){
        elt.innerHTML = self.value;        // phew!! == 2 
    });
})(2);
</pre>

<p>Try it out; you'll begin to like this pattern of programming</p>

<p><code>this</code> <strong>is not assigned a value</strong> until an object invokes the function where it is defined. In the global scope, all global variables and functions are defined on the <code>window</code> object. Therefore, <code>this</code> in a global function refers to (and has the value of) the global <code>window</code> object. </p>

<p>When <code>use strict</code>, <code>this</code> in global and in anonymous functions that are not bound to any object holds a value of <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>this</code> keyword is <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/#When_this_is_most_misunderstood_and_becomes_tricky" rel="noreferrer">most misunderstood</a> when: 1) we borrow a method that uses <code>this</code>, 2) we assign a method that uses <code>this</code> to a variable, 3) a function that uses <code>this</code> is passed as a callback function, and 4) <code>this</code> is used inside a closure  an inner function. <sup>(2)</sup></p>

<h2>What holds the future</h2>

<p>Defined in <a href="https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read" rel="noreferrer">ECMA Script 6</a>, arrow-functions adopt the <code>this</code> binding from the
enclosing (function or global) scope.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
     <span class="hljs-comment">// return an arrow function</span>

</code></pre>

<p>While arrow-functions provide an alternative to using <code>bind()</code>, its important to note that they essentially are disabling the traditional <code>this</code> mechanism in favor of more widely understood lexical scoping. <sup>(1)</sup></p>

<p><strong>For event handlers:</strong> inline event handlers, such as <code>&lt;element onclick="foo"&gt;</code>, override any other handlers attached earlier and before, so be careful and it's better to stay off of inline event delegation at all.
And thanks to Zara Alaverdyan who inspired me to this list of examples through a dissenting debate :)</p>

<ul>
<li><code>el.onclick = foo; // in the foo - obj</code></li>
<li><code>el.onclick = function () {this.style.color = '#fff';} // obj</code></li>
<li><code>el.onclick = function() {doSomething();} // In the doSomething -
Window</code></li>
<li><code>el.addEventListener('click',foo,false) // in the foo - obj</code></li>
<li><code>el.attachEvent('onclick, function () { // this }') // window, all the
compliance to IE :)</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;button onclick="this.style.color = '#fff';"&gt; // obj</code></li>
<li><code>&lt;button onclick="foo"&gt; // In the foo - window, but you can &lt;button
onclick="foo(this)"&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://bjorn.tipling.com/all-this" rel="noreferrer">Here</a> is one good source of <code>this</code> in <code>JavaScript</code>.</p>

<p>Here is the summary:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>global this</strong></p>

<p>In a browser, at the global scope, <code>this</code> is the <code>window</code>object</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;script type=<span class="hljs-string">"text/javascript"</span>&gt;
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span> === <span class="hljs-variable language_">window</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// true</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> foo = <span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span>;
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">foo</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// "bar"</span>

</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>In <code>node</code> using the repl, <code>this</code> is the top namespace. You can refer to it as <code>global</code>.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&gt;<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>
  { <span class="hljs-title class_">ArrayBuffer</span>: [<span class="hljs-title class_">Function</span>: <span class="hljs-title class_">ArrayBuffer</span>],
    <span class="hljs-title class_">Int8Array</span>: { [<span class="hljs-title class_">Function</span>: <span class="hljs-title class_">Int8Array</span>] <span class="hljs-attr">BYTES_PER_ELEMENT</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span> },
    <span class="hljs-title class_">Uint8Array</span>: { [<span class="hljs-title class_">Function</span>: <span class="hljs-title class_">Uint8Array</span>] <span class="hljs-attr">BYTES_PER_ELEMENT</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span> },
    ...
&gt;<span class="hljs-variable language_">global</span> === <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>
 <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In <code>node</code> executing from a script, <code>this</code> at the global scope starts as an empty object. It is not the same as <code>global</code></p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">\\test.<span class="hljs-property">js</span>
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>);  \\ {}
<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span> === <span class="hljs-variable language_">global</span>); \\ fasle
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>function this</strong></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Except in the case of DOM event handlers or when a <code>thisArg</code> is provided (see further down), both in node and in a browser using <code>this</code> in a function that is not called with <code>new</code> references the global scope</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;script type=<span class="hljs-string">"text/javascript"</span>&gt;
    foo = <span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span>;

    <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">testThis</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
      <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">foo</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>;
    }

    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">foo</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">//logs "bar"</span>

    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">foo</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">//logs "foo"</span>
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you use <code>use strict;</code>, in which case <code>this</code> will be <code>undefined</code></p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;script type=<span class="hljs-string">"text/javascript"</span>&gt;
    foo = <span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span>;

    <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">testThis</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {

      <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">foo</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>;
    }

    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">foo</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">//logs "bar"</span>
    <span class="hljs-title function_">testThis</span>();  <span class="hljs-comment">//Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'foo' of undefined </span>
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you call a function with <code>new</code> the <code>this</code> will be a new context, it will not reference the global <code>this</code>.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;script type=<span class="hljs-string">"text/javascript"</span>&gt;
    foo = <span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span>;

    <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">testThis</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
      <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">foo</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>;
    }

    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">foo</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">//logs "bar"</span>

&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><strong>prototype this</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Functions you create become function objects. They automatically get a special <code>prototype</code> property, which is something you can assign values to. When you create an instance by calling your function with <code>new</code> you get access to the values you assigned to the <code>prototype</code> property. You access those values using <code>this</code>.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">Thing</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">foo</span>);
}

<span class="hljs-title class_">Thing</span>.<span class="hljs-property"><span class="hljs-keyword">prototype</span></span>.<span class="hljs-property">foo</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span>;

<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(thing.<span class="hljs-property">foo</span>);  <span class="hljs-comment">//logs "bar"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>It is usually a mistake to assign <em>arrays</em> or <em>objects</em> on the <code>prototype</code>. If you want instances to each have their own arrays, create them in the function, not the prototype.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">Thing</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {

</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><strong>object this</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You can use <code>this</code> in any function on an object to refer to other properties on that object. This is not the same as an instance created with <code>new</code>.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> obj = {
    <span class="hljs-attr">foo</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span>,

<ul>
<li><strong>DOM event this</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In an HTML DOM event handler, <code>this</code> is always a reference to the DOM element the event was attached to </p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">Listener</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {

<ul>
<li><strong>HTML this</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Inside HTML attributes in which you can put JavaScript, <code>this</code> is a reference to the element. </p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;div id=<span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span> onclick=<span class="hljs-string">"console.log(this);"</span>&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<p>There is a lot of confusion regarding how <strong>"this"</strong> keyword is interpreted in JavaScript. Hopefully this article will lay all those to rest once and for all. And a lot more. Please read the entire article carefully. Be forewarned that this article is long.</p>

<p>Irrespective of the context in which it is used, <strong>"this"</strong> always references the <strong>"current object"</strong> in Javascript. However, what the <strong>"current object"</strong> is  differs according to <strong>context</strong>. The <strong>context</strong> may be exactly <strong>1 of the 6</strong> following:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Global</strong> (i.e. Outside all functions)</li>
<li><strong>Inside Direct "Non Bound Function" Call</strong> (i.e. a function that has <strong>not been</strong> bound by calling <strong><em>functionName.bind</em></strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Inside Indirect "Non Bound Function" Call</strong> through <strong><em>functionName.call</em></strong> and <strong><em>functionName.apply</em></strong></li>
<li><strong>Inside "Bound Function" Call</strong> (i.e. a function that <strong>has been bound</strong> by calling <strong><em>functionName.bind</em></strong>)</li>
<li><strong>While Object Creation through "new"</strong></li>
<li><strong>Inside Inline DOM event handler</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>The following describes each of this contexts one by one:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Global Context</strong> (i.e. Outside all functions):</p>

<p>Outside all functions (i.e. in global context) the <strong>"current
object"</strong> (and hence the value of <strong>"this"</strong>) is always the
<strong>"window"</strong> object for browsers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inside Direct "Non Bound Function" Call</strong>: </p>

<p>Inside a Direct  "Non Bound Function" Call, <strong>the object that
invoked the function call becomes the "current object"</strong> (and hence
the value of <strong>"this"</strong>). If a function is called without a explicit <strong>current object</strong>, the <strong>current object</strong> is either the <strong>"window"</strong> object (For Non Strict Mode) or <strong>undefined</strong> (For Strict Mode)  . Any function (or variable) defined in
<strong>Global Context</strong> automatically becomes a property of the <strong>"window"</strong> object.For e.g Suppose function is defined in Global Context as </p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">UserDefinedFunction</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
    <span class="hljs-title function_">alert</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>)
    }
</code></pre>

<p>it becomes the property of the window object, as if you have defined
it as</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-variable language_">window</span>.<span class="hljs-property">UserDefinedFunction</span>=<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
  <span class="hljs-title function_">alert</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>)
}  
</code></pre>

<p>In "Non Strict Mode", Calling/Invoking this function directly through   <strong>"UserDefinedFunction()"</strong> will automatically call/invoke
it as <strong>"window.UserDefinedFunction()"</strong> making <strong>"window"</strong> as the
<strong>"current object"</strong> (and hence the value of <strong>"this"</strong>) within <strong>"UserDefinedFunction"</strong>.Invoking this function in "Non Strict Mode" will result in the following</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title class_">UserDefinedFunction</span>() <span class="hljs-comment">// displays [object Window]  as it automatically gets invoked as window.UserDefinedFunction()</span>
</code></pre>

<p>In "Strict Mode", Calling/Invoking the function directly through
<strong>"UserDefinedFunction()"</strong> will <strong>"NOT"</strong> automatically call/invoke it as <strong>"window.UserDefinedFunction()"</strong>.Hence the <strong>"current
object"</strong> (and the value of <strong>"this"</strong>) within
<strong>"UserDefinedFunction"</strong> shall be <strong>undefined</strong>. Invoking this function in "Strict Mode" will result in the following</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title class_">UserDefinedFunction</span>() <span class="hljs-comment">// displays undefined</span>
</code></pre>

<p>However, invoking it explicitly using window object shall result in
the following</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-variable language_">window</span>.<span class="hljs-title class_">UserDefinedFunction</span>() <span class="hljs-comment">// "always displays [object Window]   irrespective of mode."</span>

<p>As given in the code above, <strong>"this" value for any "Bound Function"
CANNOT be altered through call/apply</strong>. Also, if the <strong>"this"</strong>
parameter is  not explicitly passed to bind, <strong>"current object"</strong>
(and hence the value of <strong>"this"</strong> ) is set to <strong>"window"</strong> in Non
strict mode and <strong>"undefined"</strong> in strict mode.  One more thing.
Binding an already bound function does not change the value of <strong>"this"</strong>.
It remains set as the value set by first bind function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>While Object Creation through "new"</strong>:</p>

<p>Inside a constructor function, the <strong>"current object"</strong> (and hence the value of 
<strong>"this"</strong>) references the object that is currently being created
through <strong>"new"</strong> irrespective of the bind status of the function. However
if the constructor is a bound function it shall get called with 
predefined set of arguments as set for the bound function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inside Inline DOM event handler</strong>:</p>

<p>Please look at the following HTML Snippet</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;button onclick=<span class="hljs-string">'this.style.color=white'</span>&gt;<span class="hljs-title class_">Hello</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">World</span>&lt;/button&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>"this"</strong> in above examples refer to "button" element and the
"div" element respectively.</p>

<p>In the first example, the font color of the button shall be set to
white when it is clicked.</p>

<p>In the second example when the <strong>"div"</strong> element is clicked it shall
call the <strong>OnDivClick</strong> function with its second parameter
referencing the clicked div element. However the value of <strong>"this"</strong>
within OnDivClick <strong>SHALL NOT</strong> reference the clicked <strong>div</strong>
element. It shall be set as the <strong>"window object"</strong> or
<strong>"undefined"</strong> in <strong>Non strict</strong> and <strong>Strict Modes</strong> respectively (if <strong>OnDivClick</strong> is an <strong>unbound function</strong>) or set to a predefined
Bound value (if <strong>OnDivClick</strong> is a <strong>bound function</strong>)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The following summarizes the entire article</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In Global Context <strong>"this"</strong> always refers to the <strong>"window"</strong> object</p></li>
<li><p>Whenever a function is invoked, it is invoked in context of an
object (<strong>"current object"</strong>). If the <strong>current object</strong> is not explicitly provided,
the <strong>current object</strong>  is the <strong>"window object"</strong> in <strong>NON Strict
Mode</strong> and <strong>"undefined"</strong> in Strict Mode by default.</p></li>
<li><p>The value of <strong>"this"</strong> within a Non Bound function is the reference to object in context of which the function is invoked (<strong>"current object"</strong>)</p></li>
<li><p>The value of <strong>"this"</strong> within a Non Bound function can be overriden by
<strong>call</strong> and <strong>apply</strong> methods of the function.</p></li>
<li><p>The value of <strong>"this"</strong> is fixed for a Bound function and cannot be
overriden by <strong>call</strong> and <strong>apply</strong> methods of the function.</p></li>
<li><p>Binding and already bound function does not change the value of "this". It remains set as the value set by first bind function.</p></li>
<li><p>The value of <strong>"this"</strong> within a constructor is the object that is being
created and initialized</p></li>
<li><p>The value of <strong>"this"</strong> within an inline DOM event handler is reference

<p>Probably the most detailed and comprehensive article on <code>this</code> is the following: </p>

<p><a href="https://dmitripavlutin.com/gentle-explanation-of-this-in-javascript/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Gentle explanation of 'this' keyword in JavaScript</a></p>

<p>The idea behind <code>this</code> is to understand that the function invocation types have the significant importance on setting <code>this</code> value.  </p>

<hr>

<p>When having troubles identifying <code>this</code>, <strong>do not</strong> ask yourself:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where is <em><code>this</code> taken from</em>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but <strong>do</strong> ask yourself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How is the function <em>invoked</em>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For an arrow function (special case of context transparency) ask yourself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What value has <code>this</code> where the arrow function is <em>defined</em>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This mindset is correct when dealing with <code>this</code> and will save you from headache.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <em>this</em> reference ALWAYS refers to (and holds the value of) an
  objecta singular objectand it is usually used inside a function or a
  method, although it can be used outside a function in the global
  scope. Note that when we use strict mode, this holds the value of
  undefined in global functions and in anonymous functions that are not
  bound to any object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are Four Scenarios where <em>this</em> can be confusing:</p>

<ol>
<li>When we pass a method (that uses <em>this</em>) as an argument to be used as a callback function. </li>
<li>When we use an inner function (a closure). It is important to take note that closures cannot access the outer functions <em>this</em> variable by using the this keyword because the this variable is accessible only by the function itself, not by inner functions.</li>
<li>When a method which relies on <em>this</em> is assigned to a variable across contexts, in which case <em>this</em> references another object than originally intended.</li>
<li>When using <em>this</em> along with the bind, apply, and call methods.</li>
</ol>

<p><code>this</code> is one of the misunderstood concept in JavaScript because it behaves little differently from place to place. Simply, <code>this</code> refers to the <strong>"owner" of the function we are currently executing</strong>. </p>

<p>The value of "this" depends on the "context" in which the function is executed. The context can be any object or the global object, i.e., window.</p>

<p>So the Semantic of "this" is different from the traditional OOP languages. And it causes problems:
1. when a function is passed to another variable (most likely, a callback); and 2. when a closure is invoked from a member method of a class.</p>

<p>In both cases, this is set to window.</p>

<p>In pseudoclassical terms, the way many lectures teach the 'this' keyword is as an object instantiated by a class or object constructor.

<p>I have a different take on <code>this</code> from the other answers that I hope is helpful.</p>

<p>One way to look at JavaScript is to see that there are only 1 way to call a function<sup>1</sup>. It is</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">functionObject.<span class="hljs-title function_">call</span>(objectForThis, arg0, arg1, arg2, ...);
</code></pre>

<p>There is always some value supplied for <code>objectForThis</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Everything else is syntactic sugar for <code>functionObject.call</code></strong></p>

<p>So, everything else can be described by how it translates into <code>functionObject.call</code>.</p>

<p>If you just call a function then <code>this</code> is the "global object" which in the browser is the window</p>

<p>In JavaScript there are operators like <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> and <code>*</code>. There is also the dot operator which is <code>.</code></p>

<p>The <code>.</code> operator when used with a function on the right and an object on the left effectively means "pass object as <code>this</code> to function.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In other words <code>bar.foo()</code> translates into <code>const temp = bar.foo; temp.call(bar);</code></p>

<p>Note that it doesn't matter how the function was created (mostly...). All of these will produce the same results</p>

<p></p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">

<p></p>

<p>Again these all are just syntactic sugar for</p>

{ <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> temp = bar.<span class="hljs-property">fn3</span>; temp.<span class="hljs-title function_">call</span>(bar); }
</code></pre>

<p>One other wrinkle is the prototype chain. When you use <code>a.b</code> JavaScript first looks on the object referenced directly by <code>a</code> for the property <code>b</code>. If <code>b</code> is not found on the object then JavaScript will look in the object's prototype to find <code>b</code>. </p>

<p>There are various ways to define an object's prototype, the most common in 2019 is the <code>class</code> keyword. For the purposes of <code>this</code> though it doesn't matter. What matters is that as it looks in object <code>a</code> for property <code>b</code> if it finds property <code>b</code> on the object or in it's prototype chain if <code>b</code> ends up being a function then the same rules as above apply. The function <code>b</code> references will be called using the <code>call</code> method and passing <code>a</code> as objectForThis as shown a the top of this answer.</p>

<p>Now. Let's imagine we make a function that explicitly sets <code>this</code> before calling another function and then call it with the <code>.</code> (dot) operator</p>

<p></p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">

  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>);
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">bar</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {

  foo.<span class="hljs-title function_">call</span>(objectForThis);  <span class="hljs-comment">// explicitly passing objectForThis</span>
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> obj = {
  bar,
};

obj.<span class="hljs-title function_">bar</span>();  </code></pre>
<div class="snippet-result"><div class="snippet-ctas"><button type="button" class="s-btn s-btn__primary"><span class="icon-play-white _hover"></span><span> Run code snippet</span></button><input class="copySnippet s-btn s-btn__filled" type="button" value="Copy snippet to answer" style="display: none;"><button type="button" class="s-btn hideResults" style="display: none;">Hide results</button><div class="popout-code"><a class="snippet-expand-link">Expand snippet</a></div></div><div class="snippet-result-code" style="display: none;"><iframe name="sif10" sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-scripts" class="snippet-box-edit snippet-box-result" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></div></div>
</div>
<p></p>

<p>Following the translation to use <code>call</code>, <code>obj.bar()</code> becomes <code>const temp = obj.bar; temp.call(obj);</code>. When we enter the <code>bar</code> function we call <code>foo</code> but we explicitly passed in another object for objectForThis so when we arrive at foo <code>this</code> is that inner object.</p>

<p>This is what both <code>bind</code> and <code>=&gt;</code> functions effectively do. They are more syntactic sugar. They effectively build a new invisible function exactly like <code>bar</code> above that explicitly sets <code>this</code> before it calls whatever function is specified. In the case of bind <code>this</code> is set to whatever you pass to <code>bind</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note that if <code>functionObject.bind</code> did not exist we could make our own like this</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">bind</span>(<span class="hljs-params">fn, objectForThis</span>) {

    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> fn.<span class="hljs-title function_">call</span>(objectForthis, ...args);
  };
}

<p>and then we could call it like this</p>

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> bar = <span class="hljs-title function_">bind</span>(foo, {<span class="hljs-attr">name</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'abc'</span>});

<p>Arrow functions, the <code>=&gt;</code> operator are syntactic sugar for bind</p>

<p>Just like <code>bind</code>, a new invisible function is created that calls the given function with a bound value for <code>objectForThis</code> but unlike <code>bind</code> the object to be bound is implicit.

<p><code>obj.foo()</code> translates to <code>const temp = obj.foo; temp.call(obj);</code> which means the arrow operator inside <code>foo</code> will bind <code>obj</code> to a new invisible function and return that new invisible function which is assigned to <code>b</code>. <code>b()</code> will work as it always has as <code>b.call(window)</code> or <code>b.call(undefined)</code> calling the new invisible function that <code>foo</code> created. That invisible function ignores the <code>this</code> passed into it and  passes <code>obj</code> as objectForThis` to the arrow function.</p>

<p>The code above translates to</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {

<h2>Summary <code>this</code> Javascript:</h2>

<ul>
<li>The value of <code>this</code> is determined by <strong>how the function is invoked not, where it was created!</strong></li>
<li>Usually the value of <code>this</code> is determined by the Object which is left of the dot. (<code>window</code> in global space)</li>
<li>In event listeners the value of <code>this</code>  refers to the DOM element on which the event was called.</li>
<li>When in function is called with the <code>new</code> keyword the value of <code>this</code> refers to the newly created object</li>
<li>You can manipulate the value of <code>this</code> with the functions: <code>call</code>, <code>apply</code>, <code>bind</code></li>
</ul>

<p>"this" in JavaScript
this is one of the properties of the Execution Context.
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jiAdn.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/jiAdn.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>this property is created every time a function is executed and not
before that.</li>
<li>Its value is not static but rather depends on how it is being used.</li>
<li>takes a value that points to the owner of the function in which it is
used</li>
</ul>
<p>There are different ways in which the "this" keyword can be used, below are the example for it (method, regular function, arrow function, Event listener, Explicit function Binding).</p>
<p><strong>1. Inside a method.</strong></p>
<p>this === (to the object that is calling the Method).</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SAtWz.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/SAtWz.png" alt="enter image description here"></a>
In the above example the method " fullName()" is called by an Object "person" hence the value of this inside the method " fullName()" will be equal to the "person" Object.</p>
<p><strong>2. Inside a Function.</strong></p>
<p>i) function declaration/expression</p>
<p>in loose mode this === window (object)
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5E55o.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/5E55o.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>in Strict mode this === undefined
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AGWJ4.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/AGWJ4.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>Note&nbsp;: this property works the same while defining a function using function declaration or function expression approach.</p>
<p>ii) Arrow Function&nbsp;:</p>
<p>Arrow Function does not have their own this property, they take the value of this as their surrounding Function.
If the surrounding function is not present i.e if they are defined at the global level then this === window (object)</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9NPIK.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/9NPIK.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
<p><strong>3. Event Listener</strong>
this === object on which the handler is attached.
click event bind to the Document&nbsp;object</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y6elH.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y6elH.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>In the above example since the click handler is attached to the "document" object, this will be equal to the "document" object</p>
<p><strong>4. Explicit Function Binding (call, Apply, Bind)</strong></p>
<p>The call() and apply() methods are predefined JavaScript methods.</p>
<p>They can both be used to call an object method with another object as an argument.</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IPfrH.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/IPfrH.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>In the above example this inside the "printFullDetails()" is explicitly set to the personObj1 and personObj2 by passing as the first argument to call method.</p>
<p>You can Explore more about call, apply and bind methods <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15455009/javascript-call-apply-vs-bind/62058682#62058682">here</a>.</p>

<p>To understand "this" properly one must understand the context and scope and difference between them.</p>

<p><strong>Scope</strong>: In javascript scope is related to the visibility of the variables, scope achieves through the use of the function. (Read more about scope)</p>

<p><strong>Context</strong>: Context is related to objects. It refers to the object to which a function belongs. When you use the JavaScript this keyword, it refers to the object to which function belongs. <strong>For example, inside of a function, when you say: this.accoutNumber, you are referring to the property accoutNumber, that belongs to the object to which that function belongs.</strong> </p>

<p>If the object myObj has a method called getMyName, when the JavaScript keyword this is used inside of getMyName, it refers to myObj. If the function getMyName were executed in the global scope, then this refers to the window object (except in strict mode). </p>

<p>Now let's see some example:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">    &lt;script&gt;
        <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'What is this: '</span>+<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>);
        <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>);
    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Runnig abobve code in browser output will:
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zO7hd.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/zO7hd.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>According to the output you are inside of the context of the window object, it is also visible that window prototype refers to the Object.</p>

<p>Now let's try inside of a function:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">    &lt;script&gt;
        <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">myFunc</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
            <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'What is this: '</span>+<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>);
            <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>);
        }
        <span class="hljs-title function_">myFunc</span>();
    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ciuzi.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ciuzi.png" alt="enter image description here"></a>
The output is the same because we logged 'this' variable in the global scope and we logged it in functional scope, we didn't change the context. In both case context was same, related to <strong>widow object</strong>. </p>

<p>Now let's create our own object. In javascript, you can create an object in many ways.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"> &lt;script&gt;
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> firstName = <span class="hljs-string">"Nora"</span>;
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> lastName = <span class="hljs-string">"Zaman"</span>;
        <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> myObj = {
            <span class="hljs-attr">firstName</span>:<span class="hljs-string">"Lord"</span>,
            <span class="hljs-attr">lastName</span>:<span class="hljs-string">'Baron'</span>,
            <span class="hljs-attr">printNameGetContext</span>:<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
                <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(firstName + <span class="hljs-string">" "</span>+lastName);
                <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">firstName</span> +<span class="hljs-string">" "</span>+<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">lastName</span>);
                <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>;
            }
        }

      <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> context = myObj.<span class="hljs-title function_">printNameGetContext</span>();
      <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(context);
    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Output: 
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4JxJF.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/4JxJF.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>So from the above example, we found that 'this' keyword is referring to a new context that is related to myObj, and myObject also has prototype chain to Object.</p>

<p>Let's go throw another example:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">&lt;body&gt;
    <span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">button</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"btn"</span>&gt;</span>Click Me<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">button</span>&gt;</span></span>
    <span class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span><span class="language-javascript">
        <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">printMe</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
            <span class="hljs-comment">//Terminal2: this function declared inside window context so this function belongs to the window object.</span>
            <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>);
        }
        <span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">querySelector</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'.btn'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">addEventListener</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
            <span class="hljs-comment">//Terminal1: button context, this callback function belongs to DOM element </span>
            <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>);
            <span class="hljs-title function_">printMe</span>();
        })
    </span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>&gt;</span></span>
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>output: 
Make sense right? (read comments)

What matters is that as it looks in object \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;a\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; for property \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;b\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; if it finds property \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;b\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; on the object or in it\u0026apos;s prototype chain if \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;b\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; ends up being a function then the same rules as above apply. The function \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;b\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; references will be called using the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;call\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; method and passing \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;a\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; as objectForThis as shown a the top of this answer.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now.
