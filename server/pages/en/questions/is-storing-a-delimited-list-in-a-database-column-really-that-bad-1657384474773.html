<p>There are times when you need to employ denormalization, but as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3653507/578288">@OMG Ponies mentions</a>, these are exception cases.  Any non-relational optimization benefits one type of query at the expense of other uses of the data, so be sure you know which of your queries need to be treated so specially that they deserve denormalization.</p>

<p>A second criticism is that putting raw input results directly into a database, without any validation or binding at all, leaves you open to SQL injection attacks.</p>

<p>I needed a multi-value column, it could be implemented as an xml field</p>

<p>It could be converted to a comma delimited as necessary</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6097849/querying-an-xml-list-in-sql-server-using-xquery">querying an XML list in sql server using Xquery</a>.</p>

<p>By being an xml field, some of the concerns can be addressed.</p>

<p><strong>With CSV:</strong> Can't ensure that each value is the right data type: no way to prevent 1,2,3,banana,5</p>

<p><strong>With XML:</strong> values in a tag can be forced to be the correct type</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>With CSV:</strong> Can't use foreign key constraints to link values to a lookup table; no way to enforce referential integrity.</p>

<p><strong>With XML:</strong> still an issue</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>With CSV:</strong> Can't enforce uniqueness: no way to prevent 1,2,3,3,3,5</p>

<p><strong>With XML:</strong> still an issue</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>With CSV:</strong> Can't delete a value from the list without fetching the whole list.</p>

<p><strong>With XML:</strong> single items can be removed</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>With CSV:</strong> Hard to search for all entities with a given value in the list; you have to use an inefficient table-scan.</p>

<p><strong>With XML:</strong> xml field can be indexed</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>With CSV:</strong> Hard to count elements in the list, or do other aggregate queries.**</p>

<p><strong>With XML:</strong> not particularly hard </p>

<p><strong>With CSV:</strong> Hard to join the values to the lookup table they reference.**</p>

<p><strong>With XML:</strong> not particularly hard </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>With CSV:</strong> Hard to fetch the list in sorted order.</p>

<p><strong>With XML:</strong> not particularly hard </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>With CSV:</strong> Storing integers as strings takes about twice as much space as storing binary integers.</p>

<p><strong>With XML:</strong> storage is even worse than a csv </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>With CSV:</strong> Plus a lot of comma characters.</p>

<p><strong>With XML:</strong> tags are used instead of commas</p>

<hr>

<p>In short, using XML gets around some of the issues with delimited list AND can be converted to a delimited list as needed</p>

<p>Well I've been using a key/value pair tab separated list in a NTEXT column in SQL Server for more than 4 years now and it works.

<p>I would probably take the middle ground: make each field in the CSV into a separate column in the database, but not worry much about normalization (at least for now). At some point, normalization <em>might</em> become interesting, but with all the data shoved into a single column you're gaining virtually no benefit from using a database at all. You need to separate the data into logical fields/columns/whatever you want to call them before you can manipulate it meaningfully at all.</p>
