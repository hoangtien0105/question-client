<p>There are numerous questions on SO asking:</p>

<li>how to get a count of specific values from the comma separated list</li>
<li>how to get records that have only the same 2/3/etc specific value from that comma separated list</li>

<p>It breaks first normal form.</p>

<p>A second criticism is that putting raw input results directly into a database, without any validation or binding at all, leaves you open to SQL injection attacks.</p>

<p>I needed a multi-value column, it could be implemented as an xml field</p>

<p>It could be converted to a comma delimited as necessary</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6097849/querying-an-xml-list-in-sql-server-using-xquery">querying an XML list in sql server using Xquery</a>.</p>

<p>By being an xml field, some of the concerns can be addressed.</p>

<p><strong>With CSV:</strong> Can't ensure that each value is the right data type: no way to prevent 1,2,3,banana,5</p>

<p><strong>With XML:</strong> values in a tag can be forced to be the correct type</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>With CSV:</strong> Can't use foreign key constraints to link values to a lookup table; no way to enforce referential integrity.</p>

<p><strong>With XML:</strong> still an issue</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>With CSV:</strong> Can't enforce uniqueness: no way to prevent 1,2,3,3,3,5</p>

<p><strong>With XML:</strong> still an issue</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>With CSV:</strong> Can't delete a value from the list without fetching the whole list.</p>

<p><strong>With XML:</strong> single items can be removed</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>With CSV:</strong> Hard to search for all entities with a given value in the list; you have to use an inefficient table-scan.</p>

<p><strong>With XML:</strong> xml field can be indexed</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>With CSV:</strong> Hard to count elements in the list, or do other aggregate queries.**</p>

<p><strong>With XML:</strong> not particularly hard </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>With CSV:</strong> Hard to join the values to the lookup table they reference.**</p>

<p><strong>With XML:</strong> not particularly hard </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>With CSV:</strong> Hard to fetch the list in sorted order.</p>

<p><strong>With XML:</strong> not particularly hard </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>With CSV:</strong> Storing integers as strings takes about twice as much space as storing binary integers.</p>

<p><strong>With XML:</strong> storage is even worse than a csv </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>With CSV:</strong> Plus a lot of comma characters.</p>

<p><strong>With XML:</strong> tags are used instead of commas</p>

<hr>

<p>In short, using XML gets around some of the issues with delimited list AND can be converted to a delimited list as needed</p>

<p>Well I've been using a key/value pair tab separated list in a NTEXT column in SQL Server for more than 4 years now and it works.

<p>I would probably take the middle ground: make each field in the CSV into a separate column in the database, but not worry much about normalization (at least for now). At some point, normalization <em>might</em> become interesting, but with all the data shoved into a single column you're gaining virtually no benefit from using a database at all. You need to separate the data into logical fields/columns/whatever you want to call them before you can manipulate it meaningfully at all.</p>
