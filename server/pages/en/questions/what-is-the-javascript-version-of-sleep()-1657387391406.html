All other answers are now obsolete or overly complicated. Here is the current best practice:\nfunction sleep(ms) {\n    return new Promise(resolve =&gt; setTimeout(resolve, ms));\n}\n\nOr as a one-liner:\nawait new Promise(r =&gt; setTimeout(r, 2000));\n\nOr\nconst sleep = ms =&gt; new Promise(r =&gt; setTimeout(r, ms));\n\nUse it as:\nawait sleep(&lt;duration&gt;);\n\nDemo:\n\n\nfunction sleep(ms) {\n    return new Promise(resolve =&gt; setTimeout(resolve, ms));\n}\n\nasync function demo() {\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {\n        console.log(`Waiting ${i} seconds...`);\n        await sleep(i * 1000);\n    }\n    console.log(&apos;Done&apos;);\n}\n\ndemo();\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\nNote that,\n\nawait can only be executed in functions prefixed with the async keyword, or at the top level of your script in an increasing number of environments.\nawait only pauses the current async function. This means it does not block the execution of the rest of the script, which is what you want in the vast majority of the cases. If you do want a blocking construct, see this answer using Atomics.wait, but note that most browsers will not allow it on the browser&apos;s main thread.\n\nTwo new JavaScript features (as of 2017) helped write this &quot;sleep&quot; function:\n\nPromises, a native feature of ES2015 (aka ES6). We also use arrow functions in the definition of the sleep function.\nThe async/await feature lets the code explicitly wait for a promise to settle (resolve or reject).\n\nCompatibility\n\npromises are supported in Node v0.12+ and widely supported in browsers, except IE\nasync/await landed in V8 and has been enabled by default since Chrome 55 (released in Dec 2016)\n\nit landed in Node 7 in October 2016\nand also landed in Firefox Nightly in November 2016\n\n\n\nIf for some reason you&apos;re using Node older than 7 (which reached end of life in 2017), or are targeting old browsers, async/await can still be used via Babel (a tool that will transpile JavaScript + new features into plain old JavaScript), with the transform-async-to-generator plugin.\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/what-is-the-javascript-version-of-sleep()-1657387391406#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"(See the updated answer for 2016)\nI think it&apos;s perfectly reasonable to want to perform an action, wait, and then perform another action. If you are used to writing in multi-threaded languages, you probably have the idea of yielding execution for a set amount of time until your thread wakes up.\nThe issue here is that JavaScript is a single-thread event-based model. While in a specific case, it might be nice to have the whole engine wait for a few seconds, in general it is bad practice. Suppose I wanted to make use of your functions while writing my own? When I called your method, my methods would all freeze up. If JavaScript could somehow preserve your function&apos;s execution context, store it somewhere, then bring it back and continue later, then sleep could happen, but that would basically be threading.\nSo you are pretty much stuck with what others have suggested -- you&apos;ll need to break your code up into multiple functions.\nYour question is a bit of a false choice, then.

Some will say that there should always be a signal or callback to fire a given functionality, others will argue that sometimes an arbitrary moment of delay is useful.  I say that to each their own and one rule can never dictate anything in this industry.\n\nWriting a sleep function is simple and made even more usable with JavaScript Promises:\n\n// sleep time expects milliseconds\nfunction sleep (time) {\n  return new Promise((resolve) =&gt; setTimeout(resolve, time));\n}\n\n// Usage!\nsleep(500).then(() =&gt; {\n    // Do something after the sleep!\n});\n\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/what-is-the-javascript-version-of-sleep()-1657387391406#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"In Firebug (and probably other JavaScript consoles), nothing happen after hitting enter, only after the sleep duration specified (...)\nfunction sleepFor(sleepDuration){\n    var now = new Date().getTime();\n    while(new Date().getTime() &lt; now + sleepDuration){ /* Do nothing */ }\n}\n\nExample of use:\n\n\nfunction sleepFor(sleepDuration){\n    var now = new Date().getTime();\n    while(new Date().getTime() &lt; now + sleepDuration){ \n        /* Do nothing */ \n    }\n}\n\nfunction sleepThenAct(){\n    sleepFor(2000);\n    console.log(&quot;Hello, JavaScript sleep!&quot;);\n}\n\nsleepThenAct()\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\nNote: Only for debugging and development\n    ","url":"https://solutionschecker.com/questions/what-is-the-javascript-version-of-sleep()-1657387391406#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I agree with the other posters. A busy sleep is just a bad idea.\nHowever, setTimeout does not hold up execution.

I&apos;ve tested it in Firefox and Internet Explorer and it doesn&apos;t lock the computer, chew up resources, or cause endless server hits. It seems like a clean solution to me.\nFirst you have to get Java loaded up on the page and make its methods available. To do that, I did this:\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n\n&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n\n  function load() {\n    var appletRef = document.getElementById(&quot;app&quot;);\n    window.java = appletRef.Packages.java;\n  } // endfunction\n\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;body onLoad=&quot;load()&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;embed id=&quot;app&quot; code=&quot;java.applet.Applet&quot; type=&quot;application/x-java-applet&quot; MAYSCRIPT=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;\n\nThen, all you have to do when you want a painless pause in your JavaScript code is:\njava.lang.Thread.sleep(xxx)\n\nWhere xxx is time in milliseconds. In my case (by way of justification), this was part of back-end order fulfilment at a very small company and I needed to print an invoice that had to be loaded from the server. I did it by loading the invoice (as a webpage) into an iFrame and then printing the iFrame.\nOf course, I had to wait until the page was fully loaded before I could print, so the JavaScript code had to pause. I accomplished this by having the invoice page (in the iFrame) change a hidden form field on the parent page with the onLoad event.  And the code on the parent page to print the invoice looked like this (irrelevant parts cut for clarity):\nvar isReady = eval(&apos;document.batchForm.ready&apos;);\nisReady.value = 0;\n\nframes[&apos;rpc_frame&apos;].location.href = url;\n\nwhile (isReady.value == 0) {\n  java.lang.Thread.sleep(250);\n} // endwhile\n\nwindow.frames[&apos;rpc_frame&apos;].focus();\nwindow.frames[&apos;rpc_frame&apos;].print();\n\nSo the user pushes the button, the script loads the invoice page, waits, checking every quarter second to see if the invoice page is finished loading, and pops up the print dialog for the user to send it to the printer.

<h2>2017  2021 update</h2>
<p>Since 2009 when this question was asked, JavaScript has evolved significantly. All other answers are now obsolete or overly complicated. Here is the current best practice:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">sleep</span>(<span class="hljs-params">ms</span>) {

}
</code></pre>
<p>Or as a one-liner:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Promise</span>(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">r</span> =&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">setTimeout</span>(r, <span class="hljs-number">2000</span>));

<p>Or</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">sleep</span> = ms =&gt; <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Promise</span>(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">r</span> =&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">setTimeout</span>(r, ms));
</code></pre>
<p>Use it as:</p>

<p>Note that,</p>
<ol>
<li><code>await</code> can only be executed in functions prefixed with the <code>async</code> keyword, or at the top level of your script in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46515764/how-can-i-use-async-await-at-the-top-level/56590390#56590390">an increasing number of environments</a>.</li>
<li><code>await</code> only pauses the current <code>async</code> function. This means it does not block the execution of the rest of the script, which is what you want in the vast majority of the cases. If you do want a blocking construct, see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/951021/what-is-the-javascript-version-of-sleep/56406126#56406126">this answer</a> using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Atomics" rel="noreferrer"><code>Atomics</code></a><code>.wait</code>, but note that most browsers will not allow it on the browser's main thread.</li>
</ol>
<p>Two new JavaScript features (as of 2017) helped write this "sleep" function:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-promises-in-depth" rel="noreferrer">Promises, a native feature of ES2015</a> (aka ES6). We also use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions" rel="noreferrer">arrow functions</a> in the definition of the sleep function.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/understanding-javascript-async-await" rel="noreferrer"><code>async/await</code></a> feature lets the code explicitly wait for a promise to settle (resolve or reject).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<ul>
<li>promises are supported <a href="http://node.green/#Promise" rel="noreferrer">in Node v0.12+</a> and <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=promises" rel="noreferrer">widely supported in browsers</a>, except IE</li>
<li><code>async</code>/<code>await</code> landed in V8 and has been <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/async-functions" rel="noreferrer">enabled by default since Chrome 55</a> (released in Dec 2016)
<ul>
<li>it landed <a href="https://blog.risingstack.com/async-await-node-js-7-nightly/" rel="noreferrer">in Node 7 in October 2016</a></li>
<li>and also landed <a href="https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/2016/11/01/async-await-support-in-firefox/" rel="noreferrer">in Firefox Nightly in November 2016</a></li>

<p>If for some reason you're using Node older than 7 (which reached <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/Release#end-of-life-releases" rel="noreferrer">end of life in 2017</a>), or are targeting old browsers, <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> can still be used via <a href="https://babeljs.io/" rel="noreferrer">Babel</a> (a tool that will <a href="https://www.stevefenton.co.uk/2012/11/compiling-vs-transpiling/" rel="noreferrer">transpile</a> JavaScript + new features into plain old JavaScript), with the <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-async-to-generator" rel="noreferrer"><code>transform-async-to-generator</code></a> plugin.</p>

<p>I think it's perfectly reasonable to want to perform an action, wait, and then perform another action. If you are used to writing in multi-threaded languages, you probably have the idea of yielding execution for a set amount of time until your thread wakes up.</p>
<p>The issue here is that JavaScript is a single-thread event-based model. While in a specific case, it might be nice to have the whole engine wait for a few seconds, in general it is bad practice. Suppose I wanted to make use of your functions while writing my own? When I called your method, my methods would all freeze up. If JavaScript could somehow preserve your function's execution context, store it somewhere, then bring it back and continue later, then sleep could happen, but that would basically be threading.</p>
<p>So you are pretty much stuck with what others have suggested -- you'll need to break your code up into multiple functions.</p>
<p>Your question is a bit of a false choice, then. There is no way to sleep in the way you want, nor should you pursue the solution you suggest.</p>

<p>In JavaScript, I rewrite every function so that it can end as soon as possible. You want the browser back in control so it can make your DOM changes.</p>

<p>Every time I've wanted a sleep in the middle of my function, I refactored to use a <code>setTimeout()</code>.</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>The infamous sleep, or delay, function within any language is much debated.  Some will say that there should always be a signal or callback to fire a given functionality, others will argue that sometimes an arbitrary moment of delay is useful.  I say that to each their own and one rule can never dictate anything in this industry.</p>

<p>Writing a sleep function is simple and made even more usable with JavaScript Promises:</p>

<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">sleep</span> (time) {

<p>I agree with the other posters. A busy sleep is just a bad idea.</p>
<p>However, setTimeout does not hold up execution. It executes the next line of the function immediately after the timeout is SET, not after the timeout expires, so that does not accomplish the same task that a sleep would accomplish.</p>
<p>The way to do it is to breakdown your function into before and after parts.</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">doStuff</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>)
{
  <span class="hljs-comment">// Do some things</span>
  <span class="hljs-built_in">setTimeout</span>(continueExecution, <span class="hljs-number">10000</span>) <span class="hljs-comment">// Wait ten seconds before continuing</span>
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">continueExecution</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>)
{
   <span class="hljs-comment">// Finish doing things after the pause</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure your function names still accurately describe what each piece is doing (i.e., GatherInputThenWait and CheckInput, rather than funcPart1 and funcPart2)</p>
<p>This method achieves the purpose of not executing the lines of code you decide until <em>after</em> your timeout, while still returning control back to the client PC to execute whatever else it has queued up.</p>
<p>As pointed out in the comments this will absolutely <em>not work</em> in a loop. You could do some fancy (ugly) hacking to make it work in a loop, but in general that will just make for disastrous spaghetti code.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>
<p>About passing <code>false</code> for the <code>asynchronous</code> parameter, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/open#parameters" rel="nofollow noreferrer">mdn</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Synchronous requests on the main thread can be easily disruptive to the user experience and should be avoided; in fact, many browsers have deprecated synchronous XHR support on the main thread entirely. Synchronous requests are permitted in Workers.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The actual delay</h2>
<p>The number of milliseconds that is passed as argument will be the time that the server waits between receiving the request and sending the response. The delay incurred by transmission and server load will be <em>added</em> to that.</p>

<p>An inliner:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>500 here is the time in milliseconds for which VM will wait before moving to the next line of code.</p>
<p><strong>Bit of tldr;</strong></p>
<p>Basically, when you create a promise, it returns an observable while at creation giving a reference of resolve in a callback meant for handing over data/response once it's available. Here, resolve is called via <code>setTimeOut</code> after 500ms, and till resolve is not executed the outside scope is waiting to proceed further, hence, creating a fake blocking. It's totally different than the non-blocking(or call non-thread-reserving sleep available in other languages), as the thread and most probably the UI and any other ongoing tasks of webpage/node-application will be blocked and the main thread will be exclusively used for awaiting the promise resolution.</p>

<p>For browsers, I agree that setTimeout and setInterval are the way to go.</p>
<p>But for server-side code, it may require a blocking function (for example, so you can effectively have thread synchronization).</p>

<p>Most of the answers here are misguided or at the very least outdated. There is no reason JavaScript has to be single threaded, and indeed it isn't. Today all the mainstream browsers support workers. Before this was the case, other JavaScript runtimes like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhino_%28JavaScript_engine%29" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Rhino</a> and Node.js supported multithreading.</p>
<p>'JavaScript is single threaded' is not a valid answer. For example, running a sleep function within a worker would not block any of the code running in the UI thread.</p>
<p>In newer runtimes supporting generators and yield, one could bring similar functionality to the sleep function in a singlethreaded environment:</p>

<p>This imitation of sleep is different from a true sleep function as it does not block the thread. It is simply sugar on top of JavaScript's current <em>setTimeout</em> function. This functionality type has been implemented in <a href="http://taskjs.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Task.js</a> and should work today in Firefox.</p>

<p>I have searched/googled quite a few webpages on JavaScript sleep/wait... and there is <em>no</em> answer if you want JavaScript to "RUN, DELAY, RUN"... what most people got was either, "RUN, RUN(useless stuff), RUN" or "RUN, RUN + delayed RUN"...</p>

here is a solution that works... but you have to chop up your running codes...:

<p>I can understand the purpose of a sleep function if you have to deal with synchronous execution. The setInterval and setTimeout functions create a parallel execution thread which returns the execution sequence back to the main program, which is ineffective if you have to wait for a given result. Of course one may use events and handlers, but in some cases is not what is intended.</p>

<p>If you want less clunky functions than <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>setInterval</code>, you can wrap them in functions that just reverse the order of the arguments and give them nice names:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">after</span>(<span class="hljs-params">ms, fn</span>){ <span class="hljs-built_in">setTimeout</span>(fn, ms); }
<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">every</span>(<span class="hljs-params">ms, fn</span>){ <span class="hljs-built_in">setInterval</span>(fn, ms); }
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoffeeScript" rel="nofollow noreferrer">CoffeeScript</a> versions:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">after = (ms, fn)-&gt; <span class="hljs-built_in">setTimeout</span> fn, ms
every = (ms, fn)-&gt; <span class="hljs-built_in">setInterval</span> fn, ms
</code></pre>
<p>You can then use them nicely with anonymous functions:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">after</span>(<span class="hljs-number">1000</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"it's been a second"</span>);
    <span class="hljs-title function_">after</span>(<span class="hljs-number">1000</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
        <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"it's been another second"</span>);
    });
});

<p>It can be done using Java's sleep method. I've tested it in Firefox and Internet&nbsp;Explorer and it doesn't lock the computer, chew up resources, or cause endless server hits. It seems like a clean solution to me.</p>
<p>First you have to get Java loaded up on the page and make its methods available. To do that, I did this:</p>

    <span class="hljs-variable language_">window</span>.<span class="hljs-property">java</span> = appletRef.<span class="hljs-property">Packages</span>.<span class="hljs-property">java</span>;
  } <span class="hljs-comment">// endfunction</span>

</code></pre>
<p>Then, all you have to do when you want a painless pause in your JavaScript code is:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">java.<span class="hljs-property">lang</span>.<span class="hljs-property">Thread</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">sleep</span>(xxx)
</code></pre>
<p>Where xxx is time in milliseconds. In my case (by way of justification), this was part of back-end order fulfilment at a very small company and I needed to print an invoice that had to be loaded from the server. I did it by loading the invoice (as a webpage) into an iFrame and then printing the iFrame.</p>
<p>Of course, I had to wait until the page was fully loaded before I could print, so the JavaScript code had to pause. I accomplished this by having the invoice page (in the iFrame) change a hidden form field on the parent page with the onLoad event.  And the code on the parent page to print the invoice looked like this (irrelevant parts cut for clarity):</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> isReady = <span class="hljs-built_in">eval</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'document.batchForm.ready'</span>);

If you are used to writing in multi-threaded languages, you probably have the idea of yielding execution for a set amount of time until your thread wakes up.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The issue here is that JavaScript is a single-thread event-based model. While in a specific case, it might be nice to have the whole engine wait for a few seconds, in general it is bad practice. Suppose I wanted to make use of your functions while writing my own? When I called your method, my methods would all freeze up. If JavaScript could somehow preserve your function\u0026apos;s execution context, store it somewhere, then bring it back and continue later, then sleep could happen, but that would basically be threading.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So you are pretty much stuck with what others have suggested -- you\u0026apos;ll need to break your code up into multiple functions.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Your question is a bit of a false choice, then. There is no way to sleep in the way you want, nor should you pursue the solution you suggest.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In JavaScript, I rewrite every function so that it can end as soon as possible. You want the browser back in control so it can make your DOM changes.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Every time I\u0026apos;ve wanted a sleep in the middle of my function, I refactored to use a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;setTimeout()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Edit\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The infamous sleep, or delay, function within any language is much debated.  Some will say that there should always be a signal or callback to fire a given functionality, others will argue that sometimes an arbitrary moment of delay is useful.  I say that to each their own and one rule can never dictate anything in this industry.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Writing a sleep function is simple and made even more usable with JavaScript Promises:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-js s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-comment\u0026quot;\u0026gt;// sleep time expects milliseconds\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;function\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;
