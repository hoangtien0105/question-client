Today, I played with the toString() method on the date object and surprisingly it serves the purpose of formatting date to strings.

Also here I couldn&#x27;t find any documentation on all the ways we can format the date object into a string.

Where is the documentation which lists the format specifiers supported by the Date() object?

There are a couple of good examples in this same page.\n\nIf to write a formatting function is too long, there are plenty of libraries around which does it. Some other answers already enumerate them. But increasing dependencies also has it counter-part.\n\nStandard ECMAScript formatting functions:\n\nSince more recent versions of ECMAscript, the Date class has some specific formatting functions:\n\n\n  toDateString: Implementation dependent, show only the date.\n  \n  http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-date.prototype.todatestring\n\nnew Date().toDateString(); // e.g. &quot;Fri Nov 11 2016&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  toISOString: Show ISO 8601 date and time.\n  \n  http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-date.prototype.toisostring\n\nnew Date().toISOString(); // e.g. &quot;2016-11-21T08:00:00.000Z&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  toJSON: Stringifier for JSON. \n  \n  http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-date.prototype.tojson\n\nnew Date().toJSON(); // e.g. &quot;2016-11-21T08:00:00.000Z&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  toLocaleDateString: Implementation dependent, a date in locale format.\n  \n  http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-date.prototype.tolocaledatestring\n\nnew Date().toLocaleDateString(); // e.g. &quot;21/11/2016&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  toLocaleString: Implementation dependent, a date&amp;time in locale format.\n  \n  http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-date.prototype.tolocalestring\n\nnew Date().toLocaleString(); // e.g. &quot;21/11/2016, 08:00:00 AM&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  toLocaleTimeString: Implementation dependent, a time in locale format.\n  \n  http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-date.prototype.tolocaletimestring\n\nnew Date().toLocaleTimeString(); // e.g. &quot;08:00:00 AM&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  toString: Generic toString for Date.\n  \n  http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-date.prototype.tostring\n\nnew Date().toString(); // e.g. &quot;Fri Nov 11 2016 08:00:00 GMT+0100 (W.

True, there are many libraries out there to help with date manipulation.  Some are better than others.  But that wasn&apos;t the question asked.\n\nAFAIK, pure JavaScript doesn&apos;t support format specifiers the way you have indicated you&apos;d like to use them.  But it does support methods for formatting dates and/or times, such as .toLocaleDateString(), .toLocaleTimeString(), and .toUTCString().\n\nThe Date object reference I use most frequently is on the w3schools.com website (but a quick Google search will reveal many more that may better meet your needs).\n\nAlso note that the Date Object Properties section provides a link to prototype, which illustrates some ways you can extend the Date object with custom methods.  There has been some debate in the JavaScript community over the years about whether or not this is best practice, and I am not advocating for or against it, just pointing out its existence.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"The Short Answer\nThere is no universal documentation that javascript caters to; every browser that has javascript is really an implementation. However, there is a standard that most modern browsers tend to follow, and thats the EMCAScript standard; the ECMAScript standard strings would take, minimally, a modified implementation of the ISO 8601 definition.\nIn addition to this, there is a second standard set forward by the IETF that browsers tend to follow as well, which is the definition for timestamps made in the RFC 2822. Actual documentation can be found in the references list at the bottom.\nFrom this you can expect basic functionality, but what ought to be is not inherently what is. Im going to go a little in depth with this procedurally though, as it appears only three people actually answered the question (Scott, goofballLogic, and peller namely) which, to me, suggests most people are unaware of what actually happens when you create a Date object.\n\nThe Long Answer\n\nWhere is the documentation which lists the format specifiers supported by the Date() object?\n\n\nTo answer the question, or typically even look for the answer to this question, you need to know that javascript is not a novel language; its actually an implementation of ECMAScript, and follows the ECMAScript standards (but note, javascript also actually pre-dated those standards; EMCAScript standards are built off the early implementation of LiveScript/JavaScript). The current ECMAScript standard is 5.1 (2011); at the time that the question was originally asked (June 09), the standard was 3 (4 was abandoned), but 5 was released shortly after the post at the end of 2009. This should outline one problem; what standard a javascript implementation may follow, may not reflect what is actually in place, because a) its an implementation of a given standard, b) not all implementations of a standard are puritan, and c) functionality is not released in synchronization with a new standard as d) an implementation is a constant work in progress\nEssentially, when dealing with javascript, youre dealing with a derivative (javascript specific to the browser) of an implementation (javascript itself). Googles V8, for example, implements ECMAScript 5.0, but Internet Explorers JScript doesnt attempt to conform to any ECMAScript standard, yet Internet Explorer 9 does conform to ECMAScript 5.0.\nWhen a single argument is passed to new Date(), it casts this function prototype:\nnew Date(value)\n\nWhen two or more arguments are passed to new Date(), it casts this function prototype:\nnew Date (year, month [, date [, hours [, minutes [, seconds [, ms ] ] ] ] ] )\n\n\nBoth of those functions should look familiar, but this does not immediately answer your question and what quantifies as an acceptable date format requires further explanation. When you pass a string to new Date(), it will call the prototype (note that I&apos;m using the word prototype loosely; the versions may be individual functions, or it may be part of a conditional statement in a single function) for new Date(value) with your string as the argument for the value parameter. This function will first check whether it is a number or a string. The documentation for this function can be found here:\n\nhttp://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.3.2\n\nFrom this, we can deduce that to get the string formatting allowed for new Date(value), we have to look at the method Date.parse(string). The documentation for this method can be found here:\n\nhttp://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.4.2\n\nAnd we can further infer that dates are expected to be in a modified ISO 8601 Extended Format, as specified here:\n\nhttp://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.1.15\n\nHowever, we can recognize from experience that javascripts Date object accepts other formats (enforced by the existence of this question in the first place), and this is okay because ECMAScript allows for implementation specific formats. However, that still doesnt answer the question of what documentation is available on the available formats, nor what formats are actually allowed. Were going to look at Googles javascript implementation, V8; please note Im not suggesting this is the best javascript engine (how can one define best or even good) and one cannot assume that the formats allowed in V8 represent all formats available today, but I think its fair to assume they do follow modern expectations.\n\nGoogles V8, date.js, DateConstructor\n\n\nhttps://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/date.js?r=18400#141\n\nLooking at the DateConstructor function, we can deduce we need to find the DateParse function; however, note that year is not the actual year and is only a reference to the year parameter.\n\nGoogles V8, date.js, DateParse\n\n\nhttps://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/date.js?r=18400#270\n\nThis calls %DateParseString, which is actually a run-time function reference for a C++ function. It refers to the following code:\n\nGoogles V8, runtime.cc, %DateParseString\n\n\nhttps://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/runtime.cc?r=18400#9559\n\nThe function call were concerned with in this function is for DateParser::Parse(); ignore the logic surrounding those function calls, these are just checks to conform to the encoding type (ASCII and UC16). DateParser::Parse is defined here:\n\nGoogle&apos;s V8, dateparser-inl.h, DateParser::Parse\n\n\nhttps://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/dateparser-inl.h?r=18400#36\n\nThis is the function that actually defines what formats it accepts. Essentially, it checks for the EMCAScript 5.0 ISO 8601 standard and if it is not standards compliant, then it will attempt to build the date based on legacy formats. A few key points based on the comments:\n\nWords before the first number that are unknown to the parser are ignored.\nParenthesized text are ignored.\nUnsigned numbers followed by : are interpreted as a time component.\nUnsigned numbers followed by . are interpreted as a time component, and must be followed by milliseconds.\nSigned numbers followed by the hour or hour minute (e.g. +5:15 or +0515) are interpreted as the timezone.\nWhen declaring the hour and minute, you can use either hh:mm or hhmm.\nWords that indicate a time zone are interpreted as a time zone.\nAll other numbers are interpreted as date components.\nAll words that start with the first three digits of a month are interpreted as the month.\nYou can define minutes and hours together in either of the two formats: hh:mm or hhmm.\nSymbols like +, - and unmatched ) are not allowed after a number has been processed.\nItems that match multiple formats (e.g. 1970-01-01) are processed as a standard compliant EMCAScript 5.0 ISO 8601 string.\n\nSo this should be enough to give you a basic idea of what to expect when it comes to passing a string into a Date object. You can further expand upon this by looking at the following specification that Mozilla points to on the Mozilla Developer Network (compliant to the IETF RFC 2822 timestamps):\n\nhttps://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2822#page-14\n\nThe Microsoft Developer Network additionally mentions an additional standard for the Date object: ECMA-402, the ECMAScript Internationalization API Specification, which is complementary to the ECMAScript 5.1 standard (and future ones). That can be found here:\n\nhttp://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/\n\nIn any case, this should aid in highlighting that there is no &quot;documentation&quot; that universally represents all implementations of javascript, but there is still enough documentation available to make reasonable sense of what strings are acceptable for a Date object. Quite the loaded question when you think about it, yes? :P\n\nReferences\nhttp://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.3.2\nhttp://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.4.2\nhttp://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.1.15\nhttps://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2822#page-14\nhttp://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/\nhttps://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/date.js?r=18400#141\nhttps://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/date.js?r=18400#270\nhttps://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/runtime.cc?r=18400#9559\nhttps://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/dateparser-inl.h?r=18400#36\nResources\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff743760(v=vs.94).aspx\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution6","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Make sure you checkout Datejs when dealing with dates in JavaScript.

<p>I noticed that JavaScript's <code>new Date()</code> function is very smart in accepting dates in several formats.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title class_">Xmas95</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Date</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"25 Dec, 1995 23:15:00"</span>)
<span class="hljs-title class_">Xmas95</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Date</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"2009 06 12,12:52:39"</span>)
<span class="hljs-title class_">Xmas95</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Date</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"20 09 2006,12:52:39"</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>I could not find documentation anywhere showing all the valid string formats while calling <code>new Date()</code> function.</p>

<p>This is for converting a string to a date. If we look at the opposite side, that is, converting a date object to a string, until now I was under the impression that JavaScript doesn't have a built-in API to format a date object into a string.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Editor's note:</strong> The following approach is the asker's attempt that worked on a particular browser but does <em>not</em> work in general; <strong>see the answers on this page</strong> to see some actual solutions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, I played with the <code>toString()</code> method on the date object and surprisingly it serves the purpose of formatting date to strings.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> d1 = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Date</span>();
d1.<span class="hljs-title function_">toString</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'yyyy-MM-dd'</span>);       <span class="hljs-comment">//Returns "2009-06-29" in Internet Explorer, but not Firefox or Chrome</span>
d1.<span class="hljs-title function_">toString</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'dddd, MMMM ,yyyy'</span>)  <span class="hljs-comment">//Returns "Monday, June 29,2009" in Internet Explorer, but not Firefox or Chrome</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Also here I couldn't find any documentation on all the ways we can format the date object into a string.</p>

<p>Where is the documentation which lists the format specifiers supported by the <code>Date()</code> object?</p>

<h2>Custom formatting function:</h2>

<p>For fixed formats, a simple function make the job. Following example generate the international format YYYY-MM-DD:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">dateToYMD</span>(<span class="hljs-params">date</span>) {

    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> y = date.<span class="hljs-title function_">getFullYear</span>();
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-string">''</span> + y + <span class="hljs-string">'-'</span> + (m&lt;=<span class="hljs-number">9</span> ? <span class="hljs-string">'0'</span> + m : m) + <span class="hljs-string">'-'</span> + (d &lt;= <span class="hljs-number">9</span> ? <span class="hljs-string">'0'</span> + d : d);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: It is, however, usually not a good idea to extend the Javascript standard libraries (e.g. by adding this function to the prototype of Date). </p>

<p>A more advanced function could generate configurable output based on a format parameter. There are a couple of good examples in this same page.</p>

<p>If to write a formatting function is too long, there are plenty of libraries around which does it. Some other answers already enumerate them. But increasing dependencies also has it counter-part.</p>

  <p>Where is the documentation which lists the format specifiers supported by the <code>Date()</code> object?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I stumbled across this today and was quite surprised that no one took the time to answer this simple question.  True, there are many libraries out there to help with date manipulation.  Some are better than others.  But that wasn't the question asked.</p>

<p>AFAIK, pure JavaScript doesn't support format specifiers <strong>the way you have indicated you'd like to use them</strong>.  But it does support methods for formatting dates and/or times, such as <code>.toLocaleDateString()</code>, <code>.toLocaleTimeString()</code>, and <code>.toUTCString()</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>Date</code> object reference I use most frequently is on the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp">w3schools.com website</a> (but <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=javascript%20date%20object%20reference">a quick Google search</a> will reveal many more that may better meet your needs).</p>

<p>Also note that the <strong>Date Object Properties</strong> section provides a link to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_prototype_date.asp"><code>prototype</code></a>, which illustrates some ways you can extend the Date object with custom methods.  There has been <a href="http://perfectionkills.com/extending-built-in-native-objects-evil-or-not/">some debate</a> in the JavaScript community over the years about whether or not this is best practice, and I am not advocating for or against it, just pointing out its existence.</p>

<h1>The Short Answer</h1>
<p>There is no universal documentation that javascript caters to; every browser that has javascript is really an implementation. However, there is a standard that most modern browsers tend to follow, and thats the EMCAScript standard; the ECMAScript standard strings would take, minimally, a modified implementation of the ISO 8601 definition.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there is a second standard set forward by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force" rel="nofollow noreferrer">IETF</a> that browsers tend to follow as well, which is the definition for timestamps made in the RFC 2822. Actual documentation can be found in the references list at the bottom.</p>
<p>From this you can expect basic functionality, but what ought to be is not inherently what is. Im going to go a little in depth with this procedurally though, as it appears only three people actually answered the question (Scott, goofballLogic, and peller namely) which, to me, suggests most people are unaware of what actually happens when you create a Date object.</p>

<h1>The Long Answer</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Where is the documentation which lists the format specifiers supported by the Date() object?</p>
</blockquote>
<br>
<p>To answer the question, or typically even look for the answer to this question, you need to know that javascript is not a novel language; its actually an implementation of ECMAScript, and follows the ECMAScript standards (but note, javascript also actually pre-dated those standards; EMCAScript standards are built off the early implementation of LiveScript/JavaScript). The current ECMAScript standard is 5.1 (2011); at the time that the question was originally asked (June 09), the standard was 3 (4 was abandoned), but 5 was released shortly after the post at the end of 2009. This should outline one problem; what standard a javascript implementation may follow, may not reflect what is actually in place, because a) its an implementation of a given standard, b) not all implementations of a standard are puritan, and c) functionality is not released in synchronization with a new standard as d) an implementation is a constant work in progress</p>
<p>Essentially, when dealing with javascript, youre dealing with a derivative (javascript specific to the browser) of an implementation (javascript itself). Googles V8, for example, implements ECMAScript 5.0, but Internet Explorers JScript doesnt attempt to conform to any ECMAScript standard, yet Internet&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;9 does conform to ECMAScript 5.0.</p>
<p>When a single argument is passed to new Date(), it casts this function prototype:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Date</span>(value)
</code></pre>
<p>When two or more arguments are passed to new Date(), it casts this function prototype:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Date</span> (year, month [, date [, hours [, minutes [, seconds [, ms ] ] ] ] ] )
</code></pre>
<br>
Both of those functions should look familiar, but this does not immediately answer your question and what quantifies as an acceptable date format requires further explanation. When you pass a string to new Date(), it will call the prototype (note that I'm using the word <em>prototype</em> loosely; the versions may be individual functions, or it may be part of a conditional statement in a single function) for <strong>new Date(value)</strong> with your string as the argument for the value parameter. This function will first check whether it is a number or a string. The documentation for this function can be found here:
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.3.2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.3.2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this, we can deduce that to get the string formatting allowed for new Date(value), we have to look at the method Date.parse(string). The documentation for this method can be found here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.4.2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.4.2</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we can further infer that dates are expected to be in a modified ISO 8601 Extended Format, as specified here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.1.15" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.1.15</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, we can recognize from experience that javascripts Date object accepts other formats (enforced by the existence of this question in the first place), and this is okay because ECMAScript allows for implementation specific formats. However, that still doesnt answer the question of what documentation is available on the available formats, nor what formats are actually allowed. Were going to look at Googles javascript implementation, V8; please note Im not suggesting this is the best javascript engine (how can one define best or even good) and one cannot assume that the formats allowed in V8 represent all formats available today, but I think its fair to assume they do follow modern expectations.</p>

<p>Looking at the DateConstructor function, we can deduce we need to find the DateParse function; however, note that year is not the actual year and is only a reference to the year parameter.</p>

<p>This calls %DateParseString, which is actually a run-time function reference for a C++ function. It refers to the following code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Googles V8, runtime.cc, %DateParseString</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The function call were concerned with in this function is for DateParser::Parse(); ignore the logic surrounding those function calls, these are just checks to conform to the encoding type (ASCII and UC16). DateParser::Parse is defined here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Google's V8, dateparser-inl.h, DateParser::Parse</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/dateparser-inl.h?r=18400#36" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/dateparser-inl.h?r=18400#36</a></p>

<p>This is the function that actually defines what formats it accepts. Essentially, it checks for the EMCAScript 5.0 ISO 8601 standard and if it is not standards compliant, then it will attempt to build the date based on legacy formats. A few key points based on the comments:</p>
<ol>
<li>Words before the first number that are unknown to the parser are ignored.</li>
<li>Parenthesized text are ignored.</li>
<li>Unsigned numbers followed by : are interpreted as a time component.</li>
<li>Unsigned numbers followed by . are interpreted as a time component, and must be followed by milliseconds.</li>
<li>Signed numbers followed by the hour or hour minute (e.g. +5:15 or +0515) are interpreted as the timezone.</li>
<li>When declaring the hour and minute, you can use either hh:mm or hhmm.</li>
<li>Words that indicate a time zone are interpreted as a time zone.</li>
<li>All other numbers are interpreted as date components.</li>
<li>All words that start with the first three digits of a month are interpreted as the month.</li>
<li>You can define minutes and hours together in either of the two formats: hh:mm or hhmm.</li>
<li>Symbols like +, - and unmatched ) are not allowed after a number has been processed.</li>
<li>Items that match multiple formats (e.g. 1970-01-01) are processed as a standard compliant EMCAScript 5.0 ISO 8601 string.</li>
</ol>
<p>So this should be enough to give you a basic idea of what to expect when it comes to passing a string into a Date object. You can further expand upon this by looking at the following specification that Mozilla points to on the Mozilla Developer Network (compliant to the IETF RFC 2822 timestamps):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2822#page-14" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2822#page-14</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Microsoft Developer Network additionally mentions an additional standard for the Date object: ECMA-402, the ECMAScript Internationalization API Specification, which is complementary to the ECMAScript 5.1 standard (and future ones). That can be found here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In any case, this should aid in highlighting that there is no "documentation" that universally represents all implementations of javascript, but there is still enough documentation available to make reasonable sense of what strings are acceptable for a Date object. Quite the loaded question when you think about it, yes? :P</p>

<h2>All browsers</h2>

<p>The most reliable way to format a date with the source format you're using, is to apply the following steps :</p>

<ol>
<li>Use <code>new Date()</code> to create a <code>Date</code> object</li>
<li>Use <code>.getDate()</code>, <code>.getMonth()</code> and <code>.getFullYear()</code> to get respectively the day, month and year</li>
<li>Paste the pieces together according to your target format</li>
</ol>

<p>I was unable to find any definitive documentation on valid date formats so I wrote my own test to see what is supported in various browsers.</p>

<p><a href="http://blarg.co.uk/blog/javascript-date-formats" rel="noreferrer">http://blarg.co.uk/blog/javascript-date-formats</a></p>

<p>My results concluded the following formats are valid in all browsers that I tested (examples use the date "9th August 2013"):</p>

<p><strong>[Full Year]/[Month]/[Date number]</strong> - Month can be either the number with or without a leading zero or the month name in short or long format, and date number can be with or without a leading zero.</p>

<ul>
<li>2013/08/09</li>
<li>2013/08/9</li>
<li>2013/8/09</li>
<li>2013/8/9</li>
<li>2013/August/09</li>
<li>2013/August/9</li>
<li>2013/Aug/09</li>
<li>2013/Aug/9</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>[Month]/[Full Year]/[Date Number]</strong> - Month can be either the number with or without a leading zero or the month name in short or long format, and date number can be with or without a leading zero. </p>

<ul>
<li>08/2013/09</li>
<li>08/2013/9</li>
<li>8/2013/09</li>
<li>8/2013/9</li>
<li>August/2013/09</li>
<li>August/2013/9</li>
<li>Aug/2013/09</li>
<li>Aug/2013/9</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Any combination of [Full Year], [Month Name] and [Date Number] separated by spaces</strong> - Month name can be in either short or long format, and date number can be with or without a leading zero. </p>

<ul>
<li>2013 August 09</li>
<li>August 2013 09</li>
<li>09 August 2013</li>
<li>2013 Aug 09</li>
<li>Aug 9 2013</li>
<li>2013 9 Aug</li>
<li>etc...</li>
</ul>

<p>Also valid in "modern browsers" (or in other words all browsers except IE9 and below)</p>

<p><strong>[Full Year]-[Month Number]-[Date Number]</strong> - Month and Date Number must include leading zeros (this is the format that the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/datetime.html" rel="noreferrer">MySQL Date type</a> uses) </p>

<ul>
<li>2013-08-09</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Using month names:</strong><br>
Interestingly, when using month names I discovered that only the first 3 characters of the month name are ever used so all the of the following are perfectly valid:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Date</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'9 August 2013'</span>);

<p>Formatting and especially parsing dates in JavaScript can be a bit of a headache. Not all browsers handle dates in the same way. So while it's useful to know the base methods, its more practical to use a helper library.</p>

<p>The library <a href="http://sugarjs.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">sugar.js</a> has some great functionality for working with dates in JavaScript. And it is very well <a href="http://sugarjs.com/dates" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documented</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sugar gives the Date class much love starting with the Date.create
  method which can understand dates in just about any format in 15 major
  languages, including relative formats like "1 hour ago". Dates can
  also be output in any format or language using an easy to understand
  syntax, with shortcuts to commonly used date formats. Complex date
  comparison is also possible with methods like is, which understand any
  format and apply built in precision.</p>

<p>Not sure if it'll help, but I've found it useful in several projects - looks like it'll do what you need.</p>

<p>Supports date/time formatting, date math (add/subtract date parts), date compare, date parsing, etc. It's liberally open sourced.</p>

<p>No reason to consider it if you're already using a framework (they're all capable), but if you just need to quickly add date manipulation to a project give it a chance.</p>

<p>The answer is "nowhere" since the date formatting is proprietary functionality. I don't think the toString functions are intended to conform to a specific format. e.g. in the ECMAScript 5.1 spec (<a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf</a>, 2/8/2013, page 173), the <em>toString</em> function is documented as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The contents of the String are implementation-dependent"</p>

<p>If you don't need all the features that a library like <a href="http://momentjs.com/" rel="nofollow">Moment.js</a> provides, then you can use my port of <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strftime.3.html" rel="nofollow">strftime</a>. It's lightweight (1.35 KB vs. 57.9 KB minified compared to Moment.js 2.15.0) and provides most of the functionality of <code>strftime()</code>.</p>

However, there is a standard that most modern browsers tend to follow, and thats the EMCAScript standard; the ECMAScript standard strings would take, minimally, a modified implementation of the ISO 8601 definition.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In addition to this, there is a second standard set forward by the \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;nofollow noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;IETF\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; that browsers tend to follow as well, which is the definition for timestamps made in the RFC 2822. Actual documentation can be found in the references list at the bottom.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;From this you can expect basic functionality, but what ought to be is not inherently what is. Im going to go a little in depth with this procedurally though, as it appears only three people actually answered the question (Scott, goofballLogic, and peller namely) which, to me, suggests most people are unaware of what actually happens when you create a Date object.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;The Long Answer\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Where is the documentation which lists the format specifiers supported by the Date() object?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;To answer the question, or typically even look for the answer to this question, you need to know that javascript is not a novel language; its actually an implementation of ECMAScript, and follows the ECMAScript standards (but note, javascript also actually pre-dated those standards; EMCAScript standards are built off the early implementation of LiveScript/JavaScript). The current ECMAScript standard is 5.1 (2011); at the time that the question was originally asked (June 09), the standard was 3 (4 was abandoned), but 5 was released shortly after the post at the end of 2009. This should outline one problem; what standard a javascript implementation may follow, may not reflect what is actually in place, because a) its an implementation of a given standard, b) not all implementations of a standard are puritan, and c) functionality is not released in synchronization with a new standard as d) an implementation is a constant work in progress\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Essentially, when dealing with javascript, youre dealing with a derivative (javascript specific to the browser) of an implementation (javascript itself). Googles V8, for example, implements ECMAScript 5.0, but Internet Explorers JScript doesnt attempt to conform to any ECMAScript standard, yet Internet\u0026amp;nbsp;Explorer\u0026amp;nbsp;9 does conform to ECMAScript 5.0.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When a single argument is passed to new Date(), it casts this function prototype:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-js s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;new\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title class_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Date\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;(value)\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When two or more arguments are passed to new Date(), it casts this function prototype:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-js s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;new\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title class_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Date\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; (year, month [, date [, hours [, minutes [, seconds [, ms ] ] ] ] ] )\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nBoth of those functions should look familiar, but this does not immediately answer your question and what quantifies as an acceptable date format requires further explanation. When you pass a string to new Date(), it will call the prototype (note that I\u0026apos;m using the word \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;prototype\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; loosely; the versions may be individual functions, or it may be part of a conditional statement in a single function) for \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;new Date(value)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; with your string as the argument for the value parameter. This function will first check whether it is a number or a string. The documentation for this function can be found here:\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.3.2\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;nofollow noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.3.2\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;From this, we can deduce that to get the string formatting allowed for new Date(value), we have to look at the method Date.parse(string).

However, that still doesnt answer the question of what documentation is available on the available formats, nor what formats are actually allowed. Were going to look at Googles javascript implementation, V8; please note Im not suggesting this is the best javascript engine (how can one define best or even good) and one cannot assume that the formats allowed in V8 represent all formats available today, but I think its fair to assume they do follow modern expectations.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Googles V8, date.js, DateConstructor\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/date.js?r=18400#141\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;nofollow noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/date.js?r=18400#141\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Looking at the DateConstructor function, we can deduce we need to find the DateParse function; however, note that year is not the actual year and is only a reference to the year parameter.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Googles V8, date.js, DateParse\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/date.js?r=18400#270\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;nofollow noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;https://code.google.com/p/v8/source/browse/trunk/src/date.js?r=18400#270\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This calls %DateParseString, which is actually a run-time function reference for a C++ function.
