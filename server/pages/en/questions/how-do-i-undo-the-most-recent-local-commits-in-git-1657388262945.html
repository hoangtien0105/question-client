It will undo your last commit while leaving your working tree (the state of your files on disk) untouched. You&apos;ll need to add them again before you can commit them again).\nMake corrections to working tree files.\ngit add anything that you want to include in your new commit.\nCommit the changes, reusing the old commit message. reset copied the old head to .git/ORIG_HEAD; commit with -c ORIG_HEAD will open an editor, which initially contains the log message from the old commit and allows you to edit it. If you do not need to edit the message, you could use the -C option.\n\nAlternatively, to edit the previous commit (or just its commit message), commit --amend will add changes within the current index to the previous commit.\nTo remove (not revert) a commit that has been pushed to the server, rewriting history with git push origin main --force[-with-lease] is necessary. It&apos;s almost always a bad idea to use --force; prefer --force-with-lease instead, and as noted in the git manual:\n\nYou should understand the implications of rewriting history if you [rewrite history] has already been published.\n\n\nFurther Reading\nYou can use git reflog to determine the SHA-1 for the commit to which you wish to revert. Once you have this value, use the sequence of commands as explained above.\n\nHEAD~ is the same as HEAD~1. The article What is the HEAD in git? is helpful if you want to uncommit multiple commits.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Undoing a commit is a little scary if you don&apos;t know how it works.  But it&apos;s actually amazingly easy if you do understand. I&apos;ll show you the 4 different ways you can undo a commit.\nSay you have this, where C is your HEAD and (F) is the state of your files.\n   (F)\nA-B-C\n    \n  master\n\nOption 1: git reset --hard\nYou want to destroy commit C and also throw away any uncommitted changes.  You do this:\ngit reset --hard HEAD~1\n\nThe result is:\n (F)\nA-B\n  \nmaster\n\nNow B is the HEAD.  Because you used --hard, your files are reset to their state at commit B.\nOption 2: git reset\nMaybe commit C wasn&apos;t a disaster, but just a bit off.  You want to undo the commit but keep your changes for a bit of editing before you do a better commit.  Starting again from here, with C as your HEAD:\n   (F)\nA-B-C\n    \n  master\n\nDo this, leaving off the --hard:\ngit reset HEAD~1\n\nIn this case the result is:\n   (F)\nA-B-C\n  \nmaster\n\nIn both cases, HEAD is just a pointer to the latest commit.  When you do a git reset HEAD~1, you tell Git to move the HEAD pointer back one commit.  But (unless you use --hard) you leave your files as they were.  So now git status shows the changes you had checked into C.  You haven&apos;t lost a thing!\nOption 3: git reset --soft\nFor the lightest touch, you can even undo your commit but leave your files and your index:\ngit reset --soft HEAD~1\n\nThis not only leaves your files alone, it even leaves your index alone.  When you do git status, you&apos;ll see that the same files are in the index as before.  In fact, right after this command, you could do git commit and you&apos;d be redoing the same commit you just had.\nOption 4: you did git reset --hard and need to get that code back\nOne more thing: Suppose you destroy a commit as in the first example, but then discover you needed it after all?  Tough luck, right?\nNope, there&apos;s still a way to get it back.  Type this\ngit reflog\n\nand you&apos;ll see a list of (partial) commit shas (that is, hashes) that you&apos;ve moved around in.  Find the commit you destroyed, and do this:\ngit checkout -b someNewBranchName shaYouDestroyed\n\nYou&apos;ve now resurrected that commit.  Commits don&apos;t actually get destroyed in Git for some 90 days, so you can usually go back and rescue one you didn&apos;t mean to get rid of.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"There are two ways to &quot;undo&quot; your last commit, depending on whether or not you have already made your commit public (pushed to your remote repository):\nHow to undo a local commit\nLet&apos;s say I committed locally, but now I want to remove that commit.\ngit log\n    commit 101: bad commit    # Latest commit.

<p>Undoing a commit is a little scary if you don't know how it works.  But it's actually amazingly easy if you do understand. I'll show you the 4 different ways you can undo a commit.</p>
<p>Say you have this, where C is your HEAD and (F) is the state of your files.</p>
<pre><code>   (F)
A-B-C
    
  master
</code></pre>
<h3>Option 1: <code>git reset --hard</code></h3>
<p>You want to <strong>destroy commit C and also throw away any uncommitted changes</strong>.  You do this:</p>
<pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD~1
</code></pre>
<p>The result is:</p>
<pre><code> (F)
A-B
  
master
</code></pre>
<p>Now B is the HEAD.  Because you used <code>--hard</code>, your files are reset to their state at commit B.</p>
<h3>Option 2: <code>git reset</code></h3>
<p>Maybe commit C wasn't a disaster, but just a bit off.  You want to <strong>undo the commit but keep your changes</strong> for a bit of editing before you do a better commit.  Starting again from here, with C as your HEAD:</p>
<pre><code>   (F)
A-B-C
    
  master
</code></pre>
<p>Do this, leaving off the <code>--hard</code>:</p>
<pre><code>git reset HEAD~1
</code></pre>
<p>In this case the result is:</p>
<pre><code>   (F)
A-B-C
  
master
</code></pre>
<p>In both cases, HEAD is just a pointer to the latest commit.  When you do a <code>git reset HEAD~1</code>, you tell Git to move the HEAD pointer back one commit.  But (unless you use <code>--hard</code>) you leave your files as they were.  So now <code>git status</code> shows the changes you had checked into C.  You haven't lost a thing!</p>
<h3>Option 3: <code>git reset --soft</code></h3>
<p>For the lightest touch, you can even <strong>undo your commit but leave your files and your <a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/WhatIsTheIndex" rel="noreferrer">index</a></strong>:</p>
<pre><code>git reset --soft HEAD~1
</code></pre>
<p>This not only leaves your files alone, it even leaves your <em>index</em> alone.  When you do <code>git status</code>, you'll see that the same files are in the index as before.  In fact, right after this command, you could do <code>git commit</code> and you'd be redoing the same commit you just had.</p>
<h3>Option 4: you did <code>git reset --hard</code> and need to get that code back</h3>
<p>One more thing: Suppose you <strong>destroy a commit</strong> as in the first example, <strong>but then discover you needed it after all</strong>?  Tough luck, right?</p>
<p>Nope, there's <em>still</em> a way to get it back.  Type this</p>
<pre><code>git reflog
</code></pre>
<p>and you'll see a list of (partial) commit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1#Data_integrity" rel="noreferrer">shas</a> (that is, hashes) that you've moved around in.  Find the commit you destroyed, and do this:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout -b someNewBranchName shaYouDestroyed
</code></pre>
<p>You've now resurrected that commit.  Commits don't actually get destroyed in Git for some 90 days, so you can usually go back and rescue one you didn't mean to get rid of.</p>

<p>There are two ways to "undo" your last commit, depending on whether or not you have already made your commit public (pushed to your remote repository):</p>
<h2>How to undo a local commit</h2>
<p>Let's say I committed locally, but now I want to remove that commit.</p>
<pre><code>git log
    commit 101: bad commit    # Latest commit. This would be called 'HEAD'.
    commit 100: good commit   # Second to last commit. This is the one we want.
</code></pre>
<p>To restore everything back to the way it was prior to the last commit, we need to <code>reset</code> to the commit before <code>HEAD</code>:</p>
<pre><code>git reset --soft HEAD^     # Use --soft if you want to keep your changes
git reset --hard HEAD^     # Use --hard if you don't care about keeping the changes you made
</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>git log</code> will show that our last commit has been removed.</p>
<h2>How to undo a public commit</h2>
<p>If you have already made your commits public, you will want to create a new commit which will "revert" the changes you made in your previous commit (current HEAD).</p>
<pre><code>git revert HEAD
</code></pre>
<p>Your changes will now be reverted and ready for you to commit:</p>
<pre><code>git commit -m 'restoring the file I removed by accident'
git log
    commit 102: restoring the file I removed by accident
    commit 101: removing a file we don't need
    commit 100: adding a file that we need

<h2 id="to-revert-a-commit-rotb">To revert a commit</h2>
<p>Amending a commit is the ideal solution if you need to change the last commit, but a more general solution is <code>reset</code>.</p>
<p>You can reset Git to any commit with:</p>
<pre><code>git reset @~N
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>N</code> is the number of commits before <code>HEAD</code>, and <code>@~</code> resets to the previous commit.</p>
<p>Instead of amending the commit, you could use:</p>
<pre><code>git reset @~
git add *.java
git commit -m "Add .java files"
</code></pre>
<p>Check out <code>git help reset</code>, specifically the sections on <code>--soft</code> <code>--mixed</code> and <code>--hard</code>, for a better understanding of what this does.</p>
<h2 id="reflog-hdrm">Reflog</h2>
<p>If you mess up, you can always use the reflog to find dropped commits:</p>
<pre><code>$ git reset @~
$ git reflog
c4f708b HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to @~
2c52489 HEAD@{1}: commit: added some .class files
$ git reset 2c52489

<h2>How to fix the previous local commit</h2>

<p>Use git-gui (or similar) to perform a <code>git commit --amend</code>. From the GUI you can add or remove individual files from the commit. You can also modify the commit message. </p>

<h2>How to undo the previous local commit</h2>

<p>Just reset your branch to the previous location (for example, using <code>gitk</code> or <code>git rebase</code>). Then reapply your changes from a saved copy. After garbage collection in your local repository, it will be like the unwanted commit never happened. To do all of that in a single command, use <code>git reset HEAD~1</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Word of warning</strong>: <em>Careless use of <code>git reset</code> is a good way to get your working copy into a confusing state. I recommend that Git novices avoid this if they can.</em></p>

<h2>How to undo a public commit</h2>

<p>Perform a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1624724/86967">reverse cherry pick</a> (<a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert.html" rel="noreferrer">git-revert</a>) to undo the changes.</p>

<p>If you haven't yet pulled other changes onto your branch, you can simply do...</p>

<pre><code>git revert --no-edit HEAD
</code></pre>

<p>Then push your updated branch to the shared repository.</p>

<p><em>The commit history will show both commits, separately</em>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Advanced: Correction of the <em>private</em> branch in public repository</h2>

<h3><em>This can be dangerous -- be sure you have a local copy of the branch to repush.</em></h3>

<p><em>Also note: You don't want to do this if someone else may be working on the branch.</em></p>

<pre><code>git push --delete (branch_name) ## remove public version of branch
</code></pre>

<p>Clean up your branch locally then repush...</p>

<pre><code>git push origin (branch_name)
</code></pre>

<p><em>In the normal case, you probably needn't worry about your private-branch commit history being pristine.  Just push a followup commit (see 'How to undo a public commit' above), and later, do a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/22417539/86967">squash-merge</a> to hide the history.</em></p>

<p><strong>How to undo the last Git commit?</strong></p>

<p>To restore everything back to the way it was prior to the last commit, we need to reset to the commit before HEAD.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you don't want to keep your changes that you made:</p>

<pre><code>git reset --hard HEAD^
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If you want to keep your changes:</p>

<pre><code>git reset --soft HEAD^
</code></pre></li>

<p>Another way:</p>

<p>Checkout the branch you want to revert, then reset your local working copy back to the commit that you want to be the latest one on the remote server (everything after it will go bye-bye). To do this, in SourceTree I right-clicked on the and selected "Reset BRANCHNAME to this commit".</p>

<p>Then navigate to your repository's local directory and run this command:</p>

<pre><code>git -c diff.mnemonicprefix=false -c core.quotepath=false push -v -f --tags REPOSITORY_NAME BRANCHNAME:BRANCHNAME

<p>There are two main scenarios</p>

<p><strong>You haven't pushed the commit yet</strong></p>

<p>If the problem was extra files you commited (and you don't want those on repository), you can remove them using <code>git rm</code> and then commiting with <code>--amend</code></p>

<pre><code>git rm &lt;pathToFile&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can also remove entire directories with <code>-r</code>, or even combine with other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29">Bash</a> commands</p>

<pre><code>git rm -r &lt;pathToDirectory&gt;
git rm $(find -name '*.class')
</code></pre>

<p>After removing the files, you can commit, with <strong>--amend</strong> option</p>

<pre><code>git commit --amend -C HEAD # the -C option is to use the same commit message
</code></pre>

<p>This will rewrite your recent local commit removing the extra files, so, these files will never be sent on push and also will be removed from your local .git repository by GC.</p>

<p><strong>You already pushed the commit</strong></p>

<p>You can apply the same solution of the other scenario and then doing <code>git push</code> with the <code>-f</code> option, but it is <strong>not recommended</strong> since it overwrites the remote history with a divergent change (it can mess your repository).</p>

<p>Instead, you have to do the commit without <code>--amend</code> (remember this about -amend`: That option rewrites the history on the last commit).</p>

<h3>For a local commit</h3>

<pre><code>git reset --soft HEAD~1

<p>or if you do not remember exactly in which commit it is, you might use</p>

<pre><code>git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;

<h3>For a pushed commit</h3>

<p>The proper way of removing files from the repository history is using <code>git filter-branch</code>. That is,</p>

<pre class="lang-bash s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash">git filter-branch --index-filter <span class="hljs-string">'git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;'</span> HEAD

<p>There are many ways to do it:</p>

<p>Git command to undo the last commit/ previous commits:</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Do Not use --hard if you do not know what you are doing.
--hard is too <strong>dangerous</strong>, and it might <strong>delete your files.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Basic command to revert the commit in Git is:</strong></p>

<pre><code>$ git reset --hard &lt;COMMIT -ID&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>$ git reset --hard HEAD~&lt;n&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>COMMIT-ID</strong>: ID for the commit</p>

<p><strong>n:</strong>  is number of last commits you want to revert</p>

<p>You can get the commit id as shown below:</p>

<pre><code>$ **git log --oneline**

d81d3f1 function to subtract two numbers

be20eb8 function to add two numbers

bedgfgg function to mulitply two numbers
</code></pre>

<p>where <strong>d81d3f1</strong> and <strong>be20eb8</strong> are commit id.</p>

<p><strong>Now let's see some cases:</strong></p>

<p><em>Suppose you want to revert the last commit 'd81d3f1'.  Here are two options:</em></p>

<pre><code>$ git reset --hard d81d3f1
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>$ git reset --hard HEAD~1
</code></pre>

<p><em>Suppose you want to revert the commit 'be20eb8':</em></p>

<pre><code>$ git reset --hard be20eb8
</code></pre>

<p>For more detailed information you can refer and try out some other commands too for resetting head to a specified state:</p>

But it\u0026apos;s actually amazingly easy if you do understand. I\u0026apos;ll show you the 4 different ways you can undo a commit.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Say you have this, where C is your HEAD and (F) is the state of your files.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;   (F)\nA-B-C\n    \n  master\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Option 1: \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;git reset --hard\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You want to \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;destroy commit C and also throw away any uncommitted changes\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;.  You do this:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;git reset --hard HEAD~1\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The result is:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt; (F)\nA-B\n  \nmaster\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now B is the HEAD.  Because you used \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;--hard\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, your files are reset to their state at commit B.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Option 2: \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;git reset\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Maybe commit C wasn\u0026apos;t a disaster, but just a bit off.  You want to \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;undo the commit but keep your changes\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; for a bit of editing before you do a better commit.  Starting again from here, with C as your HEAD:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;   (F)\nA-B-C\n    \n  master\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Do this, leaving off the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;--hard\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;git reset HEAD~1\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In this case the result is:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;   (F)\nA-B-C\n  \nmaster\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In both cases, HEAD is just a pointer to the latest commit.  When you do a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;git reset HEAD~1\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, you tell Git to move the HEAD pointer back one commit.  But (unless you use \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;--hard\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;) you leave your files as they were.  So now \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;git status\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; shows the changes you had checked into C.  You haven\u0026apos;t lost a thing!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Option 3: \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;git reset --soft\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;For the lightest touch, you can even \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;undo your commit but leave your files and your \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/WhatIsTheIndex\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;index\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;git reset --soft HEAD~1\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This not only leaves your files alone, it even leaves your \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;index\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; alone.  When you do \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;git status\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, you\u0026apos;ll see that the same files are in the index as before.  In fact, right after this command, you could do \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;git commit\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and you\u0026apos;d be redoing the same commit you just had.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Option 4: you did \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;git reset --hard\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and need to get that code back\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;One more thing: Suppose you \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;destroy a commit\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; as in the first example, \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;but then discover you needed it after all\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;?
