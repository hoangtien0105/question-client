These beans are described in the documentation.\nArguably the most important, beans of type HandlerMapping map\n\nincoming requests to handlers and a list of pre- and post-processors\n(handler interceptors) based on some criteria the details of which\nvary by HandlerMapping implementation. The most popular implementation\nsupports annotated controllers but other implementations exists as\nwell.\n\nThe javadoc of HandlerMapping further describes how implementations must behave.\nThe DispatcherServlet finds all beans of this type and registers them in some order (can be customized). While serving a request, the DispatcherServlet loops through these HandlerMapping objects and tests each of them with getHandler to find one that can handle the incoming request, represented as the standard HttpServletRequest. As of 4.3.x, if it doesn&apos;t find any, it logs the warning that you see\n\nNo mapping found for HTTP request with URI [/some/path] in DispatcherServlet with name SomeName\n\nand either throws a NoHandlerFoundException or immediately commits the response with a 404 Not Found status code.\nWhy didn&apos;t the DispatcherServlet find a HandlerMapping that could handle my request?\nThe most common HandlerMapping implementation is RequestMappingHandlerMapping, which handles registering @Controller beans as handlers (really their @RequestMapping annotated methods). You can either declare a bean of this type yourself (with @Bean or &lt;bean&gt; or other mechanism) or you can use the built-in options. These are:\n\nAnnotate your @Configuration class with @EnableWebMvc.\nDeclare a &lt;mvc:annotation-driven /&gt; member in your XML configuration.\n\nAs the link above describes, both of these will register a RequestMappingHandlerMapping bean (and a bunch of other stuff). However, a HandlerMapping isn&apos;t very useful without a handler. RequestMappingHandlerMapping expects some @Controller beans so you need to declare those too, through @Bean methods in a Java configuration or &lt;bean&gt; declarations in an XML configuration or through component scanning of @Controller annotated classes in either. Make sure these beans are present.\nIf you&apos;re getting the warning message and a 404 and you&apos;ve configured all of the above correctly, then you&apos;re sending your request to the wrong URI, one that isn&apos;t handled by a detected @RequestMapping annotated handler method.\nThe spring-webmvc library offers other built-in HandlerMapping implementations. For example, BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping maps\n\nfrom URLs to beans with names that start with a slash (&quot;/&quot;)\n\nand you can always write your own. Obviously, you&apos;ll have to make sure the request you&apos;re sending matches at least one of the registered HandlerMapping object&apos;s handlers.\nIf you don&apos;t implicitly or explicitly register any HandlerMapping beans (or if detectAllHandlerMappings is true), the DispatcherServlet registers some defaults. These are defined in DispatcherServlet.properties in the same package as the DispatcherServlet class. They are BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping and DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping (which is similar to RequestMappingHandlerMapping but deprecated).\nDebugging\nSpring MVC will log handlers registered through RequestMappingHandlerMapping. For example, a @Controller like\n@Controller\npublic class ExampleController {\n    @RequestMapping(path = &quot;/example&quot;, method = RequestMethod.GET, headers = &quot;X-Custom&quot;)\n    public String example() {\n        return &quot;example-view-name&quot;;\n    }\n}\n\nwill log the following at INFO level\nMapped &quot;{[/example],methods=[GET],headers=[X-Custom]}&quot; onto public java.lang.String com.spring.servlet.ExampleController.example()\n\nThis describes the mapping registered. When you see the warning that no handler was found, compare the URI in the message to the mapping listed here. All the restrictions specified in the @RequestMapping must match for Spring MVC to select the handler.\nOther HandlerMapping implementations log their own statements that should hint to their mappings and their corresponding handlers.\nSimilarly, enable Spring logging at DEBUG level to see which beans Spring registers. It should report which annotated classes it finds, which packages it scans, and which beans it initializes. If the ones you expected aren&apos;t present, then review your ApplicationContext configuration.\nOther common mistakes\nA DispatcherServlet is just a typical Java EE Servlet. You register it with your typical &lt;web.xml&gt; &lt;servlet-class&gt; and &lt;servlet-mapping&gt; declaration, or directly through ServletContext#addServlet in a WebApplicationInitializer, or with whatever mechanism Spring boot uses. As such, you must rely on the url mapping logic specified in the Servlet specification, see Chapter 12. See also\n\nHow are Servlet url mappings in web.xml used?\n\nWith that in mind, a common mistake is to register the DispatcherServlet with a url mapping of /*, returning a view name from a @RequestMapping handler method, and expecting a JSP to be rendered. For example, consider a handler method like\n@RequestMapping(path = &quot;/example&quot;, method = RequestMethod.GET)\npublic String example() {\n    return &quot;example-view-name&quot;;\n}\n\nwith an InternalResourceViewResolver\n@Bean\npublic InternalResourceViewResolver resolver() {\n    InternalResourceViewResolver vr = new InternalResourceViewResolver();\n    vr.setPrefix(&quot;/WEB-INF/jsps/&quot;);\n    vr.setSuffix(&quot;.jsp&quot;);\n    return vr;\n}\n\nyou might expect the request to be forwarded to a JSP resource at the path /WEB-INF/jsps/example-view-name.jsp. This won&apos;t happen. Instead, assuming a context name of Example, the DisaptcherServlet will report\n\nNo mapping found for HTTP request with URI [/Example/WEB-INF/jsps/example-view-name.jsp] in DispatcherServlet with name &apos;dispatcher&apos;\n\nBecause the DispatcherServlet is mapped to /* and /* matches everything (except exact matches, which have higher priority), the DispatcherServlet would be chosen to handle the forward from the JstlView (returned by the InternalResourceViewResolver). In almost every case, the DispatcherServlet will not be configured to handle such a request.\nInstead, in this simplistic case, you should register the DispatcherServlet to /, marking it as the default servlet. The default servlet is the last match for a request. This will allow your typical servlet container to chose an internal Servlet implementation, mapped to *.jsp, to handle the JSP resource (for example, Tomcat has JspServlet), before trying with the default servlet.\nThat&apos;s what you&apos;re seeing in your example.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I resolved my issue when in addition to described before:`\n\n@Bean\npublic InternalResourceViewResolver resolver() {\n    InternalResourceViewResolver vr = new InternalResourceViewResolver();\n    vr.setPrefix(&quot;/WEB-INF/jsps/&quot;);\n    vr.setSuffix(&quot;.jsp&quot;);\n    return vr;\n}\n\n\nadded tomcat-embed-jasper:\n\n&lt;dependency&gt;\n       &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.tomcat.embed&lt;/groupId&gt;\n        &lt;artifactId&gt;tomcat-embed-jasper&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n       &lt;scope&gt;provided&lt;/scope&gt;\n&lt;/dependency&gt;\n\n\n`\nfrom: JSP file not rendering in Spring Boot web application\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"In my case, I was following the Interceptors Spring documentation for version 5.1.2 (while using Spring Boot v2.0.4.RELEASE) and the WebConfig class had the annotation @EnableWebMvc, which seemed to be conflicting with something else in my application that was preventing my static assets from being resolved correctly (i.e. no CSS or JS files were being returned to the client).\n\nAfter trying a lot of different things, I tried removing the @EnableWebMvc and it worked!\n\nEdit: Here&apos;s the reference documentation that says you should remove the @EnableWebMvc annotation\n\nApparently in my case at least, I&apos;m already configuring my Spring application (although not by using web.xml or any other static file, it&apos;s definitely programmatically), so it was a conflict there.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Try to amend your code with the following change on your config file.

<p>Your standard Spring MVC application will serve all requests through a <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-servlet" rel="noreferrer"><code>DispatcherServlet</code></a> that you've registered with your Servlet container.</p>
<p>The <code>DispatcherServlet</code> looks at its <code>ApplicationContext</code> and, if available, the <code>ApplicationContext</code> registered with a <code>ContextLoaderListener</code> for special beans it needs to setup its request serving logic. <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-servlet-special-bean-types" rel="noreferrer">These beans are described in the documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Arguably the most important, beans of type <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-handlermapping" rel="noreferrer"><code>HandlerMapping</code></a> map</p>
<blockquote>
<p>incoming requests to handlers and a list of pre- and post-processors
(handler interceptors) based on some criteria the details of which
vary by <code>HandlerMapping</code> implementation. The most popular implementation
supports annotated controllers but other implementations exists as
well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/HandlerMapping.html" rel="noreferrer">javadoc of <code>HandlerMapping</code></a> further describes how implementations must behave.</p>
<p>The <code>DispatcherServlet</code> finds all beans of this type and registers them in some order (can be customized). While serving a request, the <code>DispatcherServlet</code> loops through these <code>HandlerMapping</code> objects and tests each of them with <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/HandlerMapping.html#getHandler-javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest-" rel="noreferrer"><code>getHandler</code></a> to find one that can handle the incoming request, represented as the standard <code>HttpServletRequest</code>. As of 4.3.x, <strong>if it doesn't find any</strong>, it <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/4.3.x/spring-webmvc/src/main/java/org/springframework/web/servlet/DispatcherServlet.java#L1176" rel="noreferrer">logs the warning</a> that you see</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No mapping found for HTTP request with URI <code>[/some/path]</code> in <code>DispatcherServlet</code> with name SomeName</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/DispatcherServlet.html#setThrowExceptionIfNoHandlerFound-boolean-" rel="noreferrer">either</a> throws a <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/NoHandlerFoundException.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>NoHandlerFoundException</code></a> or immediately commits the response with a 404 Not Found status code.</p>
<h1>Why didn't the <code>DispatcherServlet</code> find a <code>HandlerMapping</code> that could handle my request?</h1>
<p>The most common <code>HandlerMapping</code> implementation is <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/method/annotation/RequestMappingHandlerMapping.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>RequestMappingHandlerMapping</code></a>, which handles registering <code>@Controller</code> beans as handlers (really their <code>@RequestMapping</code> annotated methods). You can either declare a bean of this type yourself (with <code>@Bean</code> or <code>&lt;bean&gt;</code> or other mechanism) or you can use <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-config-enable" rel="noreferrer">the built-in options</a>. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Annotate your <code>@Configuration</code> class with <code>@EnableWebMvc</code>.</li>
<li>Declare a <code>&lt;mvc:annotation-driven /&gt;</code> member in your XML configuration.</li>
</ol>
<p>As the link above describes, both of these will register a <code>RequestMappingHandlerMapping</code> bean (and a bunch of other stuff). However, a <code>HandlerMapping</code> isn't very useful without a handler. <code>RequestMappingHandlerMapping</code> expects some <code>@Controller</code> beans so you need to declare those too, through <code>@Bean</code> methods in a Java configuration or <code>&lt;bean&gt;</code> declarations in an XML configuration or through component scanning of <code>@Controller</code> annotated classes in either. <strong>Make sure these beans are present.</strong></p>
<p>If you're getting the warning message and a 404 and you've configured all of the above correctly, <strong>then you're sending your request to the wrong URI</strong>, one that isn't handled by a detected <code>@RequestMapping</code> annotated handler method.</p>
<p>The <code>spring-webmvc</code> library offers other built-in <code>HandlerMapping</code> implementations. For example, <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/handler/BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping</code></a> maps</p>
<blockquote>
<p>from URLs to beans with names that start with a slash ("/")</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and you can always write your own. Obviously, <strong>you'll have to make sure the request you're sending matches at least one of the registered <code>HandlerMapping</code> object's handlers.</strong></p>
<p>If you don't implicitly or explicitly register any <code>HandlerMapping</code> beans (or if <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/DispatcherServlet.html#setDetectAllHandlerAdapters-boolean-" rel="noreferrer"><code>detectAllHandlerMappings</code></a> is <code>true</code>), the <code>DispatcherServlet</code> registers some <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html#mvc-servlet-config" rel="noreferrer">defaults</a>. These are defined in <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/4.3.x/spring-webmvc/src/main/resources/org/springframework/web/servlet/DispatcherServlet.properties" rel="noreferrer"><code>DispatcherServlet.properties</code></a> in the same package as the <code>DispatcherServlet</code> class. They are <code>BeanNameUrlHandlerMapping</code> and <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/annotation/DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>DefaultAnnotationHandlerMapping</code></a> (which is similar to <code>RequestMappingHandlerMapping</code> but deprecated).</p>
<h1>Debugging</h1>
<p>Spring MVC will log handlers registered through <code>RequestMappingHandlerMapping</code>. For example, a <code>@Controller</code> like</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-meta">@Controller</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">ExampleController</span> {
    <span class="hljs-meta">@RequestMapping(path = "/example", method = RequestMethod.GET, headers = "X-Custom")</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> String <span class="hljs-title function_">example</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-string">"example-view-name"</span>;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>will log the following at INFO level</p>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>Mapped "{[/example],methods=[GET],headers=[X-Custom]}" onto public java.lang.String com.spring.servlet.ExampleController.example()
</code></pre>
<p>This describes the mapping registered. When you see the warning that no handler was found, compare the URI in the message to the mapping listed here. All the restrictions specified in the <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RequestMapping.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>@RequestMapping</code></a> must match for Spring MVC to select the handler.</p>
<p>Other <code>HandlerMapping</code> implementations log their own statements that should hint to their mappings and their corresponding handlers.</p>
<p>Similarly, enable Spring logging at DEBUG level to see which beans Spring registers. It should report which annotated classes it finds, which packages it scans, and which beans it initializes. If the ones you expected aren't present, then review your <code>ApplicationContext</code> configuration.</p>
<h1>Other common mistakes</h1>
<p>A <code>DispatcherServlet</code> is just a typical Java EE <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/Servlet.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>Servlet</code></a>. You register it with your typical <code>&lt;web.xml&gt;</code> <code>&lt;servlet-class&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;</code> declaration, or directly through <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/ServletContext.html#addServlet-java.lang.String-java.lang.Class-" rel="noreferrer"><code>ServletContext#addServlet</code></a> in a <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/WebApplicationInitializer.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>WebApplicationInitializer</code></a>, or with whatever mechanism Spring boot uses. As such, you must rely on the <em>url mapping</em> logic specified in the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/servlet-3.0-fr-oth-JSpec/" rel="noreferrer">Servlet specification</a>, see Chapter 12. See also</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15385596/how-are-servlet-url-mappings-in-web-xml-used">How are Servlet url mappings in web.xml used?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>With that in mind, a common mistake is to register the <code>DispatcherServlet</code> with a url mapping of <code>/*</code>, returning a view name from a <code>@RequestMapping</code> handler method, and expecting a JSP to be rendered. For example, consider a handler method like</p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-meta">@RequestMapping(path = "/example", method = RequestMethod.GET)</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> String <span class="hljs-title function_">example</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-string">"example-view-name"</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>with an <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/InternalResourceViewResolver.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>InternalResourceViewResolver</code></a></p>
<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-meta">@Bean</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> InternalResourceViewResolver <span class="hljs-title function_">resolver</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> {
    <span class="hljs-type">InternalResourceViewResolver</span> <span class="hljs-variable">vr</span> <span class="hljs-operator">=</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">InternalResourceViewResolver</span>();
    vr.setPrefix(<span class="hljs-string">"/WEB-INF/jsps/"</span>);
    vr.setSuffix(<span class="hljs-string">".jsp"</span>);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> vr;
}
</code></pre>
<p>you might expect the request to be <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/RequestDispatcher.html#forward-javax.servlet.ServletRequest-javax.servlet.ServletResponse-" rel="noreferrer">forwarded</a> to a JSP resource at the path <code>/WEB-INF/jsps/example-view-name.jsp</code>. This won't happen. Instead, assuming a context name of <code>Example</code>, the <code>DisaptcherServlet</code> will report</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No mapping found for HTTP request with URI <code>[/Example/WEB-INF/jsps/example-view-name.jsp]</code> in <code>DispatcherServlet</code> with name 'dispatcher'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the <code>DispatcherServlet</code> is mapped to <code>/*</code> and <code>/*</code> matches everything (except exact matches, which have higher priority), the <code>DispatcherServlet</code> would be chosen to handle the <code>forward</code> from the <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/JstlView.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>JstlView</code></a> (returned by the <code>InternalResourceViewResolver</code>). <strong>In almost every case, the <code>DispatcherServlet</code> will not be configured to handle such a request</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead, in this simplistic case, you should register the <code>DispatcherServlet</code> to <code>/</code>, marking it as the default servlet. The default servlet is the last match for a request. This will allow your typical servlet container to chose an internal Servlet implementation, mapped to <code>*.jsp</code>, to handle the JSP resource (for example, Tomcat has <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/api/org/apache/jasper/servlet/JspServlet.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>JspServlet</code></a>), before trying with the default servlet.</p>
<p>That's what you're seeing in your example.</p>

<p>In my case, I was following the <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.1.2.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-config-interceptors" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Interceptors Spring documentation for version 5.1.2</a> (while using <strong>Spring Boot v2.0.4.RELEASE</strong>) and the <code>WebConfig</code> class had the annotation <code>@EnableWebMvc</code>, which seemed to be conflicting with something else in my application that was preventing my static assets from being resolved correctly (i.e. no CSS or JS files were being returned to the client).</p>

<p>After trying a lot of different things, I tried <em>removing</em> the <code>@EnableWebMvc</code> and it worked!</p>

<p>Edit: <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.4.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-spring-mvc-auto-configuration" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here's the reference documentation</a> that says you should remove the <code>@EnableWebMvc</code> annotation</p>

<p>Apparently in my case at least, I'm already configuring my Spring application (although not by using <code>web.xml</code> or any other static file, it's definitely programmatically), so it was a conflict there.</p>

<p>I came across another reason for the same error. This could also be due to the class files not generated for your controller.java file. As a result of which the  the dispatcher servlet mentioned in web.xml is unable to map it to the appropriate  method in the controller class.</p>

<p>For me, I found that my target classes were generated in a folder pattern not same as source. This is possibly in eclipse I add folders for containing my controllers and not add them as packages. So I ended up defining incorrect path in spring config.</p>

<p>My target class was generating classes under app and I was referring to com.happy.app</p>

<p>I added packages (not folders) for com.happy.app and moved the files from folders to packages in eclipse and it resolved the issue.</p>

<p>In my case, I was playing around with import of secondary java config files into a main java config file.  While making secondary config files, I had changed the name of the main config class, but I had failed to update the name in web.xml.  So, every time that I had restarted my tomcat server, I was not seeing mapping handlers noted in the Eclipse IDE console, and when I tried to navigate to my home page I was seeing this error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nov 1, 2019 11:00:01 PM org.springframework.web.servlet.PageNotFound
  noHandlerFound WARNING: No mapping found for HTTP request with URI
  [/webapp/home/index] in DispatcherServlet with name 'dispatcher'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fix was to update the web.xml file so that the old name "WebConfig" would be instead "MainConfig", simply renaming it to reflect the latest name of the main java config file (where "MainConfig" is arbitrary and the words "Web" and "Main" used here are not a syntax requirement).  MainConfig was important, because it was the file that did the component scan for "WebController", my spring mvc controller class that handles my web requests.</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java"><span class="hljs-meta">@ComponentScan(basePackageClasses={WebController.class})</span>
</code></pre>

<p>web.xml had this:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">&lt;init-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;contextConfigLocation&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;
        com.lionheart.fourthed.config.WebConfig
    &lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/init-param&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>web.xml file now has:</p>

<pre class="lang-java s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-java">&lt;init-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;contextConfigLocation&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;
        com.lionheart.fourthed.config.MainConfig
    &lt;/param-value&gt;
&lt;/init-param&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now I am seeing the mapping in the console window:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>INFO: Mapped "{[/home/index],methods=[GET]}" onto public
  org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView
  com.lionheart.fourthed.controller.WebController.gotoIndex()</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And my web page is loading again.</p>

<h2>For me, the issue was hidden in the <em>web.xml</em> file.</h2>
<p>Inside the servlet tag, you'll find:</p>

<p>Make sure that in the <code>&lt;param-value&gt;</code> you have kept the correct location of the dispatcher servlet (aka Front Controller).</p>
<p>I had kept an incorrect location, hence I was able to view the homepage but all other pages were giving HTTP 404 error.</p>

<p>In my case, I had created Config.java (class) and also config.xml and mapping was done partially in both of them. And since config.java uses @Configuration annotation , it was considered priority. And was not considering config.xml.
If anyone gets in trouble like this , just delete config.java with annotation and try to keep config.xml , it works fine.</p>
