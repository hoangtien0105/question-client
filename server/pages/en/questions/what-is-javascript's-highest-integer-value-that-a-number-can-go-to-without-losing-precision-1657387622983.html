Let&apos;s see how 9,007,199,254,740,992 be held (represented) by using this binary format.\nUsing a brief version to demonstrate it from 4,503,599,627,370,496:\n  1 . 0000 ---- 0000  *  2^52            =&gt;  1  0000 ---- 0000.  \n     |-- 52 bits --|    |exponent part|        |-- 52 bits --|\n\nOn the left side of the arrow, we have bit value 1, and an adjacent radix point. By consuming the exponent part on the left, the radix point is moved 52 steps to the right. The radix point ends up at the end, and we get 4503599627370496 in pure binary.\nNow let&apos;s keep incrementing the fraction part with 1 until all the bits are set to 1, which equals 9,007,199,254,740,991 in decimal.\n  1 . 0000 ---- 0000  *  2^52  =&gt;  1  0000 ---- 0000.  \n                       (+1)\n  1 . 0000 ---- 0001  *  2^52  =&gt;  1  0000 ---- 0001.  \n                       (+1)\n  1 . 0000 ---- 0010  *  2^52  =&gt;  1  0000 ---- 0010.  \n                       (+1)\n                        . \n                        .\n                        .\n  1 . 1111 ---- 1111  *  2^52  =&gt;  1  1111 ---- 1111. \n\nBecause the 64-bit double-precision format strictly allots 52 bits for the fraction part, no more bits are available if we add another 1, so what we can do is setting all bits back to 0, and manipulate the exponent part:\n   This bit is implicit and persistent.\n          \n  1 . 1111 ---- 1111  *  2^52      =&gt;  1  1111 ---- 1111. \n     |-- 52 bits --|                     |-- 52 bits --|\n\n                          (+1)\n\n  1 . 0000 ---- 0000  *  2^52 * 2  =&gt;  1  0000 ---- 0000. * 2  \n     |-- 52 bits --|                     |-- 52 bits --|\n                                      (By consuming the 2^52, radix\n                                       point has no way to go, but\n                                       there is still one 2 left in\n                                       exponent part)\n  =&gt;  1 . 0000 ---- 0000  *  2^53 \n         |-- 52 bits --| \n\nNow we get the  9,007,199,254,740,992, and for the numbers greater than it, the format can only handle increments of 2 because every increment of 1 on the fraction part ends up being multiplied by the left 2 in the exponent part.

<p>JavaScript has two number types: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number" rel="noreferrer"><code>Number</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/BigInt" rel="noreferrer"><code>BigInt</code></a>. </p>

<p>The most frequently-used number type, <code>Number</code>, is a 64-bit floating point <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754" rel="noreferrer">IEEE 754</a> number. </p>

<p>The largest exact integral value of this type is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER" rel="noreferrer"><code>Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER</code></a>, which is:</p>

<ul>
<li>2<sup>53</sup>-1, or </li>
<li>+/- 9,007,199,254,740,991, or</li>
<li>nine quadrillion seven trillion one hundred ninety-nine billion two hundred fifty-four million seven hundred forty thousand nine hundred ninety-one </li>
</ul>

<p>To put this in perspective: one quadrillion bytes is a petabyte (or one thousand terabytes).</p>

<p>"Safe" in this context refers to the ability to represent integers exactly and to correctly compare them.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-ecmascript-language-types-number-type" rel="noreferrer">From the spec:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that all the positive and negative integers whose magnitude is no
  greater than 2<sup>53</sup> are representable in the <code>Number</code> type (indeed, the
  integer 0 has two representations, +0 and -0).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To safely use integers larger than this, you need to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt" rel="noreferrer"><code>BigInt</code></a>, which has no upper bound. </p>

<p>Note that the bitwise operators and shift operators operate on 32-bit integers, so in that case, the max safe integer is 2<sup>31</sup>-1, or 2,147,483,647.  </p>

<hr>

<p>Technical note on the subject of the number 9,007,199,254,740,992: There is an exact IEEE-754 representation of this value, and you can assign and read this value from a variable, so for <em>very carefully</em> chosen applications in the domain of integers less than or equal to this value, you could treat this as a maximum value.</p>

<p>In the general case, you must treat this IEEE-754 value as inexact, because it is ambiguous whether it is encoding the logical value 9,007,199,254,740,992 or  9,007,199,254,740,993. </p>

<p>We can see that among numbers greater than <em><strong>9,007,199,254,740,992</strong></em>, only even numbers are <strong>representable</strong>.</p>
<p>It's an entry to explain how the <strong>double-precision 64-bit binary format</strong> works. Let's see how <em><strong>9,007,199,254,740,992</strong></em> be held (represented) by using this binary format.</p>
<p>Using a brief version to demonstrate it from <em><strong>4,503,599,627,370,496</strong></em>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">  <span class="hljs-number">1</span> . <span class="hljs-number">0000</span> ---- <span class="hljs-number">0000</span>  *  <span class="hljs-number">2</span>^<span class="hljs-number">52</span>            =&gt;  <span class="hljs-number">1</span>  <span class="hljs-number">0000</span> ---- <span class="hljs-number">0000</span>.  
     |-- <span class="hljs-number">52</span> bits --|    |exponent part|        |-- <span class="hljs-number">52</span> bits --|
</code></pre>
<p>On the left side of the arrow, we have <strong>bit value 1</strong>, and an adjacent <strong>radix point</strong>. By consuming the exponent part on the left, the radix point is moved 52 steps to the right. The radix point ends up at the end, and we get 4503599627370496 in pure binary.</p>
<p>Now let's keep incrementing the fraction part with 1 until all the bits are set to 1, which equals <em><strong>9,007,199,254,740,991</strong></em> in decimal.</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">  <span class="hljs-number">1</span> . <span class="hljs-number">0000</span> ---- <span class="hljs-number">0000</span>  *  <span class="hljs-number">2</span>^<span class="hljs-number">52</span>  =&gt;  <span class="hljs-number">1</span>  <span class="hljs-number">0000</span> ---- <span class="hljs-number">0000</span>.

<p>Because the 64-bit double-precision format strictly allots 52 bits for the fraction part, no more bits are available if we add another 1, so what we can do is setting all bits back to 0, and manipulate the exponent part:</p>

<p>Now we get the  <em><strong>9,007,199,254,740,992</strong></em>, and for the numbers greater than it, the format can only handle increments of 2 because every increment of 1 on the fraction part ends up being multiplied by the left 2 in the exponent part. That's why <strong>double-precision 64-bit binary format</strong> cannot hold odd numbers when the number is greater than <em><strong>9,007,199,254,740,992</strong></em>:</p>

<li>Most of your loops don't run for 28.56 years</li>
<li><code>9007199254740992 === Math.pow(2, 53) + 1</code> is proof enough</li>
<li>You should stick to <code>4294967295</code> which is <code>Math.pow(2,32) - 1</code> as to avoid expected issues with bit-shifting</li>

<p>The short answer is it depends.</p>

<p>If youre using bitwise operators anywhere (or if youre referring to the length of an Array), the ranges are:</p>

<p>Unsigned: <code>0(-1&gt;&gt;&gt;0)</code></p>

<p>Signed: <code>(-(-1&gt;&gt;&gt;1)-1)(-1&gt;&gt;&gt;1)</code></p>

<p>(It so happens that the bitwise operators and the maximum length of an array are restricted to 32-bit integers.)</p>

<p>If youre not using bitwise operators or working with array lengths:</p>

<p>Signed: <code>(-Math.pow(2,53))(+Math.pow(2,53))</code></p>

<p>These limitations are imposed by the internal representation of the Number type, which generally corresponds to IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point representation. (Note that unlike typical signed integers, the magnitude of the negative limit is the same as the magnitude of the positive limit, due to characteristics of the internal representation, which actually includes a <em>negative</em> 0!)</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>MAX_SAFE_INTEGER</code> constant has a value of <code>9007199254740991</code> (9,007,199,254,740,991 or ~9 quadrillion). The reasoning behind that number is that JavaScript uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format" rel="nofollow noreferrer">double-precision floating-point format numbers</a> as specified in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754" rel="nofollow noreferrer">IEEE 754</a> and can only safely represent numbers between <code>-(2^53 - 1)</code> and <code>2^53 - 1</code>.</p>
<p>Safe in this context refers to the ability to represent integers exactly and to correctly compare them. For example, <code>Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER + 1 === Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER + 2</code> will evaluate to true, which is mathematically incorrect. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/isSafeInteger" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Number.isSafeInteger()</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Because <code>MAX_SAFE_INTEGER</code> is a static property of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Number</a>, you always use it as <code>Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER</code>, rather than as a property of a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Number</a> object you created.</p>

<p>Hex-Decimals are unsigned positive values, so 0x80000000 = 2147483648 - thats mathematically correct. If you want to make it a signed value you have to right shift: 0x80000000 &gt;&gt; 0 = -2147483648. You can write 1 &lt;&lt; 31 instead, too.</p>
