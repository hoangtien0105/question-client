I&apos;ll not duplicate here.\nI&apos;d like to address the difference between using forEach and for loop when it comes to async and await\nhow forEach works\nLet&apos;s look at how forEach works. According to ECMAScript Specification, MDN provides an implementation which can be used as a polyfill. I copy it and paste here with comments removal.\nArray.prototype.forEach = function (callback, thisArg) {\n  if (this == null) { throw new TypeError(&apos;Array.prototype.forEach called on null or undefined&apos;); }\n  var T, k;\n  var O = Object(this);\n  var len = O.length &gt;&gt;&gt; 0;\n  if (typeof callback !== &quot;function&quot;) { throw new TypeError(callback + &apos; is not a function&apos;); }\n  if (arguments.length &gt; 1) { T = thisArg; }\n  k = 0;\n  while (k &lt; len) {\n    var kValue;\n    if (k in O) {\n      kValue = O[k];\n      callback.call(T, kValue, k, O); // pay attention to this line\n    }\n    k++;\n  }\n};\n\nLet&apos;s back to your code, let&apos;s extract the callback as a function.\nasync function callback(file){\n  const contents = await fs.readFile(file, &apos;utf8&apos;)\n  console.log(contents)\n}\n\nSo, basically callback returns a promise since it&apos;s declared with async. Inside forEach, callback is just called in a normal way, if the callback itself returns a promise, the javascript engine will not wait it to be resolved or rejected. Instead, it puts the promise in a job queue, and continues executing the loop.\nHow about await fs.readFile(file, &apos;utf8&apos;) inside the callback?\nBasically, when your async callback gets the chance to be executed, the js engine will pause until fs.readFile(file, &apos;utf8&apos;) to be resolved or rejected, and resume execution of the async function after fulfillment. So the contents variable store the actual result from fs.readFile, not a promise. So, console.log(contents) logs out the file content not a Promise\nWhy for ... of works?\nwhen we write a generic for of loop, we gain more control than forEach. Let&apos;s refactor printFiles.\nasync function printFiles () {\n  const files = await getFilePaths() // Assume this works fine\n\n  for (const file of files) {\n    const contents = await fs.readFile(file, &apos;utf8&apos;)\n    console.log(contents)\n    // or await callback(file)\n  }\n}\n\nWhen evaluate for loop, we have await promise inside the async function, the execution will pause until the await promise is settled. So, you can think of that the files are read one by one in a determined order.\nExecute sequentially\nSometimes, we really need the the async functions to be executed in a sequential order. For example, I have a few new records stored in an array to be saved to database, and I want them to be saved in sequential order which means first record in array should be saved first, then second, until last one is saved.\nHere is an example:\n\n\nconst records = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n\nasync function saveRecord(record) {\n  return new Promise((resolved, rejected) =&gt; {\n    setTimeout(()=&gt; {\n      resolved(`record ${record} saved`)\n    }, Math.random() * 500)\n  });\n}\n\nasync function forEachSaveRecords(records) {\n  records.forEach(async (record) =&gt; {\n    const res = await saveRecord(record);\n    console.log(res);\n  })\n}\n\nasync function forofSaveRecords(records) {\n  for (const record of records) {\n    const res = await saveRecord(record);\n    console.log(res);\n  }\n}\n(async () =&gt; {\n  console.log(&quot;=== for of save records ===&quot;)\n  await forofSaveRecords(records)\n  \n  console.log(&quot;=== forEach save records ===&quot;)\n  await forEachSaveRecords(records)\n})()\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\nI use setTimeout to simulate the process of saving a record to database - it&apos;s asynchronous and cost a random time. Using forEach, the records are saved in an undetermined order, but using for..of, they are saved sequentially.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution7","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"This solution is also memory-optimized so you can run it on 10,000&apos;s of data items and requests.

As a result, all the fs.readFile functions\nare invoked in the same round of the event loop, which means they are started in parallel, not in sequential, and the execution continues immediately after invoking forEach(), without\nwaiting for all the fs.readFile operations to complete.

Therefore promises is an array of Promise objects, which can be sent to Promise.all().\n\nIn @Bergis answer, the console may log file contents in the order theyre read. For example if a really small file finishes reading before a really large file, it will be logged first, even if the small file comes after the large file in the files array.

After the await defers the continuation of the async function, execution of subsequent statements ensues. If this await is the last expression executed by its function execution continues by returning to the function&apos;s caller a pending Promise for completion of the await&apos;s function and resuming execution of that caller.\n\nSo if you have the following, the numbers won&apos;t be logged before &quot;b&quot;:\nconst delay = (ms) =&gt; {\n  return new Promise((resolve) =&gt; {\n    setTimeout(resolve, ms);\n  });\n};\n\nconst logNumbers = async () =&gt; {\n  console.log(1);\n  await delay(2000);\n  console.log(2);\n  await delay(2000);\n  console.log(3);\n};\n\nconst main = () =&gt; {\n  console.log(&quot;a&quot;);\n  logNumbers();\n  console.log(&quot;b&quot;);\n};\n\nmain();\n\nCircling back to forEach, forEach is like main and logFile is like logNumbers. main won&apos;t stop just because logNumbers does some awaiting, and forEach won&apos;t stop just because logFile does some awaiting.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution26","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Similar to Antonio Val&apos;s p-iteration, an alternative npm module is async-af:\n\nconst AsyncAF = require(&apos;async-af&apos;);\nconst fs = require(&apos;fs-promise&apos;);\n\nfunction printFiles() {\n  // since AsyncAF accepts promises or non-promises, there&apos;s no need to await here\n  const files = getFilePaths();\n\n  AsyncAF(files).forEach(async file =&gt; {\n    const contents = await fs.readFile(file, &apos;utf8&apos;);\n    console.log(contents);\n  });\n}\n\nprintFiles();\n\n\nAlternatively, async-af has a static method (log/logAF) that logs the results of promises:\n\nconst AsyncAF = require(&apos;async-af&apos;);\nconst fs = require(&apos;fs-promise&apos;);\n\nfunction printFiles() {\n  const files = getFilePaths();\n\n  AsyncAF(files).forEach(file =&gt; {\n    AsyncAF.log(fs.readFile(file, &apos;utf8&apos;));\n  });\n}\n\nprintFiles();\n\n\nHowever, the main advantage of the library is that you can chain asynchronous methods to do something like:\n\nconst aaf = require(&apos;async-af&apos;);\nconst fs = require(&apos;fs-promise&apos;);\n\nconst printFiles = () =&gt; aaf(getFilePaths())\n  .map(file =&gt; fs.readFile(file, &apos;utf8&apos;))\n  .forEach(file =&gt; aaf.log(file));\n\nprintFiles();\n\n\nasync-af\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution27","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"In 2022 I would still advise using external libraries to handle all this async flow.

<p>This code does work, but could something go wrong with this? I had someone tell me that you're not supposed to use <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> in a higher-order function like this, so I just wanted to ask if there was any issue with this.</p>

<p>Sure the code does work, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't do what you expect it to do. It just fires off multiple asynchronous calls, but the <code>printFiles</code> function does immediately return after that.</p>

<h3>Reading in sequence</h3>

<p>If you want to read the files in sequence, <strong>you cannot use <code>forEach</code></strong> indeed. Just use a modern <code>for  of</code> loop instead, in which <code>await</code> will work as expected:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">printFiles</span> () {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> files = <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">getFilePaths</span>();

  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> file <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> files) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> contents = <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> fs.<span class="hljs-title function_">readFile</span>(file, <span class="hljs-string">'utf8'</span>);
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(contents);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Reading in parallel</h3>

<p>If you want to read the files in parallel, <strong>you cannot use <code>forEach</code></strong> indeed. Each of the <code>async</code> callback function calls does return a promise, but you're throwing them away instead of awaiting them. Just use <code>map</code> instead, and you can await the array of promises that you'll get with <code>Promise.all</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">printFiles</span> () {

<h2>Picture worth 1000 words - For Sequential Approach Only</h2>

<p>Let's back to your code, let's extract the callback as a function.</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">callback</span>(<span class="hljs-params">file</span>){
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> contents = <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> fs.<span class="hljs-title function_">readFile</span>(file, <span class="hljs-string">'utf8'</span>)
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(contents)
}
</code></pre>
<p>So, basically <code>callback</code> returns a promise since it's declared with <code>async</code>. Inside <code>forEach</code>, <code>callback</code> is just called in a normal way, if the callback itself returns a promise, the javascript engine will not wait it to be resolved or rejected. Instead, it puts the <code>promise</code> in a job queue, and continues executing the loop.</p>
<p><strong>How about <code>await fs.readFile(file, 'utf8')</code> inside the <code>callback</code>?</strong></p>
<p>Basically, when your async <code>callback</code> gets the chance to be executed, the js engine will pause until <code>fs.readFile(file, 'utf8')</code> to be resolved or rejected, and resume execution of the async function after fulfillment. So the <code>contents</code> variable store the actual result from <code>fs.readFile</code>, not a <code>promise</code>. So, <code>console.log(contents)</code> logs out the file content not a <code>Promise</code></p>
<p><strong>Why <code>for ... of</code> works?</strong></p>
<p>when we write a generic <code>for of</code> loop, we gain more control than <code>forEach</code>. Let's refactor <code>printFiles</code>.</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">printFiles</span> () {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> files = <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">getFilePaths</span>() <span class="hljs-comment">// Assume this works fine</span>

  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> file <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> files) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> contents = <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> fs.<span class="hljs-title function_">readFile</span>(file, <span class="hljs-string">'utf8'</span>)
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(contents)
    <span class="hljs-comment">// or await callback(file)</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>When evaluate <code>for</code> loop, we have <code>await</code> promise inside the <code>async</code> function, the execution will pause until the <code>await</code> promise is settled. So, you can think of that the files are read one by one in a determined order.</p>
<p><strong>Execute sequentially</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, we really need the the async functions to be executed in a sequential order. For example, I have a few new records stored in an array to be saved to database, and I want them to be saved in sequential order which means first record in array should be saved first, then second, until last one is saved.</p>

<p>I use <code>setTimeout</code> to simulate the process of saving a record to database - it's asynchronous and cost a random time. Using <code>forEach</code>, the records are saved in an undetermined order, but using <code>for..of</code>, they are saved sequentially.</p>

<p>The issue is, the promise returned by the iteration function is ignored by <code>forEach()</code>. As a result, all the <code>fs.readFile</code> functions
are invoked in the same round of the event loop, which means they are started in parallel, not in sequential, and the execution continues immediately after invoking forEach(), without
waiting for all the <code>fs.readFile</code> operations to complete. Since forEach does not wait for each promise to resolve, the loop actually finishes iterating before promises are resolved.  You may end up trying to access values that are not available yet.</p>

<p>In addition to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/37576787/877703">@Bergis answer</a>, Id like to offer a third alternative. It's very similar to @Bergis 2nd example, but instead of awaiting each <code>readFile</code> individually, you create an array of promises, each which you await at the end.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> fs <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">'fs-promise'</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">printFiles</span> () {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> files = <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">getFilePaths</span>();

  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> promises = files.<span class="hljs-title function_">map</span>(<span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">file</span>) =&gt;</span> fs.<span class="hljs-title function_">readFile</span>(file, <span class="hljs-string">'utf8'</span>))

  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> contents = <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Promise</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">all</span>(promises)

  contents.<span class="hljs-title function_">forEach</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-property">log</span>);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the function passed to <code>.map()</code> does not need to be <code>async</code>, since <code>fs.readFile</code> returns a Promise object anyway. Therefore <code>promises</code> is an array of Promise objects, which can be sent to <code>Promise.all()</code>.</p>

<p>In @Bergis answer, the console may log file contents in the order theyre read. For example if a really small file finishes reading before a really large file, it will be logged first, even if the small file comes <em>after</em> the large file in the <code>files</code> array. However, in my method above, you are guaranteed the console will log the files in the same order as the provided array.</p>

<p>A simple drop-in solution for replacing a <code>forEach()</code> await loop that is not working is replacing <code>forEach</code> with <code>map</code> and adding <code>Promise.all(</code> to the beginning.</p>

<p><code>await y.forEach(async (x) =&gt; {</code></p>

<p>it's pretty painless to pop a couple methods in a file that will handle asynchronous data in a serialized order and give a more conventional flavour to your code.  For example:</p>

<p>One important <strong>caveat</strong> is: The <code>await + for .. of</code> method and the <code>forEach + async</code> way actually have different effect. </p>

<p>Having <code>await</code> inside a real <code>for</code> loop will make sure all async calls are executed one by one. And the <code>forEach + async</code> way will fire off all promises at the same time, which is faster but sometimes overwhelmed(<strong>if you do some DB query or visit some web services with volume restrictions</strong> and do not want to fire 100,000 calls at a time). </p>

<p>You can also use <code>reduce + promise</code>(less elegant) if you do not use <code>async/await</code> and want to make sure files are read <strong>one after another</strong>. </p>

<p>Node supports top-level await (this doesn't have a plugin yet, won't have and can be enabled via harmony flags), it's cool but doesn't solve one problem (strategically I work only on LTS versions). How to get the files?</p>

<p>Using composition. Given the code, causes to me a sensation that this is inside a module, so, should have a function to do it. If not, you should use an IIFE to wrap the role code into an async function creating simple module that's do all for you, or you can go with the right way, there is, composition.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// more complex version with IIFE to a single module</span>

<p>Note that the name of variable changes due to semantics. You pass a functor (a function that can be invoked by another function) and recieves a pointer on memory that contains the initial block of logic of the application.</p>

<p>But, if's not a module and you need to export the logic?</p>

<p>Wrap the functions in a async function.</p>

<p>To see how that can go wrong, print console.log at the end of the method.</p>

<p>Things that can go wrong in general:</p>

<ul>
<li>Arbitrary order.</li>
<li>printFiles can finish running before printing files.</li>
<li>Poor performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are not always wrong but frequently are in standard use cases.</p>

<p>Generally, using forEach will result in all but the last. It'll call each function without awaiting for the function meaning it tells all of the functions to start then finishes without waiting for the functions to finish.</p>

<p>This is an example in native JS that will preserve order, prevent the function from returning prematurely and in theory retain optimal performance.</p>

<p>This will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Initiate all of the file reads to happen in parallel.</li>
<li>Preserve the order via the use of map to map file names to promises to wait for.</li>
<li>Wait for each promise in the order defined by the array.</li>
</ul>

<p>With this solution the first file will be shown as soon as it is available without having to wait for the others to be available first.</p>

<p>It will also be loading all files at the same time rather than having to wait for the first to finish before the second file read can be started.</p>

<p>The only draw back of this and the original version is that if multiple reads are started at once then it's more difficult to handle errors on account of having more errors that can happen at a time.</p>

<p>With versions that read a file at a time then then will stop on a failure without wasting time trying to read any more files. Even with an elaborate cancellation system it can be hard to avoid it failing on the first file but reading most of the other files already as well.</p>

<p>Performance is not always predictable. While many systems will be faster with parallel file reads some will prefer sequential. Some are dynamic and may shift under load, optimisations that offer latency do not always yield good throughput under heavy contention.</p>

<p>There is also no error handling in that example. If something requires them to either all be successfully shown or not at all it won't do that.</p>

<p>In depth experimentation is recommended with console.log at each stage and fake file read solutions (random delay instead). Although many solutions appear to do the same in simple cases all have subtle differences that take some extra scrutiny to squeeze out.</p>

<p>Use this mock to help tell the difference between solutions:</p>

<p>Here is how you'd set this up</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> fs <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">'fs'</span>;

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> readFile = <span class="hljs-title function_">future</span>(fs.<span class="hljs-property">readFile</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>Another way to have structured the desired code would be</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">printFiles</span> = files =&gt; 
  <span class="hljs-title class_">List</span>(files).<span class="hljs-title function_">traverse</span>( <span class="hljs-title class_">Task</span>.<span class="hljs-property">of</span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">fn</span> =&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">readFile</span>( fn, <span class="hljs-string">'utf-8'</span>))

</code></pre>

<p>Or perhaps even more functionally oriented</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">// 90% of encodings are utf-8, making that use case super easy is prudent</span>

</code></pre>

<p>If you really wanted more flexibility in encoding, you could just do this (for fun, I'm using the proposed <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pipe Forward operator</a> )</p>

<p>was covered to an extent in @Bergi's <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/37576787/4376643">selected answer</a>,
which showed how to process in serial and in parallel.  However there are other issues noted with parallelism -</p>

<p>For example if a really small file finishes reading before a really large file, it will be logged first, even if the small file comes after the large file in the files array.</p>

</ol>

<p>It is also not good to open thousands of files at once to read them concurrently. One always has to do an assessment whether a sequential, parallel, or mixed approach is better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So let's address these issues showing actual code that is brief and concise, and does <em>not</em> use third party libraries.  Something easily cut, paste, and modifiable.</p>
<h3>Reading in parallel (all at once), printing in serial (as early as possible per file).</h3>
<p>The easiest improvement is perform full parallelism as in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/37576787/4376643">@Bergi's answer</a>, but make a small change so that each file is <em>printed as soon as possible while preserving order</em>.</p>

<p>Above, two seperate branches are run concurrently.</p>
<ul>
<li>branch 1: Reading in parallel, all at once,</li>
<li>branch 2: Reading in serial to force order, but waiting no longer than necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>That was easy.</p>
<h3>Reading in parallel with a concurrency limit, printing in serial (as early as possible per file).</h3>
<p>A "concurrecy limit" means that no more than <code>N</code> files will ever being read at the same time.<br>
Like a store that only allows in so many customers at a time (at least during COVID).</p>

<p>The funciton <code>bootablePromise(kickMe:() =&gt; Promise&lt;any&gt;)</code> takes an
function <code>kickMe</code> as an argumment to start a task (in our case <code>readFile</code>).  But it is not started immediately.</p>
<p><code>bootablePromise</code> returns a couple of properties</p>
<ul>
<li><code>promise</code> of type <code>Promise</code></li>
<li><code>boot</code> of type function <code>()=&gt;void</code></li>

<p><code>promise</code> has two stages in life</p>
<ol>
<li>Being a promise to start a task</li>
<li>Being a promise complete a task it has already started.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>promise</code> transitions from the first to the second state when <code>boot()</code> is called.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>boots</code>: The array of functions to call to force it's corresponding promise to transition. It is used only in branch 1.</li>

<p>As other answers have mentioned, you're probably wanting it to be executed in sequence rather in parallel. Ie. run for first file, wait until it's done, <em>then</em> once it's done run for second file. That's not what will happen.</p>
<p>I think it's important to address <em>why</em> this doesn't happen.</p>
<p>Think about how <code>forEach</code> works. I can't find the source, but I presume it works something like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">forEach</span> = (<span class="hljs-params">arr, cb</span>) =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> i = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; arr.<span class="hljs-property">length</span>; i++) {
    <span class="hljs-title function_">cb</span>(arr[i]);
  }
};
</code></pre>
<p>Now think about what happens when you do something like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title function_">forEach</span>(files, <span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">logFile</span>(<span class="hljs-params">file</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> contents = <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> fs.<span class="hljs-title function_">readFile</span>(file, <span class="hljs-string">'utf8'</span>);
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(contents);
});
</code></pre>
<p>Inside <code>forEach</code>'s <code>for</code> loop we're calling <code>cb(arr[i])</code>, which ends up being <code>logFile(file)</code>. The <code>logFile</code> function has an <code>await</code> inside it, so maybe the <code>for</code> loop will wait for this <code>await</code> before proceeding to <code>i++</code>?</p>
<p>No, it won't. Confusingly, that's not how <code>await</code> works. From <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the docs</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An await splits execution flow, allowing the caller of the async function to resume execution. After the await defers the continuation of the async function, execution of subsequent statements ensues. If this await is the last expression executed by its function execution continues by returning to the function's caller a pending Promise for completion of the await's function and resuming execution of that caller.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you have the following, the numbers won't be logged before <code>"b"</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">delay</span> = (<span class="hljs-params">ms</span>) =&gt; {

    <span class="hljs-built_in">setTimeout</span>(resolve, ms);
  });
};

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">logNumbers</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>);
  <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">delay</span>(<span class="hljs-number">2000</span>);
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-number">2</span>);
  <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">delay</span>(<span class="hljs-number">2000</span>);
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-number">3</span>);
};

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">main</span> = (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"a"</span>);
  <span class="hljs-title function_">logNumbers</span>();
  <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"b"</span>);
};

<span class="hljs-title function_">main</span>();
</code></pre>
<p>Circling back to <code>forEach</code>, <code>forEach</code> is like <code>main</code> and <code>logFile</code> is like <code>logNumbers</code>. <code>main</code> won't stop just because <code>logNumbers</code> does some <code>await</code>ing, and <code>forEach</code> won't stop just because <code>logFile</code> does some <code>await</code>ing.</p>

<p>Similar to Antonio Val's <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/45006966/8550747"><code>p-iteration</code></a>, an alternative npm module is <a href="https://async-af.js.org/AsyncAF.html#forEachAF" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>async-af</code></a>:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">AsyncAF</span> = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'async-af'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> fs = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'fs-promise'</span>);

<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">printFiles</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
  <span class="hljs-comment">// since AsyncAF accepts promises or non-promises, there's no need to await here</span>
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> files = <span class="hljs-title function_">getFilePaths</span>();

  <span class="hljs-title class_">AsyncAF</span>(files).<span class="hljs-title function_">forEach</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> file =&gt; {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> contents = <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> fs.<span class="hljs-title function_">readFile</span>(file, <span class="hljs-string">'utf8'</span>);
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(contents);
  });
}

<span class="hljs-title function_">printFiles</span>();
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, <a href="https://async-af.js.org/AsyncAF.html#logAF" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>async-af</code></a> has a static method (log/logAF) that logs the results of promises:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">AsyncAF</span> = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'async-af'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> fs = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'fs-promise'</span>);

<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">printFiles</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> files = <span class="hljs-title function_">getFilePaths</span>();

  <span class="hljs-title class_">AsyncAF</span>(files).<span class="hljs-title function_">forEach</span>(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">file</span> =&gt;</span> {
    <span class="hljs-title class_">AsyncAF</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(fs.<span class="hljs-title function_">readFile</span>(file, <span class="hljs-string">'utf8'</span>));
  });
}

<span class="hljs-title function_">printFiles</span>();
</code></pre>

<p>However, the main advantage of the library is that you can chain asynchronous methods to do something like:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> aaf = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'async-af'</span>);
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> fs = <span class="hljs-built_in">require</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'fs-promise'</span>);

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">printFiles</span> = (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) =&gt; <span class="hljs-title function_">aaf</span>(<span class="hljs-title function_">getFilePaths</span>())
  .<span class="hljs-title function_">map</span>(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">file</span> =&gt;</span> fs.<span class="hljs-title function_">readFile</span>(file, <span class="hljs-string">'utf8'</span>))
  .<span class="hljs-title function_">forEach</span>(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">file</span> =&gt;</span> aaf.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(file));

<p>In 2022 I would still advise using external libraries to handle all this async flow.  I've created the module <a href="https://github.com/atmajs/alot" rel="nofollow noreferrer">alot</a> for similar things.</p>
<p>Your example would be:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> fs <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">'fs-promise'</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">printFiles</span> () {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> files = <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">getFilePaths</span>() <span class="hljs-comment">// Assume this works fine</span>

    <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">alot</span>(files)
        .<span class="hljs-title function_">forEachAsync</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> file =&gt; {
            <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> content = <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> fs.<span class="hljs-title function_">readFile</span>(file, <span class="hljs-string">'utf8'</span>);
            <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(content);
        })
        .<span class="hljs-title function_">toArrayAsync</span>({ <span class="hljs-attr">threads</span>: <span class="hljs-number">4</span> });
    }
}
<span class="hljs-title function_">printFiles</span>()
</code></pre>
<p>For simple examples surely the async <code>for..of</code> would do the job, but as soon the task is more complicated you have to use some utility for this.</p>
<p>Alot has dozens of other methods that you can chain, like <code>mapAsync</code>, <code>filterAsync</code>, <code>groupAsync</code>, etc.</p>
<p>As an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load JSON files with products meta</li>
<li>Extract <code>ProductID</code></li>
<li>Load products from the server</li>
<li>Filter those with a price &gt; 100$</li>
<li>Order by price ascending</li>
<li>Take top 50</li>
</ul>
