(I&apos;m surprised other answers have not brought this up yet). Often you only want to access properties that you&apos;ve put onto that object yourself, you don&apos;t want to grab inherited properties.\nHere&apos;s an illustration of this issue. Here we have an innocent-looking program, but it has a subtle bug - can you spot it?\n\n\nconst agesOfUsers = { sam: 16, sally: 22 }\nconst username = prompt(&apos;Enter a username:&apos;)\nif (agesOfUsers[username] !== undefined) {\n  console.log(`${username} is ${agesOfUsers[username]} years old`)\n} else {\n  console.log(`${username} is not found`)\n}\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\nWhen prompted for a username, if you supply &quot;toString&quot; as a username, it&apos;ll give you the following message: &quot;toString is function toString() { [native code] } years old&quot;. The issue is that agesOfUsers is an object, and as such, automatically inherits certain properties like .toString() from the base Object class. You can look here for a full list of properties that all objects inherit.\nSolutions\n\nUse a Map data structure instead. The stored contents of a map don&apos;t suffer from prototype issues, so they provide a clean solution to this problem.\n\n\n\nconst agesOfUsers = new Map()\nagesOfUsers.set(&apos;sam&apos;, 16)\nagesOfUsers.set(&apos;sally&apos;, 2)\nconsole.log(agesOfUsers.get(&apos;sam&apos;)) // 16\n\n  \n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\nUse an object with a null prototype, instead of the default prototype. You can use Object.create(null) to create such an object. This sort of object does not suffer from these prototype issues, because you&apos;ve explicitly created it in a way that it does not inherit anything.\n\n\n\nconst agesOfUsers = Object.create(null)\nagesOfUsers.sam = 16\nagesOfUsers.sally = 22;\nconsole.log(agesOfUsers[&apos;sam&apos;]) // 16\nconsole.log(agesOfUsers[&apos;toString&apos;]) // undefined - toString was not inherited\n\n  \n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\nIf you dealing with an object who&apos;s different possible keys are known in advance (or, it&apos;s at least known to not ever contain keys that conflict with inherited keys, like numeric keys), then you can use Object.hasOwn(yourObj, attrName) instead, to check if the specific dynamic key you&apos;re accessing is in fact an inherited key or not (learn more here). This is a relatively newer feature, so check the compatibility tables before dropping it into your code. Before Object.hasOwn(yourObj, attrName) came around, you would achieve this same effect via Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(yourObj, attrName). Sometimes, you might see code using yourObj.hasOwnProperty(attrName) too, which sometimes works but it has some pitfalls that you can read about here.\n\n\n\n// Try entering the property name &quot;toString&quot;,\n// you&apos;ll see it gets handled correctly.\nconst user = { name: &apos;sam&apos;, age: 16 }\nconst propName = prompt(&apos;Enter a property name:&apos;)\nif (Object.hasOwn(user, propName)) {\n  console.log(`${propName} = ${user[propName]}`)\n} else {\n  console.log(`${propName} is not found`)\n}\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution12","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I asked a question that kinda duplicated on this topic a while back, and after excessive research, and seeing a lot of information missing that should be here, I feel I have something valuable to add to this older post.\n\n\nFirstly I want to address that there are several ways to obtain the value of a property and store it in a dynamic Variable. The first most popular, and easiest way IMHO would be:\n\n\nlet properyValue = element.style[&apos;enter-a-property&apos;];\n\n\nhowever I rarely go this route because it doesn&apos;t work on property values assigned via style-sheets. To give you an example, I&apos;ll demonstrate with a bit of pseudo code.\n\n let elem = document.getElementById(&apos;someDiv&apos;);\n let cssProp = elem.style[&apos;width&apos;];\n\n\n\nUsing the code example above; if the width property of the div element that was stored in the &apos;elem&apos; variable was styled in a CSS style-sheet, and not styled inside of its HTML tag, you are without a doubt going to get a return value of undefined stored inside of the cssProp variable. The undefined value occurs because in-order to get the correct value, the code written inside a CSS Style-Sheet needs to be computed in-order to get the value, therefore; you must use a method that will compute the value of the property who&apos;s value lies within the style-sheet.\n\n\nHenceforth the getComputedStyle() method!\n\n\nfunction getCssProp(){\n  let ele = document.getElementById(&quot;test&quot;);\n  let cssProp = window.getComputedStyle(ele,null).getPropertyValue(&quot;width&quot;);\n}\n\n\n\nW3Schools getComputedValue Doc This gives a good example, and lets you play with it, however, this link Mozilla CSS getComputedValue doc talks about the getComputedValue function in detail, and should be read by any aspiring developer who isn&apos;t totally clear on this subject.\n\n\nAs a side note, the getComputedValue method only gets, it does not set. This, obviously is a major downside, however there is a method that gets from CSS style-sheets, as well as sets values, though it is not standard Javascript.\nThe JQuery method... \n\n\n$(selector).css(property,value)\n\n\n...does get, and does set. It is what I use, the only downside is you got to know JQuery, but this is honestly one of the very many good reasons that every Javascript Developer should learn JQuery, it just makes life easy, and offers methods, like this one, which is not available with standard Javascript.\nHope this helps someone!!!\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution13","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"For

<p>You can achieve this in quite a few different ways.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> foo = {
    <span class="hljs-attr">bar</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'Hello World'</span>
};

foo.<span class="hljs-property">bar</span>;
foo[<span class="hljs-string">'bar'</span>];
</code></pre>

<p>The bracket notation is specially powerful as it let's you access a property based on a variable:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> foo = {
    <span class="hljs-attr">bar</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'Hello World'</span>
};

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> prop = <span class="hljs-string">'bar'</span>;

foo[prop];
</code></pre>

<p>This can be extended to looping over every property of an object. This can be seem redundant due to newer JavaScript constructs such as for ... of ..., but helps illustrate a use case:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> foo = {
    <span class="hljs-attr">bar</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'Hello World'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attr">baz</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'How are you doing?'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attr">last</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'Quite alright'</span>
};

<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> prop <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> foo.<span class="hljs-title function_">getOwnPropertyNames</span>()) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(foo[prop]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Both dot and bracket notation also work as expected for nested objects:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> foo = {
    <span class="hljs-attr">bar</span>: {
        <span class="hljs-attr">baz</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'Hello World'</span>
    }
};

foo.<span class="hljs-property">bar</span>.<span class="hljs-property">baz</span>;
foo[<span class="hljs-string">'bar'</span>][<span class="hljs-string">'baz'</span>];
foo.<span class="hljs-property">bar</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'baz'</span>];
foo[<span class="hljs-string">'bar'</span>].<span class="hljs-property">baz</span>;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Object destructuring</strong></p>

<p>We could also consider object destructuring as a means to access a property in an object, but as follows:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> foo = {
    <span class="hljs-attr">bar</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'Hello World'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attr">baz</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'How are you doing?'</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attr">last</span>: <span class="hljs-string">'Quite alright'</span>
};

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> prop = <span class="hljs-string">'last'</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> { bar, baz, [prop]: customName } = foo;

<span class="hljs-comment">// bar = 'Hello World'</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// baz = 'How are you doing?'</span>

<h2>UPDATED</h2>
<p>Accessing root properties in an object is easily achieved with <code>obj[variable]</code>, but getting nested complicates things. Not to write already written code I suggest to use <code>lodash.get</code>.</p>

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> listOfNestedProperties = [var1, var2];

<p>I came across a case where <em>I thought</em> I wanted to pass the "address" of an object property as data to another function and populate the object (with AJAX), do lookup from address array, and display in that other function. I couldn't use dot notation without doing string acrobatics so I thought an array might be nice to pass instead. I ended-up doing something different anyway, but seemed related to this post.</p>

<p>Here's a sample of a language file object like the one I wanted data from:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> locs = {
  <span class="hljs-string">"audioPlayer"</span>: {
    <span class="hljs-string">"controls"</span>: {
      <span class="hljs-string">"start"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"start"</span>,
      <span class="hljs-string">"stop"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"stop"</span>
    },
    <span class="hljs-string">"heading"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"Use controls to start and stop audio."</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I wanted to be able to pass an array such as: ["audioPlayer", "controls", "stop"] to access the language text, "stop" in this case.</p>

<p>I created this little function that looks-up the "least specific" (first) address parameter, and reassigns the returned object to itself. Then it is ready to look-up the next-most-specific address parameter if one exists.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">getText</span>(<span class="hljs-params">selectionArray, obj</span>) {
  selectionArray.<span class="hljs-title function_">forEach</span>(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">key</span> =&gt;</span> {
    obj = obj[key];
  });
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> obj;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>ES5 // Check Deeply Nested Variables</h2>

<p>This simple piece of code can check for deeply nested variable / value existence without having to check each variable along the way... </p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> getValue = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"> s, context </span>){

}

<p>Ex. - a deeply nested array of objects:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">a = [ 
    {
      b : [

<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>There's a major gotchya in that solution! (I'm surprised other answers have not brought this up yet). Often you only want to access properties that you've put onto that object yourself, you don't want to grab inherited properties.</p>
<p>Here's an illustration of this issue. Here we have an innocent-looking program, but it has a subtle bug - can you spot it?</p>
<p></p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">

</div>
<p></p>
<p>When prompted for a username, if you supply "toString" as a username, it'll give you the following message: "toString is function toString() { [native code] } years old". The issue is that <code>agesOfUsers</code> is an object, and as such, automatically inherits certain properties like <code>.toString()</code> from the base Object class. You can look <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> for a full list of properties that all objects inherit.</p>

<li>If you dealing with an object who's different possible keys are known in advance (or, it's at least known to not ever contain keys that conflict with inherited keys, like numeric keys), then you can use <code>Object.hasOwn(yourObj, attrName)</code> instead, to check if the specific dynamic key you're accessing is in fact an inherited key or not (learn more <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwn" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a>). This is a relatively newer feature, so check the compatibility tables before dropping it into your code. Before <code>Object.hasOwn(yourObj, attrName)</code> came around, you would achieve this same effect via <code>Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(yourObj, attrName)</code>.

<p>I asked a question that kinda duplicated on this topic a while back, and after excessive research, and seeing a lot of information missing that should be here, I feel I have something valuable to add to this older post.</p>

<ul>
<li>Firstly I want to address that there are several ways to obtain the value of a property and store it in a dynamic Variable. The first most popular, and easiest way IMHO would be:</li>
</ul>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> properyValue = element.<span class="hljs-property">style</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'enter-a-property'</span>];
</code></pre>

<p>however I rarely go this route because it doesn't work on property values assigned via style-sheets. To give you an example, I'll demonstrate with a bit of pseudo code.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"> <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> elem = <span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">getElementById</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'someDiv'</span>);
 <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> cssProp = elem.<span class="hljs-property">style</span>[<span class="hljs-string">'width'</span>];

</code></pre>

<p>Using the code example above; if the width property of the div element that was stored in the 'elem' variable was styled in a CSS style-sheet, and not styled inside of its HTML tag, you are without a doubt going to get a return value of undefined stored inside of the cssProp variable. The undefined value occurs because in-order to get the correct value, the code written inside a CSS Style-Sheet needs to be computed in-order to get the value, therefore; you must use a method that will compute the value of the property who's value lies within the style-sheet.</p>

<ul>
<li>Henceforth the getComputedStyle() method!</li>
</ul>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">getCssProp</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> ele = <span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">getElementById</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"test"</span>);
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> cssProp = <span class="hljs-variable language_">window</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">getComputedStyle</span>(ele,<span class="hljs-literal">null</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">getPropertyValue</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"width"</span>);
}

</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_getcomputedstyle.asp" rel="nofollow noreferrer">W3Schools getComputedValue Doc</a> This gives a good example, and lets you play with it, however, this link <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/computed_value" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Mozilla CSS getComputedValue doc</a> talks about the getComputedValue function in detail, and should be read by any aspiring developer who isn't totally clear on this subject.</p>

<ul>
<li>As a side note, the getComputedValue method only gets, it does not set. This, obviously is a major downside, however there is a method that gets from CSS style-sheets, as well as sets values, though it is not standard Javascript.
The JQuery method... </li>
</ul>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$(selector).<span class="hljs-title function_">css</span>(property,value)
</code></pre>

<p>...does get, and does set. It is what I use, the only downside is you got to know JQuery, but this is honestly one of the very many good reasons that every Javascript Developer should learn JQuery, it just makes life easy, and offers methods, like this one, which is not available with standard Javascript.
Hope this helps someone!!!</p>
