This may sound silly, but you never know. An easy way to check is to run php -v from a command line and see if returns version information or any errors.\nMake sure that the PHP module is listed and uncommented inside of your Apache&apos;s httpd.conf This should be something like LoadModule php5_module &quot;c:/php/php5apache2_2.dll&quot; in the file. Search for LoadModule php, and make sure that there is no comment (;) in front of it.\nMake sure that Apache&apos;s httpd.conf file has the PHP MIME type in it. This should be something like AddType application/x-httpd-php .php. This tells Apache to run .php files as PHP. Search for AddType, and then make sure there is an entry for PHP, and that it is uncommented.\nMake sure your file has the .php extension on it, or whichever extension specified in the MIME definition in point #3, otherwise it will not be executed as PHP.\nMake sure you are not using short tags in the PHP file (&lt;?), these are  not enabled on all servers by default and their use is discouraged. Use &lt;?php instead (or enable short tags in your php.ini with short_open_tag=On if you have code that relies on them). \nMake sure you are accessing your file over your webserver using an URL like http://localhost/file.php not via local file access file://localhost/www/file.php\n\n\nAnd lastly check the PHP manual for further setup tips.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"php7 : \n\nsudo a2enmod proxy_fcgi setenvif\nsudo a2enconf php7.0-fpm\nsudo service apache2 restart\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I&apos;m running Apache on Ubuntu and my issue was that the /etc/apache2/mods-available/php5.conf file was missing this:\n\n&lt;FilesMatch &quot;.+\\.ph(p[345]?|t|tml)$&quot;&gt;\n    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php\n&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;\n\n\nI added it back in and php was parsing php files correctly.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"note for php 7 users, add this to your httpd.conf file:\n\n# PHP 7 specific configuration\n&lt;IfModule php7_module&gt;\n    AddType application/x-httpd-php .php\n    AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps\n    &lt;IfModule dir_module&gt;\n        DirectoryIndex index.html index.php\n    &lt;/IfModule&gt;\n&lt;/IfModule&gt;\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I found another problem causing this issue and already solved it.

<p>Sounds like there is something wrong with your configuration, here are a few things you can check:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Make sure that PHP is installed and running correctly. This may sound silly, but you never know. An easy way to check is to run <code>php -v</code> from a command line and see if returns version information or any errors.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that the PHP module is listed <strong>and uncommented</strong> inside of your Apache's httpd.conf This should be something like <code>LoadModule php5_module "c:/php/php5apache2_2.dll"</code> in the file. Search for <code>LoadModule php</code>, and make sure that there is no comment (<code>;</code>) in front of it.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that Apache's httpd.conf file has the PHP MIME type in it. This should be something like <code>AddType application/x-httpd-php .php</code>. This tells Apache to run <code>.php</code> files as PHP. Search for AddType, and then make sure there is an entry for PHP, <strong>and that it is uncommented</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure your file has the <code>.php</code> extension on it, or whichever extension specified in the MIME definition in point #3, otherwise it will not be executed as PHP.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you are not using <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.phptags.php" rel="noreferrer">short tags</a> in the PHP file (<code>&lt;?</code>), these are  <em>not enabled on all servers</em> by default and their use is discouraged. Use <code>&lt;?php</code> instead (or <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.short-open-tag" rel="noreferrer">enable short tags in your php.ini</a> with <code>short_open_tag=On</code> if you have code that relies on them). </p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you are accessing your file over your webserver using an URL like <code>http://localhost/file.php</code> not via local file access <code>file://localhost/www/file.php</code></p></li>
</ol>

<p>And lastly check the <a href="http://php.net/install" rel="noreferrer">PHP manual for further setup tips</a>.</p>

<p>You're just opening your php file into browser. You have to open it using localhost url. if you open a file directly from your directory it will not execute the php code in any case.</p>

<p><strong>use: <code>http://locahost/index.php</code> or <code>http:127.0.0.1/index.php</code></strong></p>

<p>Enable php short code. In your case, you are using <code>&lt;?</code> which is php short code for <code>&lt;?php</code>. By default php short codes are disabled.</p>

<p><em>I'm posting this answer because my Virtualmin/Webmin admin interface decided it was a good idea to disable my PHP engine.. took me a while to find the solution, so I thought I'd share it with you guys:</em></p>

<p>Also, be sure to check that none of your website config files related to this specific host or virtualhost have any php_admin_value's in them that turn off PHP, like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">php_admin_value engine Off

<p>This just happened to me again, along with the server downloading html files, rather than processing. I had not use the webserver apache for some time on the computer and meanwhile Ubuntu updated like two more versions from originally installed LTS. Now it is </p>

Ubuntu <span class="hljs-number">16.04</span> LTS

<p>In case we are in the same page do following</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install php -y</code>
<code>sudo apt-get install php-{bcmath,bz2,intl,gd,mbstring,mysql,zip,fpm} -y</code></p>

<p>To enable PHP 7.2 FPM in Apache2 do:</p>

<p><code>a2enmod proxy_fcgi setenvif</code></p>

<p><code>a2enconf php7.2-fpm</code></p>

<h2>update 2: Apache downloads .php file instead of rendering</h2>

<p>After that, I faced above issue. There are similar questions like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18422140/apache-is-downloading-php-files-instead-of-displaying-them">this</a>.</p>

<p>I don't know why but it only happened for my .php files in <code>/var/www/html/</code> root folder. everything was ok for sub-directories. (for example wordpress and phpmyadmin worked fine)</p>

<p>So here is my solution. I decided to enable php module. so I ran this command:</p>

<p><code>a2enmod php7.2</code></p>

<p>but I got this errors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Considering dependency mpm_prefork for php7.2:
  Considering conflict mpm_event for mpm_prefork:
  ERROR: Module mpm_event is enabled - cannot proceed due to conflicts. It needs to be disabled first!
  Considering conflict mpm_worker for mpm_prefork:
  ERROR: Could not enable dependency mpm_prefork for php7.2, aborting</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so I decided to disable mpm by running following commands:</p>

<pre class="lang-sh s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-bash">sudo a2dismod mpm_prefork
sudo a2dismod mpm_worker
sudo a2dismod mpm_event
</code></pre>

<p>then restart apache:</p>

<p><code>systemctl restart apache2</code></p>

<p>then enable php7.2 (my installed version):</p>

<p>on my ubuntu 14.04, apache 2.4, php 5.5.9 install,  I tried with a sample.php on /var/www/html (default document root) and it worked ok. 
So the problem was on my Virtual Servers config.
The solution was to include, on the Directory def containing the .php, this line:</p>

<p>Another possible cause of this problem could be that you are trying to run the script in a "user directory" from the <code>UserDir</code> module.

You will run into this problem if the script is in the <code>public_html</code> directory in your home folder and you are trying to access it from <code>http://localhost/~your_username</code>.</p>
<p>To fix this, open up <code>/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php7.2.conf</code>.  You must comment or delete the tag block at the bottom that reads</p>

<p>index.html contained PHP code.  By default, PHP won't process files with extentions like htm* as PHP code.</p>

<p>You can override this, by adding the following to .htaccess:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">&lt;FilesMatch <span class="hljs-string">".+\.html$"</span>&gt;

<p>Just spent hours of trying to get <strong>PHP 5 to run with Apache 2.4 on Windows 10</strong>. Finally for me it was a typo in <em>httpd.conf</em> <code>LoadModule</code>. Drew attention to writing and exact module path through the <a href="https://www.apachelounge.com/viewtopic.php?p=36861" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong>last answer</strong> in this apachelounge thread of <strong>denny2018</strong></a>. Thank you!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After two nights I discovered... My directory was written <code>c:</code> (lower case)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I had <code>LoadModule php5_module "c:/php/php5apache2.dll"</code> but <strong>correct for apache 2.4</strong> is:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">LoadModule php5_module <span class="hljs-string">"C:/php/php5apache2_4.dll"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>So I also missed the <code>_4</code> before (for <em>apache 2.4</em>). The full snippet that worked for me:</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php"><span class="hljs-comment"># PHP</span>
LoadModule php5_module <span class="hljs-string">"C:/php/php5apache2_4.dll"</span>
AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .php
&lt;FilesMatch \.php$&gt;
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
&lt;/FilesMatch&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Just tried <strong>PHP 7</strong>. There the <code>LoadModule</code> line in <em>httpd.conf</em> for Apache 2.4 reads</p>

<pre class="lang-php s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-php">LoadModule php7_module <span class="hljs-string">"C:/php/php7apache2_4.dll"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Currently <a href="http://php.net/manual/fa/install.windows.apache2.php#installing" rel="nofollow noreferrer">php manual shows up</a> <code>c:/php/php5apache2.dll</code> which of course needs to be adjusted.</p>
