Some valid nesting selectors, like .foo &amp;, are disallowed, and editing the selector in certain ways can make the rule invalid unexpectedly. As well, some people find the nesting challenging to distinguish visually from the surrounding declarations.\nTo aid in all these issues, this specification defines the @nest rule, which imposes fewer restrictions on how to validly nest style rules. Its syntax is:\n@nest = @nest &lt;selector&gt; { &lt;declaration-list&gt; }\nThe @nest rule functions identically to a style rule: it starts with a selector, and contains declarations that apply to the elements the selector matches.

But multiple labels can all point to the same input, though that would make both the HTML and CSS look even grosser.\n\n\n... I&apos;m hoping that there is some sort of workaround that exists native to CSS Level 2...\n\nI am not sure about the other pseudo classes, but I :checked for pre-CSS 3. If I remember correctly, it was something like [checked] which is why you may find it in the above code, for example,\n.menu__checkbox__selection:checked ~ .menu__hidden,\n.menu__checkbox__selection[checked] ~ .menu__hidden {\n /* rules: and-stuff; */\n}\n\n... but for things like ::after and :hover, I&apos;m not at all certain in which CSS version those first appeared.\nThat all stated, please don&apos;t ever use this in production, not even in anger.

<p>There is currently no way to select the parent of an element in CSS, at least not a way that works across all browsers.</p>
<p>If there was a way to do it, it would be in either of the current CSS selectors specs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#selectors" rel="noreferrer">Selectors Level 3 Spec</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#pattern-matching" rel="noreferrer">CSS 2.1 Selectors Spec</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That said, the <a href="https://dev.w3.org/csswg/selectors4/#relational" rel="noreferrer">Selectors Level 4 Working Draft</a> includes a <code>:has()</code> pseudo-class that will provide this capability. It will be similar to the <a href="https://api.jquery.com/has-selector/" rel="noreferrer">jQuery implementation</a>.</p>
<pre class="lang-css s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">li</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:has</span>(&gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag">a</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.active</span>) { <span class="hljs-comment">/* styles to apply to the li tag */</span> }
</code></pre>
<p>However, as of 2022, <strong><a href="https://caniuse.com/css-has" rel="noreferrer">it is only supported by Safari</a></strong>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you'll have to resort to JavaScript if you need to select a parent element.</p>

<p>I dont think you can select the parent in CSS only.</p>

<p>But as you already seem to have an <code>.active</code> class, it would be easier to move that class to the <code>li</code> (instead of the <code>a</code>). That way you can access both the <code>li</code> and the <code>a</code> via CSS only.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://github.com/Idered/cssParentSelector" rel="noreferrer">this script</a>:</p>

<pre class="lang-css s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css">*! &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag">input</span><span class="hljs-selector-attr">[type=text]</span> { <span class="hljs-attribute">background</span>: <span class="hljs-number">#000</span>; }

<p>This will select any parent of a text input. But wait, there's still much more. If you want, you can select a specified parent:</p>

<pre class="lang-css s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.input-wrap</span>! &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag">input</span><span class="hljs-selector-attr">[type=text]</span> { <span class="hljs-attribute">background</span>: <span class="hljs-number">#000</span>; }

<p>Or select it when it's active:</p>

<pre class="lang-css s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.input-wrap</span>! &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag">input</span><span class="hljs-selector-attr">[type=text]</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:focus</span> { <span class="hljs-attribute">background</span>: <span class="hljs-number">#000</span>; }

<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>

<p>You can select that <code>span.help</code> when the <code>input</code> is active and show it:</p>

<pre class="lang-css s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.input-wrap</span>! <span class="hljs-selector-class">.help</span> &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag">input</span><span class="hljs-selector-attr">[type=text]</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:focus</span> { <span class="hljs-attribute">display</span>: block; }

<p>There are many more capabilities; just check out the documentation of the plugin.</p>

<p>There is no parent selector; just the way there is no previous sibling selector. One good reason for not having these selectors is because the browser has to traverse through all children of an element to determine whether or not a class should be applied. For example, if you wrote:</p>

<pre class="lang-css s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">body</span>:<span class="hljs-built_in">contains-selector</span>(a.active) { <span class="hljs-attribute">background</span>: red; }
</code></pre>

<p>Then the browser will have to wait until it has loaded and parsed everything until the <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> to determine if the page should be red or not.</p>

<p>The article <em><a href="http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/css-parent-selectors" rel="noreferrer">Why we don't have a parent selector</a></em> explains it in detail.</p>

<p>I know the OP was looking for a CSS solution but it is simple to achieve using jQuery. In my case I needed to find the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> parent tag for a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tag contained in the child <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>. jQuery has the <code>:has</code> selector so it's possible to identify a parent by the children it contains:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$(<span class="hljs-string">"ul:has(#someId)"</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>will select the <code>ul</code> element that has a child element with id <em>someId</em>. Or to answer the original question, something like the following should do the trick (untested):</p>

<p>This is the most discussed aspect of the <strong>Selectors Level 4</strong> specification.
With this, a selector will be able to style an element according to its child by using an exclamation mark after the given selector (!).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre class="lang-css s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">body</span>! <span class="hljs-selector-tag">a</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:hover</span>{

<p>You might try to use hyperlink as the parent, and then change the inner elements on hover. Like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-css s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">a</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.active</span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag">h1</span> {<span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>:red;}

<p>This way you can change the style in multiple inner tags, based on the rollover of the parent element.</p>

<p>There's a plugin that extends CSS to include some non-standard features that can really help when designing websites. It's called <a href="http://elementqueries.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">EQCSS</a>.</p>

<p>One of the things EQCSS adds is a parent selector. It works in all browsers, Internet&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;8 and up. Here's the format:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-less"><span class="hljs-variable">@element</span> <span class="hljs-string">'a.active'</span> {
  $<span class="hljs-selector-tag">parent</span> {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">background</span>: red;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So here we've opened an element query on every element <code>a.active</code>, and for the styles inside that query, things like <code>$parent</code> make sense, because there's a reference point. The browser can find the parent, because it's very similar to <code>parentNode</code> in JavaScript.</p>

<p><a href="http://elementqueries.com/demos/parent.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here's a demo of <code>$parent</code></a> and <a href="http://staticresource.com/parent.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">another <code>$parent</code> demo that works in Internet&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;8</a>, as well as <a href="https://i.imgur.com/QyVAj2u.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer">a screenshot in case you don't have Internet&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;8 around to test with</a>.</p>

<p>EQCSS also includes <a href="http://elementqueries.com/#meta-selectors" rel="nofollow noreferrer">meta-selectors</a>: <code>$prev</code> for the element before a selected element and <code>$this</code> for only those elements that match an element query, and more.</p>

<p>It's now 2019, and the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-nesting-1/" rel="noreferrer">latest draft of the CSS Nesting Module</a> actually has something like this. Introducing <code>@nest</code> at-rules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3.2. The Nesting At-Rule: @nest</p>
<p>While direct nesting looks nice, it is somewhat fragile. Some valid nesting selectors, like .foo &amp;, are disallowed, and editing the selector in certain ways can make the rule invalid unexpectedly. As well, some people find the nesting challenging to distinguish visually from the surrounding declarations.</p>
<p>To aid in all these issues, this specification defines the @nest rule, which imposes fewer restrictions on how to validly nest style rules. Its syntax is:</p>
<p><code>@nest = @nest &lt;selector&gt; { &lt;declaration-list&gt; }</code></p>
<p>The @nest rule functions identically to a style rule: it starts with a selector, and contains declarations that apply to the elements the selector matches. The only difference is that the selector used in a @nest rule must be nest-containing, which means it contains a nesting selector in it somewhere. A list of selectors is nest-containing if all of its individual complex selectors are nest-containing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Copy and pasted from the URL above).</p>
<p>Example of valid selectors under this specification:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-less"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.foo</span> {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>: red;
  <span class="hljs-variable">@nest</span> &amp; &gt; .bar {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>: blue;
  }
}
<span class="hljs-comment">/* Equivalent to:
   .foo { color: red; }
   .foo &gt; .bar { color: blue; }
 */</span>

<span class="hljs-selector-class">.foo</span> {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>: red;
  <span class="hljs-variable">@nest</span> .parent &amp; {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>: blue;
  }
}
<span class="hljs-comment">/* Equivalent to:
   .foo { color: red; }
   .parent .foo { color: blue; }

<p>Technically there is no direct way to do this. However, you can sort that out with either jQuery or JavaScript.</p>

<p>However, you can do something like this as well.</p>

<span class="hljs-selector-tag">a</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.active</span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag">p</span> {<span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>: green;}

<p><strong>jQuery</strong></p>

<p>The short answer is <strong>NO</strong>; we don't have a <code>parent selector</code> at this stage in CSS, but if you don't have to swap the elements or classes anyway, the second option is using JavaScript. Something like this:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> activeATag = <span class="hljs-title class_">Array</span>.<span class="hljs-property"><span class="hljs-keyword">prototype</span></span>.<span class="hljs-property">slice</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">call</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">document</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">querySelectorAll</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'a.active'</span>));

activeATag.<span class="hljs-title function_">map</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">x</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(x.<span class="hljs-property">parentNode</span>.<span class="hljs-property">tagName</span> === <span class="hljs-string">'LI'</span>) {
    x.<span class="hljs-property">parentNode</span>.<span class="hljs-property">style</span>.<span class="hljs-property">color</span> = <span class="hljs-string">'red'</span>; <span class="hljs-comment">// Your property: value;</span>
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Or a shorter way if you use <strong>jQuery</strong> in your application:</p>

<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">$(<span class="hljs-string">'a.active'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">parents</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'li'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">css</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'color'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'red'</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// Your property: value;</span>

<p>Although there is no parent selector in standard CSS at present, I am working on a (personal) project called <strong>axe</strong> (ie. <em>Augmented CSS Selector Syntax / ACSSSS</em>) which, among its 7 new selectors, includes both:</p>
<ol>
<li>an <em>immediate parent</em> selector <code>&lt;</code> (which enables the opposite selection to <code>&gt;</code>)</li>
<li>an <em>any ancestor selector</em> <code>^</code> (which enables the opposite selection to <code>[SPACE]</code>)</li>
</ol>

<p>In the example above <code>&lt;</code> is the <strong>immediate parent selector</strong>, so</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.child.using-axe &lt; .parent</code></li>
</ul>
<p>means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>any immediate parent of <code>.child.using-axe</code> which is <code>.parent</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could alternatively use:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.child.using-axe &lt; div</code></li>
</ul>
<p>which would mean:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>any immediate parent of <code>.child.using-axe</code> which is a <code>div</code></p>

<p>The CSS parent selector (also know as the <strong>:has() selector</strong>) has finally landed in Safari TP 137. The feature is currently being implementated in Chrome as well. (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/:has" rel="nofollow noreferrer">MDN Documentation</a>)</p>
<p>Parent selection is done via the pseudo-class <code>:has()</code>.  For example, <code>div:has(&gt; .child)</code> will select all <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements with a child having a <code>child</code> class.</p>
<p>Other examples:</p>
<p><strong>Selecting direct parent of an element </strong></p><p></p>

<p>The following selector will select both <code>grandparent</code> and <code>parent</code></p>
<pre class="lang-css s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">div</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:has</span>(<span class="hljs-selector-class">.child</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use it for nested selectors and even with other pseudo classes:</p>
<pre class="lang-css s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">div</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:has</span>(&gt; <span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:nth-child</span>(<span class="hljs-number">10</span>))
</code></pre>
<p>Other valid CSS operators can be used to customize the query.</p>

<p>Changing parent element based on child element can currently only happen when we have an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element inside the parent element. When an input gets focus, its corresponding parent element can get affected using CSS.</p>

<p>No, you cannot select the parent in CSS only.</p>

<p>But as you already seem to have an <code>.active</code> class, it would be easier to move that class to the <code>li</code> (instead of the <code>a</code>). That way you can access both the <code>li</code> and the <code>a</code> via CSS only.</p>

<p>CSS4 will be fancy if it adds some <em>hooks</em> into <em>walking backwards</em>. Until then it is possible (though <strong>not</strong> advisable) to use <code>checkbox</code> and/or <code>radio</code> <em><code>input</code>s</em> to <em>break</em> the usual way that things are connected, and through that also allow CSS to operate outside of its normal scope...</p>

  This bit works, but will one day cause troubles,
  but truth is you can stick checkbox/radio inputs
  just about anywhere and then call them by id with
  a `for` label. Keep scrolling to see what I mean

<p>... pretty <em>gross</em>, but with just CSS and HTML it is possible to touch and re-touch anything but the <code>body</code> and <code>:root</code> from just about anywhere by linking the <code>id</code> and <code>for</code> properties of <code>radio</code>/<code>checkbox</code> <em><code>input</code>s</em> and <code>label</code> <em>triggers</em>; likely someone'll show how to re-touch those at some point.</p>
<p>One additional caveat is that only <strong>one</strong> <code>input</code> of a specific <code>id</code> maybe used, first <code>checkbox</code>/<code>radio</code> <em>wins</em> a toggled state in other words... <strong>But</strong> multiple labels can all point to the same <code>input</code>, though that would make both the HTML and CSS look even grosser.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>... I'm hoping that there is some sort of workaround that exists native to CSS Level 2...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not sure about the other pseudo classes, but I <code>:checked</code> for pre-CSS&nbsp;3. If I remember correctly, it was something like <code>[checked]</code> which is why you may find it in the above code, for example,</p>
<pre class="lang-css s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.menu__checkbox__selection</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:checked</span> ~ <span class="hljs-selector-class">.menu__hidden</span>,

 <span class="hljs-comment">/* rules: and-stuff; */</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>... but for things like <code>::after</code> and <code>:hover</code>, I'm not at all certain in which CSS version those first appeared.</p>
<p>That all stated, please don't ever use this in production, not even in anger. As a joke sure, or in other words just because something <em>can</em> be done does not always mean it <em>should</em>.</p>

<p>Try this...</p>
<p><strong>This solution uses plain CSS2 rules with no Javascript and works in all browsers, old and new</strong>. When clicked, the child <code>anchor</code> tag activates its <code>active</code> pseudo-class event. It then simply hides itself, allowing the <code>active</code> event to bubble up to the parent <code>li</code> tag who then restyles himself and reveals his anchor child again with a new style. The child has styled the parent.</p>
<p>Using your example:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">ul</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">li</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"listitem"</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">a</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"link"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">href</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"#"</span>&gt;</span>This is a Link<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">a</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">ul</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Now apply these styles with the <code>active</code> pseudo-class on <code>a</code> to restyle the parent <code>li</code> tag when the link is clicked:</p>
<pre class="default s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">a</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.link</span> {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">display</span>: inline-block;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>: white;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">background-color</span>: green;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">text-decoration</span>: none;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">padding</span>: <span class="hljs-number">5px</span>;
}

<span class="hljs-selector-tag">li</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.listitem</span> {

    <span class="hljs-attribute">padding</span>: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
    <span class="hljs-attribute">background-color</span>: transparent;
}

<span class="hljs-comment">/* When this 'active' pseudo-class event below fires on click, it hides itself,
triggering the active event again on its parent which applies new styles to itself and its child. */</span>

<span class="hljs-selector-tag">a</span><span class="hljs-selector-class">.link</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:active</span> {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">display</span>: none;
}

The Nesting At-Rule: @nest\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;While direct nesting looks nice, it is somewhat fragile. Some valid nesting selectors, like .foo \u0026amp;amp;, are disallowed, and editing the selector in certain ways can make the rule invalid unexpectedly. As well, some people find the nesting challenging to distinguish visually from the surrounding declarations.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;To aid in all these issues, this specification defines the @nest rule, which imposes fewer restrictions on how to validly nest style rules. Its syntax is:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;@nest = @nest \u0026amp;lt;selector\u0026amp;gt; { \u0026amp;lt;declaration-list\u0026amp;gt; }\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The @nest rule functions identically to a style rule: it starts with a selector, and contains declarations that apply to the elements the selector matches. The only difference is that the selector used in a @nest rule must be nest-containing, which means it contains a nesting selector in it somewhere. A list of selectors is nest-containing if all of its individual complex selectors are nest-containing.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;(Copy and pasted from the URL above).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Example of valid selectors under this specification:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;default s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-less\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-selector-class\u0026quot;\u0026gt;.foo\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {\n  \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-attribute\u0026quot;\u0026gt;color\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;: red;\n  \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-variable\u0026quot;\u0026gt;@nest\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026amp;amp; \u0026amp;gt; .bar {\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-attribute\u0026quot;\u0026gt;color\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;: blue;\n  }\n}\n\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-comment\u0026quot;\u0026gt;/* Equivalent to:\n   .foo { color: red; }\n   .foo \u0026amp;gt; .bar { color: blue; }\n */\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-selector-class\u0026quot;\u0026gt;.foo\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {\n  \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-attribute\u0026quot;\u0026gt;color\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;: red;\n  \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-variable\u0026quot;\u0026gt;@nest\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; .parent \u0026amp;amp; {\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-attribute\u0026quot;\u0026gt;color\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;: blue;\n  }\n}\n\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-comment\u0026quot;\u0026gt;/* Equivalent to:\n   .foo { color: red; }\n   .parent .foo { color: blue; }\n */\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-selector-class\u0026quot;\u0026gt;.foo\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {\n  \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-attribute\u0026quot;\u0026gt;color\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;: red;\n  \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-variable\u0026quot;\u0026gt;@nest :\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;not(\u0026amp;amp;) {\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-attribute\u0026quot;\u0026gt;color\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;: blue;\n  }\n}\n\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-comment\u0026quot;\u0026gt;/* Equivalent to:\n   .foo { color: red; }\n   :not(.foo) { color: blue; }\n */\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The W3C excluded such a selector because of the huge performance impact it would have on a browser.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Technically there is no direct way to do this.
