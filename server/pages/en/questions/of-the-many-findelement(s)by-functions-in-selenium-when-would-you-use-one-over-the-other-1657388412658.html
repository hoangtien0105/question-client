.find_element_by_

id
link_text
partial_link_text
name
class_name
tag_name
css_selector
xpath


It&#x27;s apparent that some are limited by design due to how the HTML page was created, such as id, link_text, name, tag_name, as not all tags may contain an id, link_text, etc... However, the css_selector and xpath can do pretty much everything these can do, and then some, but seem to be limited on what they can interact with. For example, some buttons might not be able to get clicked with the xpath, but can get clicked by css_selector. 

So i&#x27;m wondering, when would one want to use one over the other(specifically xpath or css_selector)? 

Are the other functions(id, link_text, etc), pretty much not useful, since (at least) I find that xpath/css_selector can do it as well? 

Are there any benefits to using, lets say, link_text, over xpath/css_selector?

However, the css_selector and xpath can do pretty much everything these can do, and then some, but seem to be limited on what they can interact with. For example, some buttons might not be able to get clicked with the xpath, but can get clicked by css_selector. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So i\u0026apos;m wondering, when would one want to use one over the other(specifically xpath or css_selector)? \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Are the other functions(id, link_text, etc), pretty much not useful, since (at least) I find that xpath/css_selector can do it as well? \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Are there any benefits to using, lets say, link_text, over xpath/css_selector?  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","slug":"of-the-many-findelement(s)by-functions-in-selenium-when-would-you-use-one-over-the-other-1657388412658","postType":"QUESTION","createdAt":"2022-07-09T17:40:12.000Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-09T17:40:12.000Z","tags":[],"relatedQuestions":[]},"randomQuestions":[{"title":"How to read a file line-by-line into a list?","slug":"how-to-read-a-file-line-by-line-into-a-list-1657387865894"},{"title":"mysqli or die, does it have to die?","slug":"mysqli-or-die-does-it-have-to-die-1657388533922"},{"title":"How do I install pip on Windows?","slug":"how-do-i-install-pip-on-windows-1657388147761"},{"title":"Where and why do I have to put the \"template\" and \"typename\" keywords?","slug":"where-and-why-do-i-have-to-put-the-\"template\"-and-\"typename\"-keywords-1657384467606"},{"title":"What is the (function() { } )() construct in JavaScript?","slug":"what-is-the-(function()-)()-construct-in-javascript-1657385508348"},{"title":"Is List\u003cDog\u003e a subclass of List\u003cAnimal\u003e?
