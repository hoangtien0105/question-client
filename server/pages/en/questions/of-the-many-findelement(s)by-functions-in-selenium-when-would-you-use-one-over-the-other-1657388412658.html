.find_element_by_

id
link_text
partial_link_text
name
class_name
tag_name
css_selector
xpath


It&#x27;s apparent that some are limited by design due to how the HTML page was created, such as id, link_text, name, tag_name, as not all tags may contain an id, link_text, etc... However, the css_selector and xpath can do pretty much everything these can do, and then some, but seem to be limited on what they can interact with. For example, some buttons might not be able to get clicked with the xpath, but can get clicked by css_selector. 

So i&#x27;m wondering, when would one want to use one over the other(specifically xpath or css_selector)? 

Are the other functions(id, link_text, etc), pretty much not useful, since (at least) I find that xpath/css_selector can do it as well? 

Are there any benefits to using, lets say, link_text, over xpath/css_selector?

<p>This question have been asked and answered in numerous forums in different formats. Considering them all if we prioritize the locators the list would be as follows :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>id</strong>: Select element with the specified <code>id</code> attribute.</li>
<li><strong>name</strong>: Select first element with the specified <code>name</code> attribute.</li>
<li><strong>link_text</strong>: Select link (anchor tag) element which contains <em>text</em> matching the specified <code>LinkText</code>.</li>
<li><strong>partial_link_text</strong>: Select link (anchor tag) element which contains <em>text</em> matching the specified <code>PartialLinkText</code>.</li>
<li><strong>tag_name</strong>: Locate Element using a <code>Tag Name</code>.</li>
<li><strong>class_name</strong>: Locate Element using a <code>ClassName</code>.</li>
<li><strong>css_selector</strong>: Select the element using <code>CssSelectors</code>.</li>
<li><strong>xpath</strong>: Locate an element using an <code>XPath</code> expression.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the question now is <strong>Whats New</strong>?</p>
<p>The answer is <strong>Selenium have evolved a lot recently</strong>. <strong><code>WebDriver</code></strong> is now a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><strong><code>W3C Recommendation Candidate</code></strong></a>.

<p>In my experience <strong>CSS</strong> is the preferable selector because it can be concise, is well documented and web developers are likely to have more experience and exposure to it.</p>

<p><strong>id</strong>, <strong>name</strong>, <strong>tag_name</strong> and <strong>class_name</strong> can all be easily reproduced with simple CSS so I would avoid explicitly using those.</p>

<p>e.g. </p>

<p><strong>id</strong> ; <em>#my_id</em></p>

<p><strong>tag_name</strong>; <em>my_tag</em></p>

<p><strong>class_name</strong>; <em>.my_class</em></p>

<p>The use of <strong>XPath</strong> is often much maligned; labeled as slow and unstable.  However I disagree with this view point.</p>

<p>When I interview people I cringe when they say they avoid Xpath because it is slow and brittle. The speed is no longer a concern, and xpath is only as brittle as the person who wrote it.  However, I prefer the syntax of CSS Selectors so that is why I would choose over XPath for the majority of use cases.</p>

<p>There are 3 scenarios in which XPath is the better choice;</p>

<li><p>Multiple CSS Selectors may be replaced with one XPath query (e.g find element then iterate through sub elements can be performed in one xpath)</p></li>
