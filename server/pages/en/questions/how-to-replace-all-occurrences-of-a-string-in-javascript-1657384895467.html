This is covered in the Mozilla Developer Network&apos;s JavaScript Guide on Regular Expressions, where they present the following utility function (which has changed at least twice since this answer was originally written, so make sure to check the MDN site for potential updates):\nfunction escapeRegExp(string) {\n  return string.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\\]\\\\]/g, &apos;\\\\$&amp;&apos;); // $&amp; means the whole matched string\n}\n\nSo in order to make the replaceAll() function above safer, it could be modified to the following if you also include escapeRegExp:\nfunction replaceAll(str, find, replace) {\n  return str.replace(new RegExp(escapeRegExp(find), &apos;g&apos;), replace);\n}\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"For the sake of completeness, I got to thinking about which method I should use to do this. There are basically two ways to do this as suggested by the other answers on this page.\n\nNote: In general, extending the built-in prototypes in JavaScript is generally not recommended. I am providing as extensions on the String prototype simply for purposes of illustration, showing different implementations of a hypothetical standard method on the String built-in prototype.\n\n\n\nRegular Expression Based Implementation\n\nString.prototype.replaceAll = function(search, replacement) {\n    var target = this;\n    return target.replace(new RegExp(search, &apos;g&apos;), replacement);\n};\n\n\nSplit and Join (Functional) Implementation\n\nString.prototype.replaceAll = function(search, replacement) {\n    var target = this;\n    return target.split(search).join(replacement);\n};\n\n\n\n\nNot knowing too much about how regular expressions work behind the scenes in terms of efficiency, I tended to lean toward the split and join implementation in the past without thinking about performance. When I did wonder which was more efficient, and by what margin, I used it as an excuse to find out.\n\nOn my Chrome Windows 8 machine, the regular expression based implementation is the fastest, with the split and join implementation being 53% slower. Meaning the regular expressions are twice as fast for the lorem ipsum input I used.\n\nCheck out this benchmark running these two implementations against each other.\n\n\n\nAs noted in the comment below by @ThomasLeduc and others, there could be an issue with the regular expression-based implementation if search contains certain characters which are reserved as special characters in regular expressions. The implementation assumes that the caller will escape the string beforehand or will only pass strings that are without the characters in the table in Regular Expressions (MDN).\n\nMDN also provides an implementation to escape our strings. It would be nice if this was also standardized as RegExp.escape(str), but alas, it does not exist:\n\nfunction escapeRegExp(str) {\n  return str.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\\]\\\\]/g, &quot;\\\\$&amp;&quot;); // $&amp; means the whole matched string\n}\n\n\nWe could call escapeRegExp within our String.prototype.replaceAll implementation, however, I&apos;m not sure how much this will affect the performance (potentially even for strings for which the escape is not needed, like all alphanumeric strings).\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Update: In the latest versions of most popular browsers, you can use replaceAll\nas shown here:\nlet result = &quot;1 abc 2 abc 3&quot;.replaceAll(&quot;abc&quot;, &quot;xyz&quot;);\n// `result` is &quot;1 xyz 2 xyz 3&quot;\n\nBut check Can I use or another compatibility table first to make sure the browsers you&apos;re targeting have added support for it first.\n\nFor Node and compatibility with older/non-current browsers:\nNote: Don&apos;t use the following solution in performance critical code.\nAs an alternative to regular expressions for a simple literal string, you could use\nstr = &quot;Test abc test test abc test...&quot;.split(&quot;abc&quot;).join(&quot;&quot;);\n\nThe general pattern is\nstr.split(search).join(replacement)\n\nThis used to be faster in some cases than using replaceAll and a regular expression, but that doesn&apos;t seem to be the case anymore in modern browsers.\nBenchmark: https://jsben.ch/TZYzj\nConclusion:\nIf you have a performance critical use case (e.g processing hundreds of strings), use the Regexp method. But for most typical use cases, this is well worth not having to worry about special characters.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution3","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Using a regular expression with the g flag set will replace all:\nsomeString = &apos;the cat looks like a cat&apos;;\nanotherString = someString.replace(/cat/g, &apos;dog&apos;);\n// anotherString now contains &quot;the dog looks like a dog&quot;\n\nSee here also\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Here&apos;s a string prototype function based on the accepted answer:\nString.prototype.replaceAll = function (find, replace) {\n    var str = this;\n    return str.replace(new RegExp(find, &apos;g&apos;), replace);\n};\n\nEDIT\nIf your find will contain special characters then you need to escape them:\nString.prototype.replaceAll = function (find, replace) {\n    var str = this;\n    return str.replace(new RegExp(find.replace(/[-\\/\\\\^$*+?.()|[\\]{}]/g, &apos;\\\\$&amp;&apos;), &apos;g&apos;), replace);\n};\n\nFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/cdbzL/\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution5","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Update:\nIt&apos;s somewhat late for an update, but since I just stumbled on this question, and noticed that my previous answer is not one I&apos;m happy with. Since the question involved replacing a single word, it&apos;s incredible nobody thought of using word boundaries (\\b)\n&apos;a cat is not a caterpillar&apos;.replace(/\\bcat\\b/gi,&apos;dog&apos;);\n//&quot;a dog is not a caterpillar&quot;\n\nThis is a simple regex that avoids replacing parts of words in most cases. However, a dash - is still considered a word boundary. So conditionals can be used in this case to avoid replacing strings like cool-cat:\n&apos;a cat is not a cool-cat&apos;.replace(/\\bcat\\b/gi,&apos;dog&apos;);//wrong\n//&quot;a dog is not a cool-dog&quot; -- nips\n&apos;a cat is not a cool-cat&apos;.replace(/(?:\\b([^-]))cat(?:\\b([^-]))/gi,&apos;$1dog$2&apos;);\n//&quot;a dog is not a cool-cat&quot;\n\n\nBasically, this question is the same as the question here:\nJavascript replace &quot; &apos; &quot; with &quot; &apos;&apos; &quot;\n@Mike, check the answer I gave there... regexp isn&apos;t the only way to replace multiple occurrences of a subsrting, far from it. Think flexible, think split!\nvar newText = &quot;the cat looks like a cat&quot;.split(&apos;cat&apos;).join(&apos;dog&apos;);\n\nAlternatively, to prevent replacing word parts -which the approved answer will do, too! You can get around this issue using regular expressions that are, I admit, somewhat more complex and as an upshot of that, a tad slower, too:\nvar regText = &quot;the cat looks like a cat&quot;.replace(/(?:(^|[^a-z]))(([^a-z]*)(?=cat)cat)(?![a-z])/gi,&quot;$1dog&quot;);\n\nThe output is the same as the accepted answer, however, using the /cat/g expression on this string:\nvar oops = &apos;the cat looks like a cat, not a caterpillar or coolcat&apos;.replace(/cat/g,&apos;dog&apos;);\n//returns &quot;the dog looks like a dog, not a dogerpillar or cooldog&quot; ?? \n\nOops indeed, this probably isn&apos;t what you want. What is, then? IMHO, a regex that only replaces &apos;cat&apos; conditionally. (ie not part of a word), like so:\nvar caterpillar = &apos;the cat looks like a cat, not a caterpillar or coolcat&apos;.replace(/(?:(^|[^a-z]))(([^a-z]*)(?=cat)cat)(?![a-z])/gi,&quot;$1dog&quot;);\n//return &quot;the dog looks like a dog, not a caterpillar or coolcat&quot;\n\nMy guess is, this meets your needs. It&apos;s not fullproof, of course, but it should be enough to get you started. I&apos;d recommend reading some more on these pages. This&apos;ll prove useful in perfecting this expression to meet your specific needs.\nhttp://www.javascriptkit.com/jsref/regexp.shtml\nhttp://www.regular-expressions.info\n\nFinal addition:\nGiven that this question still gets a lot of views, I thought I might add an example of .replace used with a callback function. In this case, it dramatically simplifies the expression and provides even more flexibility, like replacing with correct capitalisation or replacing both cat and cats in one go:\n&apos;Two cats are not 1 Cat! They\\&apos;re just cool-cats, you caterpillar&apos;\n   .replace(/(^|.\\b)(cat)(s?\\b.|$)/gi,function(all,char1,cat,char2)\n    {\n       //check 1st, capitalize if required\n       var replacement = (cat.charAt(0) === &apos;C&apos; ? &apos;D&apos; : &apos;d&apos;) + &apos;og&apos;;\n       if (char1 === &apos; &apos; &amp;&amp; char2 === &apos;s&apos;)\n       {//replace plurals, too\n           cat = replacement + &apos;s&apos;;\n       }\n       else\n       {//do not replace if dashes are matched\n           cat = char1 === &apos;-&apos; || char2 === &apos;-&apos; ? cat : replacement;\n       }\n       return char1 + cat + char2;//return replacement string\n    });\n//returns:\n//Two dogs are not 1 Dog!

<p>In response to comment "what's if 'abc' is passed as a variable?":</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> find = <span class="hljs-string">'abc'</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> re = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">RegExp</span>(find, <span class="hljs-string">'g'</span>);

str = str.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(re, <span class="hljs-string">''</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>In response to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/49153/click-upvote">Click Upvote</a>'s comment, you could simplify it even more:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">replaceAll</span>(<span class="hljs-params">str, find, replace</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> str.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">RegExp</span>(find, <span class="hljs-string">'g'</span>), replace);
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Regular expressions contain special (meta) characters, and as such it is dangerous to blindly pass an argument in the <code>find</code> function above without pre-processing it to escape those characters.  This is covered in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" rel="noreferrer">Mozilla Developer Network</a>'s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions#Escaping" rel="noreferrer">JavaScript Guide on Regular Expressions</a>, where they present the following utility function (which has changed at least twice since this answer was originally written, so make sure to check the MDN site for potential updates):</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">escapeRegExp</span>(<span class="hljs-params">string</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> string.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-regexp">/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'\\$&amp;'</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// $&amp; means the whole matched string</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>So in order to make the <code>replaceAll()</code> function above safer, it could be modified to the following if you also include <code>escapeRegExp</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">replaceAll</span>(<span class="hljs-params">str, find, replace</span>) {

<p>For the sake of completeness, I got to thinking about which method I should use to do this. There are basically two ways to do this as suggested by the other answers on this page.</p>

<h3>Regular Expression Based Implementation</h3>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>.<span class="hljs-property"><span class="hljs-keyword">prototype</span></span>.<span class="hljs-property">replaceAll</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">search, replacement</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> target = <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> target.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">RegExp</span>(search, <span class="hljs-string">'g'</span>), replacement);
};
</code></pre>

<h3>Split and Join (Functional) Implementation</h3>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>.<span class="hljs-property"><span class="hljs-keyword">prototype</span></span>.<span class="hljs-property">replaceAll</span> = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">search, replacement</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> target = <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>;
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> target.<span class="hljs-title function_">split</span>(search).<span class="hljs-title function_">join</span>(replacement);
};
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Not knowing too much about how regular expressions work behind the scenes in terms of efficiency, I tended to lean toward the split and join implementation in the past without thinking about performance. When I did wonder which was more efficient, and by what margin, I used it as an excuse to find out.</p>

<p>On my Chrome Windows&nbsp;8 machine, <strong>the regular expression based implementation is the fastest</strong>, with the <strong>split and join implementation being 53% slower</strong>. Meaning the regular expressions are twice as fast for the lorem ipsum input I used.</p>

<p>Check out this <a href="http://jsben.ch/#/LFfWA" rel="noreferrer"><strong>benchmark</strong></a> running these two implementations against each other.</p>

<hr>

<p>As noted in the comment below by @ThomasLeduc and others, there could be an issue with the regular expression-based implementation if <code>search</code> contains certain characters which are reserved as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions#Using_special_characters" rel="noreferrer">special characters in regular expressions</a>. The implementation assumes that the caller will escape the string beforehand or will only pass strings that are without the characters in the table in <em><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions#Using_special_characters" rel="noreferrer">Regular Expressions</a></em> (MDN).</p>

<p>MDN also provides an implementation to escape our strings. It would be nice if this was also standardized as <code>RegExp.escape(str)</code>, but alas, it does not exist:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">escapeRegExp</span>(<span class="hljs-params">str</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> str.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-regexp">/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"\\$&amp;"</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// $&amp; means the whole matched string</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>We could call <code>escapeRegExp</code> within our <code>String.prototype.replaceAll</code> implementation, however, I'm not sure how much this will affect the performance (potentially even for strings for which the escape is not needed, like all alphanumeric strings).</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> In the latest versions of most popular browsers, you can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replaceAll" rel="noreferrer"><code>replaceAll</code></a>
as shown here:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> result = <span class="hljs-string">"1 abc 2 abc 3"</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">replaceAll</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"abc"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"xyz"</span>);
<span class="hljs-comment">// `result` is "1 xyz 2 xyz 3"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>But check <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=replaceAll" rel="noreferrer">Can I use</a> or another compatibility table first to make sure the browsers you're targeting have added support for it first.</p>
<hr>
<p>For Node and compatibility with older/non-current browsers:</p>
<p><strong>Note: Don't use the following solution in performance critical code.</strong></p>
<p>As an alternative to regular expressions for a simple literal string, you could use</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">str = <span class="hljs-string">"Test abc test test abc test..."</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">split</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"abc"</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">join</span>(<span class="hljs-string">""</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>The general pattern is</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">str.<span class="hljs-title function_">split</span>(search).<span class="hljs-title function_">join</span>(replacement)
</code></pre>
<p>This used to be faster in some cases than using <code>replaceAll</code> and a regular expression, but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore in modern browsers.</p>
<p>Benchmark: <a href="https://jsben.ch/TZYzj" rel="noreferrer">https://jsben.ch/TZYzj</a></p>
<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p>If you have a performance critical use case (e.g processing hundreds of strings), use the Regexp method. But for most typical use cases, this is well worth not having to worry about special characters.</p>

<p><em><strong>Update:</strong></em></p>
<p>It's somewhat late for an update, but since I just stumbled on this question, and noticed that my previous answer is not one I'm happy with. Since the question involved replacing a single word, it's incredible nobody thought of using word boundaries (<code>\b</code>)</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-string">'a cat is not a caterpillar'</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-regexp">/\bcat\b/gi</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'dog'</span>);
<span class="hljs-comment">//"a dog is not a caterpillar"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This is a simple regex that avoids replacing parts of words in most cases. However, a dash <code>-</code> is still considered a word boundary. So conditionals can be used in this case to avoid replacing strings like <code>cool-cat</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-string">'a cat is not a cool-cat'</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-regexp">/\bcat\b/gi</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'dog'</span>);<span class="hljs-comment">//wrong</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">//"a dog is not a cool-dog" -- nips</span>
<span class="hljs-string">'a cat is not a cool-cat'</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-regexp">/(?:\b([^-]))cat(?:\b([^-]))/gi</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'$1dog$2'</span>);
<span class="hljs-comment">//"a dog is not a cool-cat"</span>
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>Basically, this question is the same as the question here:
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9499075/javascript-replace-with/9499926">Javascript replace " ' " with " '' "</a></p>
<p>@Mike, check the answer I gave there... regexp isn't the only way to replace multiple occurrences of a subsrting, far from it. Think flexible, think split!</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> newText = <span class="hljs-string">"the cat looks like a cat"</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">split</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'cat'</span>).<span class="hljs-title function_">join</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'dog'</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, to prevent replacing word parts -which the approved answer will do, too! You can get around this issue using regular expressions that are, I admit, somewhat more complex and as an upshot of that, a tad slower, too:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> regText = <span class="hljs-string">"the cat looks like a cat"</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-regexp">/(?:(^|[^a-z]))(([^a-z]*)(?=cat)cat)(?![a-z])/gi</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"$1dog"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>The output is the same as the accepted answer, however, using the <code>/cat/g</code> expression on this string:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> oops = <span class="hljs-string">'the cat looks like a cat, not a caterpillar or coolcat'</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-regexp">/cat/g</span>,<span class="hljs-string">'dog'</span>);
<span class="hljs-comment">//returns "the dog looks like a dog, not a dogerpillar or cooldog" ?? </span>
</code></pre>
<p>Oops indeed, this probably isn't what you want. What is, then? IMHO, a regex that only replaces 'cat' conditionally. (ie not part of a word), like so:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> caterpillar = <span class="hljs-string">'the cat looks like a cat, not a caterpillar or coolcat'</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-regexp">/(?:(^|[^a-z]))(([^a-z]*)(?=cat)cat)(?![a-z])/gi</span>,<span class="hljs-string">"$1dog"</span>);
<span class="hljs-comment">//return "the dog looks like a dog, not a caterpillar or coolcat"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>My guess is, this meets your needs. It's not fullproof, of course, but it should be enough to get you started. I'd recommend reading some more on these pages. This'll prove useful in perfecting this expression to meet your specific needs.</p>

<p><strong>Final addition:</strong></p>
<p>Given that this question still gets a lot of views, I thought I might add an example of <code>.replace</code> used with a callback function. In this case, it dramatically simplifies the expression <em>and</em> provides even more flexibility, like replacing with correct capitalisation or replacing both <code>cat</code> and <code>cats</code> in one go:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-string">'Two cats are not 1 Cat! They\'re just cool-cats, you caterpillar'</span>

<p>Or try the <code>replaceAll</code> method, as recommended in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1137436/useful-javascript-methods-that-extends-built-in-objects/1137579#1137579">this answer</a>:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">str = str.<span class="hljs-title function_">replaceAll</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'abc'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">''</span>);

str = str.<span class="hljs-title function_">replaceAll</span>(search, <span class="hljs-string">''</span>);
</code></pre>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Clarification about <code>replaceAll</code> availability</p>
<p>The <code>replaceAll</code> method is added to <code>String</code>'s prototype. This means it will be available for all string objects/literals.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> output = <span class="hljs-string">"test this"</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">replaceAll</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'this'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'that'</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// output is 'test that'.</span>

<p>Using <code>RegExp</code> in <strong>JavaScript</strong> could do the job for you, just simply do something like below code, don't forget the <code>/g</code> after which standout for <strong>global</strong>:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> str =<span class="hljs-string">"Test abc test test abc test test test abc test test abc"</span>;
str = str.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-regexp">/abc/g</span>, <span class="hljs-string">''</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>If you think of reuse, create a function to do that for you, but it's not recommended as it's only one line function, but again if you heavily use this, you can write something like this:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>.<span class="hljs-property"><span class="hljs-keyword">prototype</span></span>.<span class="hljs-property">replaceAll</span> = <span class="hljs-title class_">String</span>.<span class="hljs-property"><span class="hljs-keyword">prototype</span></span>.<span class="hljs-property">replaceAll</span> || <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">string, replaced</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">RegExp</span>(string, <span class="hljs-string">'g'</span>), replaced);
};
</code></pre>

<p>and simply use it in your code over and over like below:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> str =<span class="hljs-string">"Test abc test test abc test test test abc test test abc"</span>;
str = str.<span class="hljs-title function_">replaceAll</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'abc'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">''</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>But as I mention earlier, it won't make a huge difference in terms of lines to be written or performance, only caching the function may effect some faster performance on long strings and also a good practice of DRY code if you want to reuse.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>Today 27.12.2019 I perform tests on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_High_Sierra" rel="noreferrer">macOS v10.13.6</a> (High Sierra) for the chosen solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>str.replace(/abc/g, '');</code> (<strong>C</strong>) is a good cross-browser fast solution for all strings.</li>
<li>Solutions based on <code>split-join</code> (<strong>A,B</strong>) or <code>replace</code> (<strong>C,D</strong>) are fast</li>
<li>Solutions based on <code>while</code> (<strong>E,F,G,H</strong>) are slow - usually ~4 times slower for small strings and about ~3000 times (!) slower for long strings</li>
<li>The recurrence solutions (<strong>RA,RB</strong>) are slow and do not work for long strings</li>
</ul>
<p>I also create my own solution. It looks like currently it is the shortest one which does the question job:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">str.<span class="hljs-property">split</span><span class="hljs-string">`abc`</span>.<span class="hljs-property">join</span><span class="hljs-string">``</span>

<h2>Details</h2>
<p>The tests were performed on Chrome 79.0, Safari 13.0.4 and Firefox 71.0 (64 bit). The tests <code>RA</code> and <code>RB</code> use recursion. Results</p>

<h2>Long string: 275 000 characters</h2>
<p>The recursive solutions <strong>RA</strong> and <strong>RB</strong> gives</p>

<p>For 1M characters they even break Chrome</p>

<p>I try to perform tests for 1M characters for other solutions, but <strong>E,F,G,H</strong> takes so much time that browser ask me to break script so I shrink test string to 275K characters.

<p>worked better for me than the above answers. so <code>new RegExp("abc", 'g')</code> creates a RegExp what matches all occurence (<code>'g'</code> flag) of the text (<code>"abc"</code>). The second part is what gets replaced to, in your case empty string (<code>""</code>).
<code>str</code> is the string, and we have to override it, as <code>replace(...)</code> just returns result, but not overrides. In some cases you might want to use that.</p>

<p>This is the <strong>fastest</strong> version that <em>doesn't use regular expressions</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://jsperf.com/replace-all-vs-split-join/10" rel="noreferrer">Revised jsperf</a></p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">replaceAll = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">string, omit, place, prevstring</span>) {

</code></pre>

<p>It is almost <strong>twice</strong> as fast as the split and join method.</p>

<p>As pointed out in a comment here, this will not work if your <code>omit</code> variable contains <code>place</code>, as in: <code>replaceAll("string", "s", "ss")</code>, because it will always be able to replace another occurrence of the word.</p>

<p>There is another jsperf with variants on my recursive replace that go even faster (<a href="http://jsperf.com/replace-all-vs-split-join/12" rel="noreferrer">http://jsperf.com/replace-all-vs-split-join/12</a>)!</p>

<p>It's now supported in <strong>Chrome 85+, Edge 85+, Firefox 77+, Safari 13.1+</strong>.</p>

str = str.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-regexp">/abc/g</span>, <span class="hljs-string">''</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>When complete, you will still have 'test abc'!</p>

<p>The simplest loop to solve this would be:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> str = <span class="hljs-string">'test aabcbc'</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> (str != str.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-regexp">/abc/g</span>, <span class="hljs-string">''</span>)){
   str.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-regexp">/abc/g</span>, <span class="hljs-string">''</span>);
}
</code></pre>

<p>But that runs the replacement twice for each cycle. Perhaps (at risk of being voted down) that can be combined for a slightly more efficient but less readable form:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> str = <span class="hljs-string">'test aabcbc'</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> (str != (str = str.<span class="hljs-title function_">replace</span>(<span class="hljs-regexp">/abc/g</span>, <span class="hljs-string">''</span>))){}
<span class="hljs-comment">// alert(str); alerts 'test '!</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This can be particularly useful when looking for duplicate strings.<br>
For example, if we have 'a,,,b' and we wish to remove all duplicate commas.<br>
[In that case, one could do .replace(/,+/g,','), but at some point the regex gets complex and slow enough to loop instead.]</p>

<p>Although people have mentioned the use of regex but there's a better approach if you want to replace the text irrespective of the case of the text. Like uppercase or lowercase. Use below syntax</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-comment">//Consider below example</span>
