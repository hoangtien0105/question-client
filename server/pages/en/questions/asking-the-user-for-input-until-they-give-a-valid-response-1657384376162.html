min_:\n        raise ValueError(&quot;min_ must be less than or equal to max_.&quot;)\n    while True:\n        ui = input(prompt)\n        if type_ is not None:\n            try:\n                ui = type_(ui)\n            except ValueError:\n                print(&quot;Input type must be {0}.&quot;.format(type_.__name__))\n                continue\n        if max_ is not None and ui &gt;

This increases the likelihood of bugs in your system. What if you want to backport to 2.7 by changing input to raw_input, but accidentally change only the first input above? It&apos;s a SyntaxError just waiting to happen.\n\nRecursion Will Blow Your Stack\n\nIf you&apos;ve just learned about recursion, you might be tempted to use it in get_non_negative_int so you can dispose of the while loop.\n\ndef get_non_negative_int(prompt):\n    try:\n        value = int(input(prompt))\n    except ValueError:\n        print(&quot;Sorry, I didn&apos;t understand that.&quot;)\n        return get_non_negative_int(prompt)\n\n    if value &lt; 0:\n        print(&quot;Sorry, your response must not be negative.&quot;)\n        return get_non_negative_int(prompt)\n    else:\n        return value\n\n\nThis appears to work fine most of the time, but if the user enters invalid data enough times, the script will terminate with a RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded.

Try again: &quot;))\n\nThis combination of itertools.chain and itertools.repeat will create an iterator\nwhich will yield strings &quot;Enter a number: &quot; once, and &quot;Not a number! Try again: &quot; an infinite number of times:\nfor prompt in prompts:\n    print(prompt)\n\nEnter a number: \nNot a number! Try again: \nNot a number! Try again: \nNot a number! Try again: \n# ... and so on\n\n\nreplies = map(input, prompts) - here map will apply all the prompts strings from the previous step to the input function. E.g.:\nfor reply in replies:\n    print(reply)\n\nEnter a number:  a\na\nNot a number! Try again:  1\n1\nNot a number! Try again:  it doesn&apos;t care now\nit doesn&apos;t care now\n# and so on...\n\n\nWe use filter and str.isdigit to filter out those strings that contain only digits:\nonly_digits = filter(str.isdigit, replies)\nfor reply in only_digits:\n    print(reply)\n\nEnter a number:  a\nNot a number! Try again:  1\n1\nNot a number! Try again:  2\n2\nNot a number! Try again:  b\nNot a number! Try again: # and so on...\n\nAnd to get only the first digits-only string we use next.\n\nOther validation rules:\n\nString methods: Of course you can use other string methods like str.isalpha to get only alphabetic strings, or str.isupper to get only uppercase. See docs for the full list.\n\nMembership testing:\nThere are several different ways to perform it. One of them is by using __contains__ method:\nfrom itertools import chain, repeat\n\nfruits = {&apos;apple&apos;, &apos;orange&apos;, &apos;peach&apos;}\nprompts = chain([&quot;Enter a fruit: &quot;], repeat(&quot;I don&apos;t know this one! Try again: &quot;))\nreplies = map(input, prompts)\nvalid_response = next(filter(fruits.__contains__, replies))\nprint(valid_response)\n\nEnter a fruit:  1\nI don&apos;t know this one! Try again:  foo\nI don&apos;t know this one! Try again:  apple\napple\n\n\nNumbers comparison:\nThere are useful comparison methods which we can use here. For example, for __lt__ (&lt;):\nfrom itertools import chain, repeat\n\nprompts = chain([&quot;Enter a positive number:&quot;], repeat(&quot;I need a positive number! Try again:&quot;))\nreplies = map(input, prompts)\nnumeric_strings = filter(str.isnumeric, replies)\nnumbers = map(float, numeric_strings)\nis_positive = (0.).__lt__\nvalid_response = next(filter(is_positive, numbers))\nprint(valid_response)\n\nEnter a positive number: a\nI need a positive number! Try again: -5\nI need a positive number! Try again: 0\nI need a positive number! Try again: 5\n5.0\n\nOr, if you don&apos;t like using dunder methods (dunder = double-underscore), you can always define your own function, or use the ones from the operator module.\n\nPath existance:\nHere one can use pathlib library and its Path.exists method:\nfrom itertools import chain, repeat\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nprompts = chain([&quot;Enter a path: &quot;], repeat(&quot;This path doesn&apos;t exist! Try again: &quot;))\nreplies = map(input, prompts)\npaths = map(Path, replies)\nvalid_response = next(filter(Path.exists, paths))\nprint(valid_response)\n\nEnter a path:  a b c\nThis path doesn&apos;t exist! Try again:  1\nThis path doesn&apos;t exist! Try again:  existing_file.txt\nexisting_file.txt\n\n\n\nLimiting number of tries:\nIf you don&apos;t want to torture a user by asking him something an infinite number of times, you can specify a limit in a call of itertools.repeat. This can be combined with providing a default value to the next function:\nfrom itertools import chain, repeat\n\nprompts = chain([&quot;Enter a number:&quot;], repeat(&quot;Not a number! Try again:&quot;, 2))\nreplies = map(input, prompts)\nvalid_response = next(filter(str.isdigit, replies), None)\nprint(&quot;You&apos;ve failed miserably!&quot; if valid_response is None else &apos;Well done!&apos;)\n\nEnter a number: a\nNot a number! Try again: b\nNot a number! Try again: c\nYou&apos;ve failed miserably!\n\nPreprocessing input data:\nSometimes we don&apos;t want to reject an input if the user accidentally supplied it IN CAPS or with a space in the beginning or an end of the string. To take these simple mistakes into account we can preprocess the input data by applying str.lower and str.strip methods. For example, for the case of membership testing the code will look like this:\nfrom itertools import chain, repeat\n\nfruits = {&apos;apple&apos;, &apos;orange&apos;, &apos;peach&apos;}\nprompts = chain([&quot;Enter a fruit: &quot;], repeat(&quot;I don&apos;t know this one! Try again: &quot;))\nreplies = map(input, prompts)\nlowercased_replies = map(str.lower, replies)\nstripped_replies = map(str.strip, lowercased_replies)\nvalid_response = next(filter(fruits.__contains__, stripped_replies))\nprint(valid_response)\n\nEnter a fruit:  duck\nI don&apos;t know this one! Try again:     Orange\norange\n\nIn the case when you have many functions to use for preprocessing, it might be easier to use a function performing a function composition. For example, using the one from here:\nfrom itertools import chain, repeat\n\nfrom lz.functional import compose\n\nfruits = {&apos;apple&apos;, &apos;orange&apos;, &apos;peach&apos;}\nprompts = chain([&quot;Enter a fruit: &quot;], repeat(&quot;I don&apos;t know this one! Try again: &quot;))\nreplies = map(input, prompts)\nprocess = compose(str.strip, str.lower)  # you can add more functions here\nprocessed_replies = map(process, replies)\nvalid_response = next(filter(fruits.__contains__, processed_replies))\nprint(valid_response)\n\nEnter a fruit:  potato\nI don&apos;t know this one! Try again:   PEACH\npeach\n\nCombining validation rules:\nFor a simple case, for example, when the program asks for age between 1 and 120, one can just add another filter:\nfrom itertools import chain, repeat\n\nprompt_msg = &quot;Enter your age (1-120): &quot;\nbad_input_msg = &quot;Wrong input.&quot;\nprompts = chain([prompt_msg], repeat(&apos;\\n&apos;.join([bad_input_msg, prompt_msg])))\nreplies = map(input, prompts)\nnumeric_replies = filter(str.isdigit, replies)\nages = map(int, numeric_replies)\npositive_ages = filter((0).__lt__, ages)\nnot_too_big_ages = filter((120).__ge__, positive_ages)\nvalid_response = next(not_too_big_ages)\nprint(valid_response)\n\nBut in the case when there are many rules, it&apos;s better to implement a function performing a logical conjunction. In the following example I will use a ready one from here:\nfrom functools import partial\nfrom itertools import chain, repeat\n\nfrom lz.logical import conjoin\n\n\ndef is_one_letter(string: str) -&gt; bool:\n    return len(string) == 1\n\n\nrules = [str.isalpha, str.isupper, is_one_letter, &apos;C&apos;.__le__, &apos;P&apos;.__ge__]\n\nprompt_msg = &quot;Enter a letter (C-P): &quot;\nbad_input_msg = &quot;Wrong input.&quot;\nprompts = chain([prompt_msg], repeat(&apos;\\n&apos;.join([bad_input_msg, prompt_msg])))\nreplies = map(input, prompts)\nvalid_response = next(filter(conjoin(*rules), replies))\nprint(valid_response)\n\nEnter a letter (C-P):  5\nWrong input.\nEnter a letter (C-P):  f\nWrong input.\nEnter a letter (C-P):  CDE\nWrong input.\nEnter a letter (C-P):  Q\nWrong input.\nEnter a letter (C-P):  N\nN\n\nUnfortunately, if someone needs a custom message for each failed case, then, I&apos;m afraid, there is no pretty functional way. Or, at least, I couldn&apos;t find one.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution4","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Using Click:\nClick is a library for command-line interfaces and it provides functionality for asking a valid response from a user.\nSimple example:\nimport click\n\nnumber = click.prompt(&apos;Please enter a number&apos;, type=float)\nprint(number)\n\nPlease enter a number: \n a\nError: a is not a valid floating point value\nPlease enter a number: \n 10\n10.0\n\nNote how it converted the string value to a float automatically.\nChecking if a value is within a range:\nThere are different custom types provided.

</code></pre>
<p>The program works as expected as long as the the user enters meaningful data.</p>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>Please enter your age: 23
You are able to vote in the United States!
</code></pre>
<p>But it fails if the user enters invalid data:</p>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>Please enter your age: dickety six
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "canyouvote.py", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
    age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'dickety six'
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of crashing, I would like the program to ask for the input again. Like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>Please enter your age: dickety six
Sorry, I didn't understand that.
Please enter your age: 26
You are able to vote in the United States!
</code></pre>
<p>How do I ask for valid input instead of crashing or accepting invalid values (e.g. <code>-1</code>)?</p>

<p>The simplest way to accomplish this is to put the <code>input</code> method in a while loop. Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops" rel="noreferrer"><code>continue</code></a> when you get bad input, and <code>break</code> out of the loop when you're satisfied.</p>

<h2>When Your Input Might Raise an Exception</h2>

<p>Use <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions" rel="noreferrer"><code>try</code> and <code>except</code></a> to detect when the user enters data that can't be parsed.</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> <span class="hljs-literal">True</span>:
    <span class="hljs-keyword">try</span>:
        <span class="hljs-comment"># Note: Python 2.x users should use raw_input, the equivalent of 3.x's input</span>
        age = <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Please enter your age: "</span>))

    <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:

<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"You are not able to vote in the United States."</span>)
</code></pre>

<h2>Implementing Your Own Validation Rules</h2>

<p>If you want to reject values that Python can successfully parse, you can add your own validation logic.</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> <span class="hljs-literal">True</span>:
    data = <span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Please enter a loud message (must be all caps): "</span>)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> data.isupper():
        <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Sorry, your response was not loud enough."</span>)
        <span class="hljs-keyword">continue</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
        <span class="hljs-comment">#we're happy with the value given.</span>
        <span class="hljs-comment">#we're ready to exit the loop.</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> <span class="hljs-literal">True</span>:
    data = <span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Pick an answer from A to D:"</span>)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> data.lower() <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> (<span class="hljs-string">'a'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'b'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'c'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'d'</span>):
        <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Not an appropriate choice."</span>)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
        <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>
</code></pre>

<h2>Combining Exception Handling and Custom Validation</h2>

<p>Both of the above techniques can be combined into one loop.</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> <span class="hljs-literal">True</span>:
    <span class="hljs-keyword">try</span>:

        <span class="hljs-keyword">continue</span>

<h2>Encapsulating it All in a Function</h2>

<p>If you need to ask your user for a lot of different values, it might be useful to put this code in a function, so you don't have to retype it every time.</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">get_non_negative_int</span>(<span class="hljs-params">prompt</span>):
    <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> <span class="hljs-literal">True</span>:
        <span class="hljs-keyword">try</span>:
            value = <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>(prompt))
        <span class="hljs-keyword">except</span> ValueError:
            <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Sorry, I didn't understand that."</span>)
            <span class="hljs-keyword">continue</span>

        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> value &lt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span>:
            <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Sorry, your response must not be negative."</span>)
            <span class="hljs-keyword">continue</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
            <span class="hljs-keyword">break</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> value

age = get_non_negative_int(<span class="hljs-string">"Please enter your age: "</span>)
kids = get_non_negative_int(<span class="hljs-string">"Please enter the number of children you have: "</span>)
salary = get_non_negative_int(<span class="hljs-string">"Please enter your yearly earnings, in dollars: "</span>)
</code></pre>

<h3>Putting It All Together</h3>

<p>You can extend this idea to make a very generic input function:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">sanitised_input</span>(<span class="hljs-params">prompt, type_=<span class="hljs-literal">None</span>, min_=<span class="hljs-literal">None</span>, max_=<span class="hljs-literal">None</span>, range_=<span class="hljs-literal">None</span></span>):

        <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
            <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> ui
</code></pre>

<p>With usage such as:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">age = sanitised_input(<span class="hljs-string">"Enter your age: "</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">101</span>)

</code></pre>

<h2>Common Pitfalls, and Why you Should Avoid Them</h2>

<h3>The Redundant Use of Redundant <code>input</code> Statements</h3>

<p>This method works but is generally considered poor style:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">data = <span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Please enter a loud message (must be all caps): "</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">not</span> data.isupper():
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Sorry, your response was not loud enough."</span>)
    data = <span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Please enter a loud message (must be all caps): "</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>It might look attractive initially because it's shorter than the <code>while True</code> method, but it violates the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" rel="noreferrer">Don't Repeat Yourself</a> principle of software development. This increases the likelihood of bugs in your system. What if you want to backport to 2.7 by changing <code>input</code> to <code>raw_input</code>, but accidentally change only the first <code>input</code> above? It's a <code>SyntaxError</code> just waiting to happen.</p>

<h3>Recursion Will Blow Your Stack</h3>

<p>If you've just learned about recursion, you might be tempted to use it in <code>get_non_negative_int</code> so you can dispose of the while loop.</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">get_non_negative_int</span>(<span class="hljs-params">prompt</span>):
    <span class="hljs-keyword">try</span>:
        value = <span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>(prompt))
    <span class="hljs-keyword">except</span> ValueError:
        <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Sorry, I didn't understand that."</span>)
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> get_non_negative_int(prompt)

    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> value &lt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span>:
        <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"Sorry, your response must not be negative."</span>)
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> get_non_negative_int(prompt)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> value
</code></pre>

<p>This appears to work fine most of the time, but if the user enters invalid data enough times, the script will terminate with a <code>RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded</code>. You may think "no fool would make 1000 mistakes in a row", but you're underestimating the ingenuity of fools!</p>

<p>Why would you do a <code>while True</code> and then break out of this loop while you can also just put your requirements in the while statement since all you want is to stop once you have the age?</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">prompts = chain([<span class="hljs-string">"Enter a number: "</span>], repeat(<span class="hljs-string">"Not a number! Try again: "</span>))

This combination of <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain" rel="noreferrer"><code>itertools.chain</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html#itertools.repeat" rel="noreferrer"><code>itertools.repeat</code></a> will create an iterator
which will yield strings <code>"Enter a number: "</code> once, and <code>"Not a number! Try again: "</code> an infinite number of times:
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> prompt <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> prompts:

</code></pre>
</li>
<li><code>replies = map(input, prompts)</code> - here <a href="https://docs.python.org/howto/functional.html#built-in-functions" rel="noreferrer"><code>map</code></a> will apply all the <code>prompts</code> strings from the previous step to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#input" rel="noreferrer"><code>input</code></a> function. E.g.:
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> reply <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> replies:
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(reply)

a
Not a number! Try again:  1
1
Not a number! Try again:  it doesn't care now
it doesn't care now
# and so on...
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>We use <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#filter" rel="noreferrer"><code>filter</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdigit" rel="noreferrer"><code>str.isdigit</code></a> to filter out those strings that contain only digits:

And to get only the first digits-only string we use <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#next" rel="noreferrer"><code>next</code></a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Other validation rules:</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>String methods:</strong> Of course you can use other string methods like <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalpha" rel="noreferrer"><code>str.isalpha</code></a> to get only alphabetic strings, or <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#str.isupper" rel="noreferrer"><code>str.isupper</code></a> to get only uppercase. See <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods" rel="noreferrer">docs</a> for the full list.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Membership testing:</strong><br>
There are several different ways to perform it. One of them is by using <a href="https://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#object.__contains__" rel="noreferrer"><code>__contains__</code></a> method:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> itertools <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> chain, repeat

fruits = {<span class="hljs-string">'apple'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'orange'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'peach'</span>}
prompts = chain([<span class="hljs-string">"Enter a fruit: "</span>], repeat(<span class="hljs-string">"I don't know this one! Try again: "</span>))
replies = <span class="hljs-built_in">map</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>, prompts)
valid_response = <span class="hljs-built_in">next</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">filter</span>(fruits.__contains__, replies))
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(valid_response)
</code></pre>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>Enter a fruit:  1
I don't know this one! Try again:  foo
I don't know this one! Try again:  apple
apple
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Numbers comparison:</strong><br>
There are useful comparison methods which we can use here. For example, for <a href="https://docs.python.org/reference/datamodel.html#object.__lt__" rel="noreferrer"><code>__lt__</code></a> (<code>&lt;</code>):</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> itertools <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> chain, repeat

prompts = chain([<span class="hljs-string">"Enter a positive number:"</span>], repeat(<span class="hljs-string">"I need a positive number! Try again:"</span>))
replies = <span class="hljs-built_in">map</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>, prompts)
numeric_strings = <span class="hljs-built_in">filter</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">str</span>.isnumeric, replies)
numbers = <span class="hljs-built_in">map</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">float</span>, numeric_strings)
is_positive = (<span class="hljs-number">0.</span>).__lt__
valid_response = <span class="hljs-built_in">next</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">filter</span>(is_positive, numbers))
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(valid_response)
</code></pre>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>Enter a positive number: a
I need a positive number! Try again: -5
I need a positive number! Try again: 0
I need a positive number! Try again: 5
5.0
</code></pre>
<p>Or, if you don't like using dunder methods (dunder = double-underscore), you can always define your own function, or use the ones from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/operator.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>operator</code></a> module.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Path existance:</strong><br>
Here one can use <code>pathlib</code> library and its <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.exists" rel="noreferrer"><code>Path.exists</code></a> method:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> itertools <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> chain, repeat

paths = <span class="hljs-built_in">map</span>(Path, replies)
valid_response = <span class="hljs-built_in">next</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">filter</span>(Path.exists, paths))
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(valid_response)
</code></pre>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>Enter a path:  a b c
This path doesn't exist! Try again:  1
This path doesn't exist! Try again:  existing_file.txt
existing_file.txt
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Limiting number of tries:</h2>
<p>If you don't want to torture a user by asking him something an infinite number of times, you can specify a limit in a call of <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/itertools.html#itertools.repeat" rel="noreferrer"><code>itertools.repeat</code></a>. This can be combined with providing a default value to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#next" rel="noreferrer"><code>next</code></a> function:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> itertools <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> chain, repeat

prompts = chain([<span class="hljs-string">"Enter a number:"</span>], repeat(<span class="hljs-string">"Not a number! Try again:"</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>))

valid_response = <span class="hljs-built_in">next</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">filter</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">str</span>.isdigit, replies), <span class="hljs-literal">None</span>)
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(<span class="hljs-string">"You've failed miserably!"</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> valid_response <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> <span class="hljs-literal">None</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">else</span> <span class="hljs-string">'Well done!'</span>)

<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>Enter a number: a

<h2>Preprocessing input data:</h2>
<p>Sometimes we don't want to reject an input if the user accidentally supplied it <em>IN CAPS</em> or with a space in the beginning or an end of the string. To take these simple mistakes into account we can preprocess the input data by applying <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#str.lower" rel="noreferrer"><code>str.lower</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#str.strip" rel="noreferrer"><code>str.strip</code></a> methods. For example, for the case of membership testing the code will look like this:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> itertools <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> chain, repeat

fruits = {<span class="hljs-string">'apple'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'orange'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'peach'</span>}
prompts = chain([<span class="hljs-string">"Enter a fruit: "</span>], repeat(<span class="hljs-string">"I don't know this one! Try again: "</span>))
replies = <span class="hljs-built_in">map</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>, prompts)
lowercased_replies = <span class="hljs-built_in">map</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">str</span>.lower, replies)
stripped_replies = <span class="hljs-built_in">map</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">str</span>.strip, lowercased_replies)
valid_response = <span class="hljs-built_in">next</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">filter</span>(fruits.__contains__, stripped_replies))
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(valid_response)
</code></pre>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>Enter a fruit:  duck
I don't know this one! Try again:     Orange
orange
</code></pre>
<p>In the case when you have many functions to use for preprocessing, it might be easier to use a function performing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition_(computer_science)" rel="noreferrer">function composition</a>. For example, using the one from <a href="https://lz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lz.html#lz.functional.compose" rel="noreferrer">here</a>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> itertools <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> chain, repeat

<span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> lz.functional <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> compose

fruits = {<span class="hljs-string">'apple'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'orange'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'peach'</span>}
prompts = chain([<span class="hljs-string">"Enter a fruit: "</span>], repeat(<span class="hljs-string">"I don't know this one! Try again: "</span>))
replies = <span class="hljs-built_in">map</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>, prompts)
process = compose(<span class="hljs-built_in">str</span>.strip, <span class="hljs-built_in">str</span>.lower)  <span class="hljs-comment"># you can add more functions here</span>
processed_replies = <span class="hljs-built_in">map</span>(process, replies)
valid_response = <span class="hljs-built_in">next</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">filter</span>(fruits.__contains__, processed_replies))
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(valid_response)
</code></pre>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>Enter a fruit:  potato
I don't know this one! Try again:   PEACH
peach
</code></pre>
<h2>Combining validation rules:</h2>
<p>For a simple case, for example, when the program asks for age between 1 and 120, one can just add another <code>filter</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> itertools <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> chain, repeat

prompt_msg = <span class="hljs-string">"Enter your age (1-120): "</span>
bad_input_msg = <span class="hljs-string">"Wrong input."</span>
prompts = chain([prompt_msg], repeat(<span class="hljs-string">'\n'</span>.join([bad_input_msg, prompt_msg])))
replies = <span class="hljs-built_in">map</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>, prompts)
numeric_replies = <span class="hljs-built_in">filter</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">str</span>.isdigit, replies)
ages = <span class="hljs-built_in">map</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>, numeric_replies)
positive_ages = <span class="hljs-built_in">filter</span>((<span class="hljs-number">0</span>).__lt__, ages)
not_too_big_ages = <span class="hljs-built_in">filter</span>((<span class="hljs-number">120</span>).__ge__, positive_ages)
valid_response = <span class="hljs-built_in">next</span>(not_too_big_ages)
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(valid_response)
</code></pre>
<p>But in the case when there are many rules, it's better to implement a function performing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction" rel="noreferrer">logical conjunction</a>. In the following example I will use a ready one from <a href="https://lz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lz.html#lz.logical.conjoin" rel="noreferrer">here</a>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> functools <span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> partial

    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">len</span>(string) == <span class="hljs-number">1</span>


rules = [<span class="hljs-built_in">str</span>.isalpha, <span class="hljs-built_in">str</span>.isupper, is_one_letter, <span class="hljs-string">'C'</span>.__le__, <span class="hljs-string">'P'</span>.__ge__]

prompt_msg = <span class="hljs-string">"Enter a letter (C-P): "</span>
bad_input_msg = <span class="hljs-string">"Wrong input."</span>
prompts = chain([prompt_msg], repeat(<span class="hljs-string">'\n'</span>.join([bad_input_msg, prompt_msg])))
replies = <span class="hljs-built_in">map</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">input</span>, prompts)
valid_response = <span class="hljs-built_in">next</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">filter</span>(conjoin(*rules), replies))
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(valid_response)
</code></pre>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>Enter a letter (C-P):  5

<h1>Using <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/" rel="noreferrer"><em>Click</em></a>:</h1>
<p><em>Click</em> is a library for command-line interfaces and it provides functionality for asking a valid response from a user.</p>
<p>Simple example:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> click

number = click.prompt(<span class="hljs-string">'Please enter a number'</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">type</span>=<span class="hljs-built_in">float</span>)
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(number)
</code></pre>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>Please enter a number: 
 a
Error: a is not a valid floating point value
Please enter a number: 
 10
10.0
</code></pre>
<p>Note how it converted the string value to a float automatically.</p>
<h2>Checking if a value is within a range:</h2>
<p>There are different <a href="https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/parameters/#parameter-types" rel="noreferrer">custom types</a> provided. To get a number in a specific range we can use <code>IntRange</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">age = click.prompt(<span class="hljs-string">"What's your age?"</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">type</span>=click.IntRange(<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">120</span>))
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(age)
</code></pre>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>What's your age?: 
 a
Error: a is not a valid integer
What's your age?: 
 0
Error: 0 is not in the valid range of 1 to 120.
What's your age?: 
 5
5
</code></pre>
<p>We can also specify just one of the limits, <code>min</code> or <code>max</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">age = click.prompt(<span class="hljs-string">"What's your age?"</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">type</span>=click.IntRange(<span class="hljs-built_in">min</span>=<span class="hljs-number">14</span>))
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(age)
</code></pre>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>What's your age?: 
 0
Error: 0 is smaller than the minimum valid value 14.
What's your age?: 
 18
18
</code></pre>
<h2>Membership testing:</h2>
<p>Using <code>click.Choice</code> type. By default this check is case-sensitive.</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">choices = {<span class="hljs-string">'apple'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'orange'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'peach'</span>}
choice = click.prompt(<span class="hljs-string">'Provide a fruit'</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">type</span>=click.Choice(choices, case_sensitive=<span class="hljs-literal">False</span>))
<span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(choice)
</code></pre>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>Provide a fruit (apple, peach, orange): 
 banana
Error: invalid choice: banana. (choose from apple, peach, orange)
Provide a fruit (apple, peach, orange):

</code></pre>
<h2>Working with paths and files:</h2>
<p>Using a <code>click.Path</code> type we can check for existing paths and also resolve them:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">path = click.prompt(<span class="hljs-string">'Provide path'</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">type</span>=click.Path(exists=<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>, resolve_path=<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>))

</code></pre>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>Provide path: 
 nonexistent
Error: Path "nonexistent" does not exist.
Provide path: 
 existing_folder
'/path/to/existing_folder
</code></pre>
<p>Reading and writing files can be done by <code>click.File</code>:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">file = click.prompt(<span class="hljs-string">'In which file to write data?'</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">type</span>=click.File(<span class="hljs-string">'w'</span>))
<span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> file.<span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>():
    file.write(<span class="hljs-string">'Hello!'</span>)
<span class="hljs-comment"># More info about `lazy=True` at:</span>
<span class="hljs-comment"># https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/arguments/#file-opening-safety</span>
file = click.prompt(<span class="hljs-string">'Which file you wanna read?'</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">type</span>=click.File(lazy=<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>))
<span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> file.<span class="hljs-built_in">open</span>():
    <span class="hljs-built_in">print</span>(file.read())
</code></pre>
<pre class="lang-none s-code-block"><code>In which file to write data?:

<h2>Other examples:</h2>
<h3>Password confirmation:</h3>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">password = click.prompt(<span class="hljs-string">'Enter password'</span>, hide_input=<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>, confirmation_prompt=<span class="hljs-literal">True</span>)

<h3>Default values:</h3>
<p>In this case, simply pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> (or whatever key you use) without entering a value, will give you a default one:</p>
<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">number = click.prompt(<span class="hljs-string">'Please enter a number'</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">type</span>=<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>, default=<span class="hljs-number">42</span>)

<p>You can find the complete module <a href="https://github.com/catb0t/input_constrain" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">$ ./input_constrain.py
can you vote? age : a
sorry, age can only consist of digits.
$ ./input_constrain.py 
can you vote? age : <span class="hljs-number">23</span>&lt;RETURN&gt;
your age <span class="hljs-keyword">is</span> <span class="hljs-number">23</span>
You can vote!
$ _
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the nature of this implementation is it closes stdin as soon as something that isn't a digit is read. I didn't hit enter after <code>a</code>, but I needed to after the numbers.</p>

<p>You could merge this with the <code>thismany()</code> function in the same module to only allow, say, three digits.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I opted for explicit <code>if</code> and <code>raise</code> statements instead of an <code>assert</code>,
because assertion checking may be turned off,
whereas validation should always be on to provide robustness.</p>

<p>This may be used to get different kinds of input,
with different validation conditions.
For example:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python"><span class="hljs-comment"># No validation, equivalent to simple input:</span>
anystr = validate_input(<span class="hljs-string">"Enter any string: "</span>)

<span class="hljs-comment"># Get a string containing only letters:</span>
letters = validate_input(<span class="hljs-string">"Enter letters: "</span>,
    cond=<span class="hljs-built_in">str</span>.isalpha,
    onerror={ValidationError: <span class="hljs-string">"Only letters, please!"</span>})

<span class="hljs-comment"># Get a float in [0, 100]:</span>
percentage = validate_input(<span class="hljs-string">"Percentage? "</span>,
    cast=<span class="hljs-built_in">float</span>, cond=<span class="hljs-keyword">lambda</span> x: <span class="hljs-number">0.0</span>&lt;=x&lt;=<span class="hljs-number">100.0</span>,
    onerror={ValidationError: <span class="hljs-string">"Must be between 0 and 100!"</span>,
             ValueError: <span class="hljs-string">"Not a number!"</span>})
</code></pre>

<p>Or, to answer the original question:</p>

<pre class="lang-py s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-python">age = validate_input(<span class="hljs-string">"Please enter your age: "</span>,
        cast=<span class="hljs-built_in">int</span>, cond=<span class="hljs-keyword">lambda</span> a:<span class="hljs-number">0</span>&lt;=a&lt;<span class="hljs-number">150</span>,

<p>This code uses <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ast.literal_eval()</a> to <strong>find the data type of the input</strong> (<code>age</code>). Then it follows the following algorithm:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>Ask user to input her/his <code>age</code>.</p>
  
  <p>1.1. If <code>age</code> is <code>float</code> or <code>int</code> data type:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Check if <code>age&gt;=18</code>. If <code>age&gt;=18</code>, print appropriate output and exit.</p></li>
  <li><p>Check if <code>0&lt;age&lt;18</code>. If <code>0&lt;age&lt;18</code>, print appropriate output and exit.</p></li>
  <li><p>If <code>age&lt;=0</code>, ask the user to input a valid number for age again, (<em>i.e.</em> go back to step 1.) </p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>1.2. If <code>age</code> is not <code>float</code> or <code>int</code> data type, then ask user to input her/his age again (<em>i.e.</em> go back to step 1.) </p></li>
