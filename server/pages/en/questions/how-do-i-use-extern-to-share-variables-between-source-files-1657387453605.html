(Although there is no need to\ninitialize explicitly to zero, it does no harm and can do some good,\nbecause there can be only one initialized definition of a particular\nglobal variable in a program).\n\nThe source file that defines the variable also includes the header to\nensure that the definition and the declaration are consistent.\n\nA function should never need to declare a variable using extern.\n\nAvoid global variables whenever possible  use functions instead.\n\n\nThe source code and text of this answer are available in my\nSOQ (Stack Overflow Questions)\nrepository on GitHub in the\nsrc/so-0143-3204\nsub-directory.\n\nIf you&apos;re not an experienced C programmer, you could (and perhaps\nshould) stop reading here.\n\nNot so good way to define global variables\nWith some (indeed, many) C compilers, you can get away with what&apos;s\ncalled a &apos;common&apos; definition of a variable too.\n&apos;Common&apos;, here, refers to a technique used in Fortran for sharing\nvariables between source files, using a (possibly named) COMMON block.\nWhat happens here is that each of a number of files provides a tentative\ndefinition of the variable.\nAs long as no more than one file provides an initialized definition,\nthen the various files end up sharing a common single definition of the\nvariable:\nfile10.c\n#include &quot;prog2.h&quot;\n\nlong l;   /* Do not do this in portable code */\n\nvoid inc(void) { l++; }\n\nfile11.c\n#include &quot;prog2.h&quot;\n\nlong l;   /* Do not do this in portable code */\n\nvoid dec(void) { l--; }\n\nfile12.c\n#include &quot;prog2.h&quot;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nlong l = 9;   /* Do not do this in portable code */\n\nvoid put(void) { printf(&quot;l = %ld\\n&quot;, l); }\n\nThis technique does not conform to the letter of the C standard and the\n&apos;one definition rule&apos;  it is officially undefined behaviour:\n\nJ.2 Undefined behavior\n\n\nAn identifier with external linkage is used, but in the program there\ndoes not exist exactly one external definition for the identifier, or\nthe identifier is not used and there exist multiple external\ndefinitions for the identifier (6.9).\n\n\n§6.9 External definitions ¶5\n\n\nAn external definition is an external declaration that is also a\ndefinition of a function (other than an inline definition) or an\nobject.\nIf an identifier declared with external linkage is used in an\nexpression (other than as part of the operand of a sizeof or\n_Alignof operator whose result is an integer constant), somewhere in\nthe entire program there shall be exactly one external definition for\nthe identifier; otherwise, there shall be no more than\none.161)\n\n\n161) Thus, if an identifier declared with external linkage\nis not used in an expression, there need be no external definition for\nit.\n\nHowever, the C standard also lists it in informative Annex J as one of\nthe Common extensions.\n\nJ.5.11 Multiple external definitions\n\n\nThere may be more than one external definition for the identifier of\nan object, with or without the explicit use of the keyword extern; if\nthe definitions disagree, or more than one is initialized, the\nbehavior is undefined (6.9.2).\n\nBecause this technique is not always supported, it is best to avoid\nusing it, especially if your code needs to be portable.\nUsing this technique, you can also end up with unintentional type\npunning.\nIf one of the files above declared l as a double instead of as a\nlong, C&apos;s type-unsafe linkers probably would not spot the mismatch.\nIf you&apos;re on a machine with 64-bit long and double, you&apos;d not even\nget a warning; on a machine with 32-bit long and 64-bit double,\nyou&apos;d probably get a warning about the different sizes  the linker\nwould use the largest size, exactly as a Fortran program would take the\nlargest size of any common blocks.\nNote that GCC 10.1.0, which was released on 2020-05-07, changes the\ndefault compilation options to use\n-fno-common, which means\nthat by default, the code above no longer links unless you override the\ndefault with -fcommon (or use attributes, etc  see the link).\n\nThe next two files complete the source for prog2:\nprog2.h\nextern void dec(void);\nextern void put(void);\nextern void inc(void);\n\nprog2.c\n#include &quot;prog2.h&quot;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    inc();\n    put();\n    dec();\n    put();\n    dec();\n    put();\n}\n\n\nprog2 uses prog2.c, file10.c, file11.c, file12.c, prog2.h.\n\n\nWarning\nAs noted in comments here, and as stated in my answer to a similar\nquestion, using multiple\ndefinitions for a global variable leads to undefined behaviour (J.2;\n§6.9), which is the standard&apos;s way of saying &quot;anything could happen&quot;.\nOne of the things that can happen is that the program behaves as you\nexpect; and J.5.11 says, approximately, &quot;you might be lucky more often\nthan you deserve&quot;.\nBut a program that relies on multiple definitions of an extern variable\n with or without the explicit &apos;extern&apos; keyword  is not a strictly\nconforming program and not guaranteed to work everywhere.\nEquivalently: it contains a bug which may or may not show itself.\nViolating the guidelines\nThere are, of course, many ways in which these guidelines can be broken.\nOccasionally, there may be a good reason to break the guidelines, but\nsuch occasions are extremely unusual.\nfaulty_header.h\nint some_var;    /* Do not do this in a header!!! */\n\nNote 1: if the header defines the variable without the extern keyword,\nthen each file that includes the header creates a tentative definition\nof the variable.\nAs noted previously, this will often work, but the C standard does not\nguarantee that it will work.\nbroken_header.h\nint some_var = 13;    /* Only one source file in a program can use this */\n\nNote 2: if the header defines and initializes the variable, then only\none source file in a given program can use the header.\nSince headers are primarily for sharing information, it is a bit silly\nto create one that can only be used once.\nseldom_correct.h\nstatic int hidden_global = 3;   /* Each source file gets its own copy  */\n\nNote 3: if the header defines a static variable (with or without\ninitialization), then each source file ends up with its own private\nversion of the &apos;global&apos; variable.\nIf the variable is actually a complex array, for example, this can lead\nto extreme duplication of code.  It can, very occasionally, be a\nsensible way to achieve some effect, but that is very unusual.\n\nSummary\nUse the header technique I showed first.\nIt works reliably and everywhere.\nNote, in particular, that the header declaring the global_variable is\nincluded in every file that uses it  including the one that defines it.\nThis ensures that everything is self-consistent.\nSimilar concerns arise with declaring and defining functions \nanalogous rules apply.\nBut the question was about variables specifically, so I&apos;ve kept the\nanswer to variables only.\nEnd of Original Answer\nIf you&apos;re not an experienced C programmer, you probably should stop reading here.\n\nLate Major Addition\nAvoiding Code Duplication\nOne concern that is sometimes (and legitimately) raised about the\n&apos;declarations in headers, definitions in source&apos; mechanism described\nhere is that there are two files to be kept synchronized  the header\nand the source.  This is usually followed up with an observation that a\nmacro can be used so that the header serves double duty  normally\ndeclaring the variables, but when a specific macro is set before the\nheader is included, it defines the variables instead.\nAnother concern can be that the variables need to be defined in each of\na number of &apos;main programs&apos;.  This is normally a spurious concern; you\ncan simply introduce a C source file to define the variables and link\nthe object file produced with each of the programs.\nA typical scheme works like this, using the original global variable\nillustrated in file3.h:\nfile3a.h\n#ifdef DEFINE_VARIABLES\n#define EXTERN /* nothing */\n#else\n#define EXTERN extern\n#endif /* DEFINE_VARIABLES */\n\nEXTERN int global_variable;\n\nfile1a.c\n#define DEFINE_VARIABLES\n#include &quot;file3a.h&quot;  /* Variable defined - but not initialized */\n#include &quot;prog3.h&quot;\n\nint increment(void) { return global_variable++; }\n\nfile2a.c\n#include &quot;file3a.h&quot;\n#include &quot;prog3.h&quot;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nvoid use_it(void)\n{\n    printf(&quot;Global variable: %d\\n&quot;, global_variable++);\n}\n\n\nThe next two files complete the source for prog3:\nprog3.h\nextern void use_it(void);\nextern int increment(void);\n\nprog3.c\n#include &quot;file3a.h&quot;\n#include &quot;prog3.h&quot;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    use_it();\n    global_variable += 19;\n    use_it();\n    printf(&quot;Increment: %d\\n&quot;, increment());\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nprog3 uses prog3.c, file1a.c, file2a.c, file3a.h, prog3.h.\n\n\nVariable initialization\nThe problem with this scheme as shown is that it does not provide for\ninitialization of the global variable.  With C99 or C11 and variable argument\nlists for macros, you could define a macro to support initialization too.\n(With C89 and no support for variable argument lists in macros, there is no\neasy way to handle arbitrarily long initializers.)\nfile3b.h\n#ifdef DEFINE_VARIABLES\n#define EXTERN                  /* nothing */\n#define INITIALIZER(...)        = __VA_ARGS__\n#else\n#define EXTERN                  extern\n#define INITIALIZER(...)        /* nothing */\n#endif /* DEFINE_VARIABLES */\n\nEXTERN int global_variable INITIALIZER(37);\nEXTERN struct { int a; int b; } oddball_struct INITIALIZER({ 41, 43 });\n\nReverse contents of #if and #else blocks, fixing bug identified by\nDenis Kniazhev\nfile1b.c\n#define DEFINE_VARIABLES\n#include &quot;file3b.h&quot;  /* Variables now defined and initialized */\n#include &quot;prog4.h&quot;\n\nint increment(void) { return global_variable++; }\nint oddball_value(void) { return oddball_struct.a + oddball_struct.b; }\n\n\nfile2b.c\n#include &quot;file3b.h&quot;\n#include &quot;prog4.h&quot;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nvoid use_them(void)\n{\n    printf(&quot;Global variable: %d\\n&quot;, global_variable++);\n    oddball_struct.a += global_variable;\n    oddball_struct.b -= global_variable / 2;\n}\n\nClearly, the code for the oddball structure is not what you&apos;d normally\nwrite, but it illustrates the point.  The first argument to the second\ninvocation of INITIALIZER is { 41 and the remaining argument\n(singular in this example) is 43 }.  Without C99 or similar support\nfor variable argument lists for macros, initializers that need to\ncontain commas are very problematic.\nCorrect header file3b.h included (instead of fileba.h) per\nDenis Kniazhev\n\nThe next two files complete the source for prog4:\nprog4.h\nextern int increment(void);\nextern int oddball_value(void);\nextern void use_them(void);\n\nprog4.c\n#include &quot;file3b.h&quot;\n#include &quot;prog4.h&quot;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    use_them();\n    global_variable += 19;\n    use_them();\n    printf(&quot;Increment: %d\\n&quot;, increment());\n    printf(&quot;Oddball:   %d\\n&quot;, oddball_value());\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nprog4 uses prog4.c, file1b.c, file2b.c, prog4.h, file3b.h.\n\n\nHeader Guards\nAny header should be protected against reinclusion, so that type\ndefinitions (enum, struct or union types, or typedefs generally) do not\ncause problems.  The standard technique is to wrap the body of the\nheader in a header guard such as:\n#ifndef FILE3B_H_INCLUDED\n#define FILE3B_H_INCLUDED\n\n...contents of header...\n\n#endif /* FILE3B_H_INCLUDED */\n\nThe header might be included twice indirectly.  For example, if\nfile4b.h includes file3b.h for a type definition that isn&apos;t shown,\nand file1b.c needs to use both header file4b.h and file3b.h, then\nyou have some more tricky issues to resolve.  Clearly, you might revise\nthe header list to include just file4b.h.  However, you might not be\naware of the internal dependencies  and the code should, ideally,\ncontinue to work.\nFurther, it starts to get tricky because you might include file4b.h\nbefore including file3b.h to generate the definitions, but the normal\nheader guards on file3b.h would prevent the header being reincluded.\nSo, you need to include the body of file3b.h at most once for\ndeclarations, and at most once for definitions, but you might need both\nin a single translation unit (TU  a combination of a source file and\nthe headers it uses).\nMultiple inclusion with variable definitions\nHowever, it can be done subject to a not too unreasonable constraint.\nLet&apos;s introduce a new set of file names:\n\nexternal.h for the EXTERN macro definitions, etc.\n\nfile1c.h to define types (notably, struct oddball, the type of oddball_struct).\n\nfile2c.h to define or declare the global variables.\n\nfile3c.c which defines the global variables.\n\nfile4c.c which simply uses the global variables.\n\nfile5c.c which shows that you can declare and then define the global variables.\n\nfile6c.c which shows that you can define and then (attempt to) declare the global variables.\n\n\nIn these examples, file5c.c and file6c.c directly include the header\nfile2c.h several times, but that is the simplest way to show that the\nmechanism works.  It means that if the header was indirectly included\ntwice, it would also be safe.\nThe restrictions for this to work are:\n\nThe header defining or declaring the global variables may not itself\ndefine any types.\n\nImmediately before you include a header that should define variables,\nyou define the macro DEFINE_VARIABLES.\n\nThe header defining or declaring the variables has stylized contents.\n\n\nexternal.h\n/*\n** This header must not contain header guards (like &lt;assert.h&gt; must not).\n** Each time it is invoked, it redefines the macros EXTERN, INITIALIZE\n** based on whether macro DEFINE_VARIABLES is currently defined.\n*/\n#undef EXTERN\n#undef INITIALIZE\n\n#ifdef DEFINE_VARIABLES\n#define EXTERN              /* nothing */\n#define INITIALIZE(...)     = __VA_ARGS__\n#else\n#define EXTERN              extern\n#define INITIALIZE(...)     /* nothing */\n#endif /* DEFINE_VARIABLES */\n\nfile1c.h\n#ifndef FILE1C_H_INCLUDED\n#define FILE1C_H_INCLUDED\n\nstruct oddball\n{\n    int a;\n    int b;\n};\n\nextern void use_them(void);\nextern int increment(void);\nextern int oddball_value(void);\n\n#endif /* FILE1C_H_INCLUDED */\n\n\nfile2c.h\n\n/* Standard prologue */\n#if defined(DEFINE_VARIABLES) &amp;&amp; !defined(FILE2C_H_DEFINITIONS)\n#undef FILE2C_H_INCLUDED\n#endif\n\n#ifndef FILE2C_H_INCLUDED\n#define FILE2C_H_INCLUDED\n\n#include &quot;external.h&quot;   /* Support macros EXTERN, INITIALIZE */\n#include &quot;file1c.h&quot;     /* Type definition for struct oddball */\n\n#if !defined(DEFINE_VARIABLES) || !defined(FILE2C_H_DEFINITIONS)\n\n/* Global variable declarations / definitions */\nEXTERN int global_variable INITIALIZE(37);\nEXTERN struct oddball oddball_struct INITIALIZE({ 41, 43 });\n\n#endif /* !DEFINE_VARIABLES || !FILE2C_H_DEFINITIONS */\n\n/* Standard epilogue */\n#ifdef DEFINE_VARIABLES\n#define FILE2C_H_DEFINITIONS\n#endif /* DEFINE_VARIABLES */\n\n#endif /* FILE2C_H_INCLUDED */\n\nfile3c.c\n#define DEFINE_VARIABLES\n#include &quot;file2c.h&quot;  /* Variables now defined and initialized */\n\nint increment(void) { return global_variable++; }\nint oddball_value(void) { return oddball_struct.a + oddball_struct.b; }\n\n\nfile4c.c\n#include &quot;file2c.h&quot;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nvoid use_them(void)\n{\n    printf(&quot;Global variable: %d\\n&quot;, global_variable++);\n    oddball_struct.a += global_variable;\n    oddball_struct.b -= global_variable / 2;\n}\n\n\nfile5c.c\n\n#include &quot;file2c.h&quot;     /* Declare variables */\n\n#define DEFINE_VARIABLES\n#include &quot;file2c.h&quot;  /* Variables now defined and initialized */\n\nint increment(void) { return global_variable++; }\nint oddball_value(void) { return oddball_struct.a + oddball_struct.b; }\n\n\nfile6c.c\n\n#define DEFINE_VARIABLES\n#include &quot;file2c.h&quot;     /* Variables now defined and initialized */\n\n#include &quot;file2c.h&quot;     /* Declare variables */\n\nint increment(void) { return global_variable++; }\nint oddball_value(void) { return oddball_struct.a + oddball_struct.b; }\n\n\n\nThe next source file completes the source (provides a main program) for prog5, prog6 and prog7:\nprog5.c\n#include &quot;file2c.h&quot;\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    use_them();\n    global_variable += 19;\n    use_them();\n    printf(&quot;Increment: %d\\n&quot;, increment());\n    printf(&quot;Oddball:   %d\\n&quot;, oddball_value());\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nprog5 uses prog5.c, file3c.c, file4c.c, file1c.h, file2c.h, external.h.\n\nprog6 uses prog5.c, file5c.c, file4c.c, file1c.h, file2c.h, external.h.\n\nprog7 uses prog5.c, file6c.c, file4c.c, file1c.h, file2c.h, external.h.\n\n\n\nThis scheme avoids most problems.  You only run into a problem if a\nheader that defines variables (such as file2c.h) is included by\nanother header (say file7c.h) that defines variables.  There isn&apos;t an\neasy way around that other than &quot;don&apos;t do it&quot;.\nYou can partially work around the problem by revising file2c.h into\nfile2d.h:\nfile2d.h\n/* Standard prologue */\n#if defined(DEFINE_VARIABLES) &amp;&amp; !defined(FILE2D_H_DEFINITIONS)\n#undef FILE2D_H_INCLUDED\n#endif\n\n#ifndef FILE2D_H_INCLUDED\n#define FILE2D_H_INCLUDED\n\n#include &quot;external.h&quot;   /* Support macros EXTERN, INITIALIZE */\n#include &quot;file1c.h&quot;     /* Type definition for struct oddball */\n\n#if !defined(DEFINE_VARIABLES) || !defined(FILE2D_H_DEFINITIONS)\n\n/* Global variable declarations / definitions */\nEXTERN int global_variable INITIALIZE(37);\nEXTERN struct oddball oddball_struct INITIALIZE({ 41, 43 });\n\n#endif /* !DEFINE_VARIABLES || !FILE2D_H_DEFINITIONS */\n\n/* Standard epilogue */\n#ifdef DEFINE_VARIABLES\n#define FILE2D_H_DEFINITIONS\n#undef DEFINE_VARIABLES\n#endif /* DEFINE_VARIABLES */\n\n#endif /* FILE2D_H_INCLUDED */\n\nThe issue becomes &apos;should the header include #undef DEFINE_VARIABLES?&apos;\nIf you omit that from the header and wrap any defining invocation with\n#define and #undef:\n#define DEFINE_VARIABLES\n#include &quot;file2c.h&quot;\n#undef DEFINE_VARIABLES\n\nin the source code (so the headers never alter the value of\nDEFINE_VARIABLES), then you should be clean.  It is just a nuisance to\nhave to remember to write the the extra line.

<p>Using <code>extern</code> is only of relevance when the program you're building
consists of multiple source files linked together, where some of the
variables defined, for example, in source file <code>file1.c</code> need to be
referenced in other source files, such as <code>file2.c</code>.</p>
<p>It is important to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1410563">understand the difference between <em>defining</em> a
variable and <em>declaring</em> a
variable</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A variable is <strong>declared</strong> when the compiler is informed that a
variable exists (and this is its type); it does not allocate the
storage for the variable at that point.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A variable is <strong>defined</strong> when the compiler allocates the storage for
the variable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may declare a variable multiple times (though once is sufficient);
you may only define it once within a given scope.
A variable definition is also a declaration, but not all variable
declarations are definitions.</p>
<h2>Best way to declare and define global variables</h2>
<p>The clean, reliable way to declare and define global variables is to use
a header file to contain an <code>extern</code> <em>declaration</em> of the variable.</p>
<p>The header is included by the one source file that defines the variable
and by all the source files that reference the variable.
For each program, one source file (and only one source file) defines the
variable.
Similarly, one header file (and only one header file) should declare the
variable.
The header file is crucial; it enables cross-checking between
independent TUs (translation units  think source files) and ensures
consistency.</p>
<p>Although there are other ways of doing it, this method is simple and
reliable.
It is demonstrated by <code>file3.h</code>, <code>file1.c</code> and <code>file2.c</code>:</p>
<h3>file3.h</h3>

<p><em>The next two files complete the source for <code>prog1</code>:</em></p>
<p>The complete programs shown use functions, so function declarations have
crept in.
Both C99 and C11 require functions to be declared or defined before they
are used (whereas C90 did not, for good reasons).
I use the keyword <code>extern</code> in front of function declarations in headers
for consistency &nbsp;to match the <code>extern</code> in front of variable
declarations in headers.
Many people prefer not to use <code>extern</code> in front of function
declarations; the compiler doesn't care  and ultimately, neither do I

<h2>Not so good way to define global variables</h2>
<p>With some (indeed, many) C compilers, you can get away with what's
called a 'common' definition of a variable too.
'Common', here, refers to a technique used in Fortran for sharing
variables between source files, using a (possibly named) COMMON block.
What happens here is that each of a number of files provides a tentative
definition of the variable.
As long as no more than one file provides an initialized definition,
then the various files end up sharing a common single definition of the
variable:</p>

<p>This technique does not conform to the letter of the C standard and the
'one definition rule'  it is officially undefined behaviour:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://port70.net/%7Ensz/c/c11/n1570.html#J.2" rel="noreferrer">J.2 Undefined behavior</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An identifier with external linkage is used, but in the program there
does not exist exactly one external definition for the identifier, or
the identifier is not used and there exist multiple external
definitions for the identifier (6.9).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://port70.net/%7Ensz/c/c11/n1570.html#6.9p5" rel="noreferrer">§6.9 External definitions ¶5</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>An <em>external definition</em> is an external declaration that is also a
definition of a function (other than an inline definition) or an
object.
If an identifier declared with external linkage is used in an
expression (other than as part of the operand of a <code>sizeof</code> or
<code>_Alignof</code> operator whose result is an integer constant), somewhere in
the entire program there shall be exactly one external definition for
the identifier; otherwise, there shall be no more than
one.<sup>161)</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><sup>161)</sup> Thus, if an identifier declared with external linkage
is not used in an expression, there need be no external definition for
it.</p>

<p>However, the C standard also lists it in informative Annex J as one of

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://port70.net/%7Ensz/c/c11/n1570.html#J.5.11" rel="noreferrer">J.5.11 Multiple external definitions</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There may be more than one external definition for the identifier of
an object, with or without the explicit use of the keyword extern; if
the definitions disagree, or more than one is initialized, the
behavior is undefined (6.9.2).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because this technique is not always supported, it is best to avoid
using it, <em>especially if your code needs to be portable</em>.
Using this technique, you can also end up with unintentional type
punning.</p>
<p>If one of the files above declared <code>l</code> as a <code>double</code> instead of as a
<code>long</code>, C's type-unsafe linkers probably would not spot the mismatch.
If you're on a machine with 64-bit <code>long</code> and <code>double</code>, you'd not even
get a warning; on a machine with 32-bit <code>long</code> and 64-bit <code>double</code>,
you'd probably get a warning about the different sizes  the linker
would use the largest size, exactly as a Fortran program would take the
largest size of any common blocks.</p>
<p>Note that GCC 10.1.0, which was released on 2020-05-07, changes the
default compilation options to use
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/porting_to.html" rel="noreferrer"><code>-fno-common</code></a>, which means
that by default, the code above no longer links unless you override the
default with <code>-fcommon</code> (or use attributes, etc  see the link).</p>

<h3>Warning</h3>
<p>As noted in comments here, and as stated in my answer to a similar
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1490693">question</a>, using multiple
definitions for a global variable leads to undefined behaviour (J.2;
§6.9), which is the standard's way of saying "anything could happen".
One of the things that can happen is that the program behaves as you
expect; and J.5.11 says, approximately, "you might be lucky more often
than you deserve".
But a program that relies on multiple definitions of an extern variable
 with or without the explicit 'extern' keyword  is not a strictly
conforming program and not guaranteed to work everywhere.
Equivalently: it contains a bug which may or may not show itself.</p>
<h2>Violating the guidelines</h2>
<p>There are, of course, many ways in which these guidelines can be broken.
Occasionally, there may be a good reason to break the guidelines, but
such occasions are extremely unusual.</p>
<h3>faulty_header.h</h3>
<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> some_var;    <span class="hljs-comment">/* Do not do this in a header!!! */</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Note 1: if the header defines the variable without the <code>extern</code> keyword,
then each file that includes the header creates a tentative definition
of the variable.
As noted previously, this will often work, but the C standard does not
guarantee that it will work.</p>
<h3>broken_header.h</h3>
<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> some_var = <span class="hljs-number">13</span>;    <span class="hljs-comment">/* Only one source file in a program can use this */</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Note 2: if the header defines and initializes the variable, then only
one source file in a given program can use the header.
Since headers are primarily for sharing information, it is a bit silly
to create one that can only be used once.</p>
<h3>seldom_correct.h</h3>
<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-type">static</span> <span class="hljs-type">int</span> hidden_global = <span class="hljs-number">3</span>;   <span class="hljs-comment">/* Each source file gets its own copy  */</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Note 3: if the header defines a static variable (with or without
initialization), then each source file ends up with its own private
version of the 'global' variable.</p>
<p>If the variable is actually a complex array, for example, this can lead
to extreme duplication of code.  It can, very occasionally, be a
sensible way to achieve some effect, but that is very unusual.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Use the header technique I showed first.
It works reliably and everywhere.
Note, in particular, that the header declaring the <code>global_variable</code> is
included in every file that uses it  including the one that defines it.
This ensures that everything is self-consistent.</p>
<p>Similar concerns arise with declaring and defining functions 
analogous rules apply.
But the question was about variables specifically, so I've kept the
answer to variables only.</p>

<p><em>Late Major Addition</em></p>
<h1>Avoiding Code Duplication</h1>
<p>One concern that is sometimes (and legitimately) raised about the
'declarations in headers, definitions in source' mechanism described
here is that there are two files to be kept synchronized  the header
and the source.  This is usually followed up with an observation that a
macro can be used so that the header serves double duty  normally
declaring the variables, but when a specific macro is set before the
header is included, it defines the variables instead.</p>
<p>Another concern can be that the variables need to be defined in each of
a number of 'main programs'.  This is normally a spurious concern; you
can simply introduce a C source file to define the variables and link
the object file produced with each of the programs.</p>
<p>A typical scheme works like this, using the original global variable
illustrated in <code>file3.h</code>:</p>

<h2>Variable initialization</h2>
<p>The problem with this scheme as shown is that it does not provide for
initialization of the global variable.  With C99 or C11 and variable argument
lists for macros, you could define a macro to support initialization too.
(With C89 and no support for variable argument lists in macros, there is no
easy way to handle arbitrarily long initializers.)</p>

<p>Clearly, the code for the oddball structure is not what you'd normally
write, but it illustrates the point.  The first argument to the second
invocation of <code>INITIALIZER</code> is <code>{ 41</code> and the remaining argument
(singular in this example) is <code>43 }</code>.  Without C99 or similar support
for variable argument lists for macros, initializers that need to
contain commas are very problematic.</p>

<h2>Header Guards</h2>
<p>Any header should be protected against reinclusion, so that type
definitions (enum, struct or union types, or typedefs generally) do not
cause problems.  The standard technique is to wrap the body of the
header in a header guard such as:</p>
<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-keyword">ifndef</span> FILE3B_H_INCLUDED</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-keyword">define</span> FILE3B_H_INCLUDED</span>

...contents of header...

<span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-keyword">endif</span> <span class="hljs-comment">/* FILE3B_H_INCLUDED */</span></span>
</code></pre>
<p>The header might be included twice indirectly.  For example, if
<code>file4b.h</code> includes <code>file3b.h</code> for a type definition that isn't shown,
and <code>file1b.c</code> needs to use both header <code>file4b.h</code> and <code>file3b.h</code>, then
you have some more tricky issues to resolve.  Clearly, you might revise
the header list to include just <code>file4b.h</code>.  However, you might not be
aware of the internal dependencies  and the code should, ideally,
continue to work.</p>
<p>Further, it starts to get tricky because you might include <code>file4b.h</code>
before including <code>file3b.h</code> to generate the definitions, but the normal
header guards on <code>file3b.h</code> would prevent the header being reincluded.</p>
<p>So, you need to include the body of <code>file3b.h</code> at most once for
declarations, and at most once for definitions, but you might need both
in a single translation unit (TU  a combination of a source file and
the headers it uses).</p>
<h2>Multiple inclusion with variable definitions</h2>
<p>However, it can be done subject to a not too unreasonable constraint.
Let's introduce a new set of file names:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>external.h</code> for the EXTERN macro definitions, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>file1c.h</code> to define types (notably, <code>struct oddball</code>, the type of <code>oddball_struct</code>).</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>file2c.h</code> to define or declare the global variables.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>file3c.c</code> which defines the global variables.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>file4c.c</code> which simply uses the global variables.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>file5c.c</code> which shows that you can declare and then define the global variables.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>file6c.c</code> which shows that you can define and then (attempt to) declare the global variables.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In these examples, <code>file5c.c</code> and <code>file6c.c</code> directly include the header
<code>file2c.h</code> several times, but that is the simplest way to show that the
mechanism works.  It means that if the header was indirectly included
twice, it would also be safe.</p>
<p>The restrictions for this to work are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The header defining or declaring the global variables may not itself
define any types.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Immediately before you include a header that should define variables,
you define the macro DEFINE_VARIABLES.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The header defining or declaring the variables has stylized contents.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>However, the problems are relatively unlikely to occur in practice,
especially if you take the standard advice to</p>
<h1>Avoid global variables</h1>
<hr>
<p>Does this exposition miss anything?</p>
<sup>
_Confession_: The 'avoiding duplicated code' scheme outlined here was
developed because the issue affects some code I work on (but don't own),
and is a niggling concern with the scheme outlined in the first part of
the answer.  However, the original scheme leaves you with just two
places to modify to keep variable definitions and declarations
synchronized, which is a big step forward over having exernal variable
declarations scattered throughout the code base (which really matters
when there are thousands of files in total).  However, the code in the
files with the names `fileNc.[ch]` (plus `external.h` and `externdef.h`)
shows that it can be made to work.  Clearly, it would not be hard to
create a header generator script to give you the standardized template
for a variable defining and declaring header file.
</sup>
<p><em>NB</em> These are toy programs with just barely enough code to make them
marginally interesting.  There is repetition within the examples that
could be removed, but isn't to simplify the pedagogical explanation.
(For example: the difference between <code>prog5.c</code> and <code>prog8.c</code> is the name
of one of the headers that are included.  It would be possible to
reorganize the code so that the <code>main()</code> function was not repeated, but
it would conceal more than it revealed.)</p>

<p>extern tells the compiler to trust you that the memory for this variable is declared elsewhere, so it doesnt try to allocate/check memory.  </p>

<p>In C a variable inside a file say example.c is given local scope. The compiler expects that the variable would have its definition inside the same file example.c and when it does not find the same , it would throw an error.A function on the other hand has by default global scope . Thus you do not have to explicitly mention to the compiler "look dude...you might find the definition of this function here". For a function including the file which contains its declaration is enough.(The file which you actually call a header file). 
   For example consider the following 2 files :<br>
 example.c </p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-keyword">include</span><span class="hljs-string">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></span>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> a = <span class="hljs-number">5</span>;

<p>Now when you compile the two files together, using the following commands :</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.sco.com/developers/gabi/2003-12-17/contents.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">System V ABI Update ELF spec</a> "Symbol Table" chapter explains:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SHN_UNDEF This section table index means the symbol is undefined. When the link editor combines this object file with another that defines the indicated symbol, this file's references to the symbol will be linked to the actual definition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which is basically the behavior the C standard gives to <code>extern</code> variables.</p>

<p>From now on, it is the job of the linker to make the final program, but the <code>extern</code> information has already been extracted from the source code into the object file.</p>

<p><strong>C++17 inline variables</strong></p>

<p>In C++17, you might want to use inline variables instead of extern ones, as they are simple to use (can be defined just once on header) and more powerful (support constexpr). See: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/177437/what-does-const-static-mean-in-c-and-c/53883715#53883715">What does 'const static' mean in C and C++?</a></p>

<p><code>extern</code>
allows one module of your program to access a global variable or function declared in another module of your program.
You usually have extern variables declared in header files.</p>

<p>If you don't want a program to access your variables or functions, you use <code>static</code> which tells the compiler that this variable or function cannot be used outside of this module.</p>

<p>First off, the <code>extern</code> keyword is not used for defining a variable; rather it is used for declaring a variable. I can say <code>extern</code> is a storage class, not a data type.</p>

<p><code>extern</code> is used to let other C files or external components know this variable is already defined somewhere. Example: if  you are building a library, no need to define global variable mandatorily somewhere in library itself. The library will be compiled directly, but while linking the file, it checks for the definition.</p>

<p>With xc8 you have to be careful about declaring a variable
as the same type in each file as you could , erroneously,
declare something an <code>int</code> in one file and a <code>char</code> say in another.
This could lead to corruption of variables.</p>

<p>This problem was elegantly solved in a microchip forum some 15 years ago
    /* See "http:www.htsoft.com"                                          <em>/
    /</em>  "forum/all/showflat.php/Cat/0/Number/18766/an/0/page/0#18766" </p>

<p>But this link seems to no longer work...</p>

<p>So I;ll quickly try to explain it;
make a file called global.h.</p>

<p>In it declare the following</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-keyword">ifdef</span> MAIN_C</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-keyword">define</span> GLOBAL</span>
 <span class="hljs-comment">/* #warning COMPILING MAIN.C */</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span></span>
<span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-keyword">define</span> GLOBAL extern</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-keyword">endif</span></span>
GLOBAL <span class="hljs-type">unsigned</span> <span class="hljs-type">char</span> testing_mode; <span class="hljs-comment">// example var used in several C files</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Now in the file main.c</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-keyword">define</span> MAIN_C 1</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-keyword">include</span> <span class="hljs-string">"global.h"</span></span>
<span class="hljs-meta">#<span class="hljs-keyword">undef</span> MAIN_C</span>
</code></pre>

<p>This means in main.c the variable will be declared as an <code>unsigned char</code>.</p>

<p>Now in other files simply including global.h will
have it declared as an extern <em>for that file</em>.</p>

<pre class="lang-c s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-c"><span class="hljs-keyword">extern</span> <span class="hljs-type">unsigned</span> <span class="hljs-type">char</span> testing_mode;
</code></pre>

<p>But it will be correctly declared as an <code>unsigned char</code>.</p>

<p>The old forum post probably explained this a bit more clearly.
But this is a real potential <code>gotcha</code> when using a compiler
that allows you to declare a variable in one file and then declare it extern as a different type in another. The problems associated with
that are if you say declared testing_mode as an int in another file
it would think it was a 16 bit var and overwrite some other part of ram, potentially corrupting another variable. Difficult to debug!</p>

<p>A very short solution I use to allow a header file to contain the extern reference or actual implementation of an object. The file that actually contains the object just does <code>#define GLOBAL_FOO_IMPLEMENTATION</code>. Then when I add a new object to this file it shows up in that file also without me having to copy and paste the definition.</p>

<p>I use this pattern across multiple files. So in order to keep things as self contained as possible, I just reuse the single GLOBAL macro in each header. My header looks like this:</p>

<p>In short <code>extern</code> means that variable is defined in other module and its address will be known at link time. The compiler does not reserve memory in current module and knows the variable type. To understand <code>extern</code> is good to have at least little experience with assembler.</p>

However, the original scheme leaves you with just two\nplaces to modify to keep variable definitions and declarations\nsynchronized, which is a big step forward over having exernal variable\ndeclarations scattered throughout the code base (which really matters\nwhen there are thousands of files in total).  However, the code in the\nfiles with the names `fileNc.[ch]` (plus `external.h` and `externdef.h`)\nshows that it can be made to work.  Clearly, it would not be hard to\ncreate a header generator script to give you the standardized template\nfor a variable defining and declaring header file.\n\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;NB\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; These are toy programs with just barely enough code to make them\nmarginally interesting.

when using a compiler\nthat allows you to declare a variable in one file and then declare it extern as a different type in another.
