They only explain the benign cases of slicing, not the treacherous ones. Assume, like the other answers, that you&apos;re dealing with two classes A and B, where B derives (publicly) from A.\n\nIn this situation, C++ lets you pass an instance of B to  A&apos;s assignment operator (and also to the copy constructor). This works because an instance of B can be converted to a const A&amp;, which is what assignment operators and copy-constructors expect their arguments to be.\n\nThe benign case\n\nB b;\nA a = b;\n\n\nNothing bad happens there - you asked for an instance of A which is a copy of B, and that&apos;s exactly what you get. Sure, a won&apos;t contain some of b&apos;s members, but how should it? It&apos;s an A, after all, not a B, so it hasn&apos;t even heard about these members, let alone would be able to store them.\n\nThe treacherous case\n\nB b1;\nB b2;\nA&amp; a_ref = b2;\na_ref = b1;\n//b2 now contains a mixture of b1 and b2!\n\n\nYou might think that b2 will be a copy of b1 afterward. But, alas, it&apos;s not! If you inspect it, you&apos;ll discover that b2 is a Frankensteinian creature, made from some chunks of b1 (the chunks that B inherits from A), and some chunks of b2 (the chunks that only B contains). Ouch!\n\nWhat happened? Well, C++ by default doesn&apos;t treat assignment operators as virtual. Thus, the line a_ref = b1 will call the assignment operator of A, not that of B. This is because, for non-virtual functions, the declared (formally: static) type (which is A&amp;) determines which function is called, as opposed to the actual (formally: dynamic) type (which would be B, since a_ref references an instance of B). Now, A&apos;s assignment operator obviously knows only about the members declared in A, so it will copy only those, leaving the members added in B unchanged.\n\nA solution\n\nAssigning only to parts of an object usually makes little sense, yet C++, unfortunately, provides no built-in way to forbid this. You can, however, roll your own. The first step is making the assignment operator virtual. This will guarantee that it&apos;s always the actual type&apos;s assignment operator which is called, not the declared type&apos;s. The second step is to use dynamic_cast to verify that the assigned object has a compatible type. The third step is to do the actual assignment in a (protected!) member assign(), since B&apos;s assign() will probably want to use A&apos;s assign() to copy A&apos;s, members.\n\nclass A {\npublic:\n  virtual A&amp; operator= (const A&amp; a) {\n    assign(a);\n    return *this;\n  }\n\nprotected:\n  void assign(const A&amp; a) {\n    // copy members of A from a to this\n  }\n};\n\nclass B : public A {\npublic:\n  virtual B&amp; operator= (const A&amp; a) {\n    if (const B* b = dynamic_cast&lt;const B*&gt;(&amp;a))\n      assign(*b);\n    else\n      throw bad_assignment();\n    return *this;\n  }\n\nprotected:\n  void assign(const B&amp; b) {\n    A::assign(b); // Let A&apos;s assign() copy members of A from b to this\n    // copy members of B from b to this\n  }\n};\n\n\nNote that, for pure convenience, B&apos;s operator= covariantly overrides the return type, since it knows that it&apos;s returning an instance of B.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"If You have a base class A and a derived class B, then You can do the following.\n\nvoid wantAnA(A myA)\n{\n   // work with myA\n}\n\nB derived;\n// work with the object &quot;derived&quot;\nwantAnA(derived);\n\n\nNow the method wantAnA needs a copy of derived.

Dealing with slicing is #54.\n\nIt suggests a somewhat sophisticated pattern to fully deal with the issue:  have a protected copy constructor, a protected pure virtual DoClone, and a public Clone with an assert which will tell you if a (further) derived class failed to implement DoClone correctly.  (The Clone method makes a proper deep copy of the polymorphic object.)\n\nYou can also mark the copy constructor on the base explicit which allows for explicit slicing if it is desired.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution9","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"The slicing problem in C++ arises from the value semantics of its objects, which remained mostly due to compatibility with C structs. You need to use explicit reference or pointer syntax to achieve &quot;normal&quot; object behavior found in most other languages that do objects, i.e., objects are always passed around by reference.\n\nThe short answers is that you slice the object by assigning a derived object to a base object by value, i.e. the remaining object is only a part of the derived object. In order to preserve value semantics, slicing is a reasonable behavior and has its relatively rare uses, which doesn&apos;t exist in most other languages.

A control center UI for example.\nThis UI needs to get a list of things that are currently able to be dispatched. So we define a class that contains the dispatch-information. Let&apos;s call it Action. So an Action has some member variables. For simplicity we just have 2, being a std::string name and a std::function&lt;void()&gt; f. Then it has an void activate() which just executes the f member.\n\nSo the UI gets a std::vector&lt;Action&gt; supplied. Imagine some functions like:\n\nvoid push_back(Action toAdd);\n\n\n\n\nNow we have established how it looks from the UI&apos;s perspective. No problem so far. But some other guy who works on this project suddenly decides that there are specialized actions that need more information in the Action object. For what reason ever. That could also be solved with lambda captures.  This example is not taken 1-1 from the code.\n\nSo the guy derives from Action to add his own flavour.\nHe passes an instance of his home-brewed class to the push_back but then the program goes haywire.\n\nSo what happened?\nAs you might have guessed: the object has been sliced.\n\nThe extra information from the instance has been lost, and f is now prone to undefined behaviour.\n\n\n\nI hope

<p>"Slicing" is where you assign an object of a derived class to an instance of a base class, thereby losing part of the information - some of it is "sliced" away.</p>

<p>For example, </p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">A</span> {
   <span class="hljs-type">int</span> foo;
};

<span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">B</span> : <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> A {
   <span class="hljs-type">int</span> bar;
};
</code></pre>

<p>So an object of type <code>B</code> has two data members, <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>.</p>

<p>Then if you were to write this:</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp">B b;

A a = b;
</code></pre>

<p>Then the information in <code>b</code> about member <code>bar</code> is lost in <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>Most answers here fail to explain what the actual problem with slicing is. They only explain the benign cases of slicing, not the treacherous ones. Assume, like the other answers, that you're dealing with two classes <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, where <code>B</code> derives (publicly) from <code>A</code>.</p>

<p>In this situation, C++ lets you pass an instance of <code>B</code> to  <code>A</code>'s assignment operator (and also to the copy constructor). This works because an instance of <code>B</code> can be converted to a <code>const A&amp;</code>, which is what assignment operators and copy-constructors expect their arguments to be.</p>

<h3>The benign case</h3>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp">B b;
A a = b;
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing bad happens there - you asked for an instance of <code>A</code> which is a copy of <code>B</code>, and that's exactly what you get. Sure, <code>a</code> won't contain some of <code>b</code>'s members, but how should it? It's an <code>A</code>, after all, not a <code>B</code>, so it hasn't even <em>heard</em> about these members, let alone would be able to store them.</p>

<h3>The treacherous case</h3>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp">B b1;
B b2;
A&amp; a_ref = b2;
a_ref = b1;
<span class="hljs-comment">//b2 now contains a mixture of b1 and b2!</span>
</code></pre>

<p>You might think that <code>b2</code> will be a copy of <code>b1</code> afterward. But, alas, it's <strong>not</strong>! If you inspect it, you'll discover that <code>b2</code> is a Frankensteinian creature, made from some chunks of <code>b1</code> (the chunks that <code>B</code> inherits from <code>A</code>), and some chunks of <code>b2</code> (the chunks that only <code>B</code> contains). Ouch!</p>

<p>What happened? Well, C++ by default doesn't treat assignment operators as <code>virtual</code>. Thus, the line <code>a_ref = b1</code> will call the assignment operator of <code>A</code>, not that of <code>B</code>. This is because, for non-virtual functions, the <strong>declared</strong> (formally: <em>static</em>) type (which is <code>A&amp;</code>) determines which function is called, as opposed to the <strong>actual</strong> (formally: <em>dynamic</em>) type (which would be <code>B</code>, since <code>a_ref</code> references an instance of <code>B</code>). Now, <code>A</code>'s assignment operator obviously knows only about the members declared in <code>A</code>, so it will copy only those, leaving the members added in <code>B</code> unchanged.</p>

<h3>A solution</h3>

<p>Assigning only to parts of an object usually makes little sense, yet C++, unfortunately, provides no built-in way to forbid this. You can, however, roll your own. The first step is making the assignment operator <em>virtual</em>. This will guarantee that it's always the <strong>actual</strong> type's assignment operator which is called, not the <strong>declared</strong> type's. The second step is to use <code>dynamic_cast</code> to verify that the assigned object has a compatible type. The third step is to do the actual assignment in a (protected!) member <code>assign()</code>, since <code>B</code>'s <code>assign()</code> will probably want to use <code>A</code>'s <code>assign()</code> to copy <code>A</code>'s, members.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Note that, for pure convenience, <code>B</code>'s <code>operator=</code> covariantly overrides the return type, since it <strong>knows</strong> that it's returning an instance of <code>B</code>.</p>

<p>Third match in google for "C++ slicing" gives me this Wikipedia article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_slicing" rel="noreferrer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_slicing</a> and this (heated, but the first few posts define the problem) : <a href="http://bytes.com/forum/thread163565.html" rel="noreferrer">http://bytes.com/forum/thread163565.html</a></p>

<p>So it's when you assign an object of a subclass to the super class. The superclass knows nothing of the additional information in the subclass, and hasn't got room to store it, so the additional information gets "sliced off".</p>

<p>The slicing problem is serious because it can result in memory corruption, and it is very difficult to guarantee a program does not suffer from it. To design it out of the language, classes that support inheritance should be accessible by reference only (not by value). The D programming language has this property.</p>

<p>Consider class A, and class B derived from A. Memory corruption can happen if the A part has a pointer p, and a B instance that points p to B's additional data. Then, when the additional data gets sliced off, p is pointing to garbage.</p>

<p>B (object b) is derived from A (object a1 and a2). b and a1, as we expect, call their member function. But from polymorphism viewpoint we dont expect a2, which is assigned by b, to not be overridden. Basically, a2 only saves A-class part of b and that is object slicing in C++.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, a reference or pointer should be used</p>

<p>So ... Why is losing the derived information bad? ... because the author of the derived class may have changed the representation such that slicing off the extra information changes the value being represented by the object.  This can happen if the derived class if used to cache a representation that is more efficient for certain operations, but expensive to transform back to the base representation.</p>

<p>Also thought someone should also mention what you should do to avoid slicing...
Get a copy of C++ Coding Standards, 101 rules guidlines, and best practices.  Dealing with slicing is #54.</p>

<p>It suggests a somewhat sophisticated pattern to fully deal with the issue:  have a protected copy constructor, a protected pure virtual DoClone, and a public Clone with an assert which will tell you if a (further) derived class failed to implement DoClone correctly.  (The Clone method makes a proper deep copy of the polymorphic object.)</p>

<p>You can also mark the copy constructor on the base explicit which allows for explicit slicing if it is desired.</p>

<p>The slicing problem in C++ arises from the value semantics of its objects, which remained mostly due to compatibility with C structs. You need to use explicit reference or pointer syntax to achieve "normal" object behavior found in most other languages that do objects, i.e., objects are always passed around by reference.</p>

<p>The short answers is that you slice the object by assigning a derived object to a base object <em>by value</em>, i.e. the remaining object is only a part of the derived object. In order to preserve value semantics, slicing is a reasonable behavior and has its relatively rare uses, which doesn't exist in most other languages. Some people consider it a feature of C++, while many considered it one of the quirks/misfeatures of C++.</p>

<p><strong>1. THE DEFINITION OF SLICING PROBLEM</strong></p>

<p>If D is a derived class of the base class B, then you can assign an object of type Derived to a variable (or parameter) of type Base. </p>

<p><em>EXAMPLE</em></p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Pet</span>
{
 <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span>:
    string name;
};
<span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Dog</span> : <span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> Pet
{
<span class="hljs-keyword">public</span>:
    string breed;
};

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-type">int</span> <span class="hljs-title">main</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span>
</span>{   
    Dog dog;
    Pet pet;

    dog.name = <span class="hljs-string">"Tommy"</span>;
    dog.breed = <span class="hljs-string">"Kangal Dog"</span>;
    pet = dog;
    cout &lt;&lt; pet.breed; <span class="hljs-comment">//ERROR</span>
</code></pre>

<p>Although the above assignment is allowed, the value that is assigned to the variable pet loses its breed field. This is called the <strong>slicing problem</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>2. HOW TO FIX THE SLICING PROBLEM</strong></p>

<p>To defeat the problem, we use pointers to dynamic variables.</p>

<p><em>EXAMPLE</em></p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp">Pet *ptrP;
Dog *ptrD;
ptrD = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Dog;         
ptrD-&gt;name = <span class="hljs-string">"Tommy"</span>;
ptrD-&gt;breed = <span class="hljs-string">"Kangal Dog"</span>;
ptrP = ptrD;
cout &lt;&lt; ((Dog *)ptrP)-&gt;breed; 
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, none of the data members or member functions of the dynamic variable
being pointed to by ptrD (descendant class object) will be lost. In addition,  if you need to use functions, the function must be a virtual function.</p>

<p>It seems to me, that slicing isn't so much a problem other than when your own classes and program are poorly architected/designed.</p>

<p>If I pass a subclass object in as a parameter to a method, which takes a parameter of type superclass, I should certainly be aware of that and know the internally, the called method will be working with the superclass (aka baseclass) object only.</p>

<p>It seems to me only the unreasonable expectation that providing a subclass where a baseclass is requested, would somehow result in subclass specific results, would cause slicing to be a problem.  Its either poor design in the use of the method or a poor subclass implementation.  I'm guessing its usually the result of sacrificing good OOP design in favor of expediency or performance gains.</p>

<p>Slicing means that the data added by a subclass are discarded when an object of the subclass is passed or returned by value or from a function expecting a base class object.    </p>

<p><strong>Explanation:</strong>
Consider the following class declaration:</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp">           <span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">baseclass</span>

                 <span class="hljs-built_in">baseclass</span>(<span class="hljs-type">const</span> baseclass&amp;);

<p>I just ran across the slicing problem and promptly landed here. So let me add my two cents to this.</p>

<p>Let's have an example from "production code" (or something that comes kind of close):</p>

<hr>

<p>Let's say we have something that dispatches actions. A control center UI for example.<br>
This UI needs to get a list of things that are currently able to be dispatched. So we define a class that contains the dispatch-information. Let's call it <code>Action</code>. So an <code>Action</code> has some member variables. For simplicity we just have 2, being a <code>std::string name</code> and a <code>std::function&lt;void()&gt; f</code>. Then it has an <code>void activate()</code> which just executes the <code>f</code> member.</p>

<p>So the UI gets a <code>std::vector&lt;Action&gt;</code> supplied. Imagine some functions like:</p>

<pre class="lang-cpp s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-cpp"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-type">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">push_back</span><span class="hljs-params">(Action toAdd)</span></span>;
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have established how it looks from the UI's perspective. No problem so far. But some other guy who works on this project suddenly decides that there are specialized actions that need more information in the <code>Action</code> object. For what reason ever. That could also be solved with lambda captures.  This example is not taken 1-1 from the code.</p>

<p>So the guy derives from <code>Action</code> to add his own flavour.<br>
He passes an instance of his home-brewed class to the <code>push_back</code> but then the program goes haywire.</p>

<p>So what happened?<br>
As you <em>might</em> have guessed: the object has been sliced.</p>

<p>The extra information from the instance has been lost, and <code>f</code> is now prone to undefined behaviour.</p>

<hr>

<p>I hope this example brings light about for those people who can't really imagine things when talking about <code>A</code>s and <code>B</code>s being derived in some manner.</p>

But, alas, it\u0026apos;s \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;not\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;! If you inspect it, you\u0026apos;ll discover that \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;b2\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is a Frankensteinian creature, made from some chunks of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;b1\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; (the chunks that \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;B\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; inherits from \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;A\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;), and some chunks of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;b2\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; (the chunks that only \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;B\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; contains). Ouch!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;What happened? Well, C++ by default doesn\u0026apos;t treat assignment operators as \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;virtual\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. Thus, the line \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;a_ref = b1\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; will call the assignment operator of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;A\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, not that of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;B\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. This is because, for non-virtual functions, the \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;declared\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; (formally: \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;static\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;) type (which is \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;A\u0026amp;amp;\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;) determines which function is called, as opposed to the \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;actual\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; (formally: \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;dynamic\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;) type (which would be \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;B\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, since \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;a_ref\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; references an instance of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;B\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;). Now, \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;A\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026apos;s assignment operator obviously knows only about the members declared in \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;A\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, so it will copy only those, leaving the members added in \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;B\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; unchanged.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;A solution\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Assigning only to parts of an object usually makes little sense, yet C++, unfortunately, provides no built-in way to forbid this. You can, however, roll your own. The first step is making the assignment operator \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;virtual\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;. This will guarantee that it\u0026apos;s always the \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;actual\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; type\u0026apos;s assignment operator which is called, not the \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;declared\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; type\u0026apos;s. The second step is to use \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;dynamic_cast\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to verify that the assigned object has a compatible type. The third step is to do the actual assignment in a (protected!) member \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;assign()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, since \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;B\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026apos;s \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;assign()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;

Imagine some functions like:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-cpp s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-cpp\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-function\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-type\u0026quot;\u0026gt;void\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title\u0026quot;\u0026gt;push_back\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-params\u0026quot;\u0026gt;(Action toAdd)\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;;\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now we have established how it looks from the UI\u0026apos;s perspective. No problem so far. But some other guy who works on this project suddenly decides that there are specialized actions that need more information in the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Action\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; object. For what reason ever. That could also be solved with lambda captures.  This example is not taken 1-1 from the code.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So the guy derives from \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Action\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to add his own flavour.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nHe passes an instance of his home-brewed class to the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;push_back\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; but then the program goes haywire.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So what happened?\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nAs you \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;might\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; have guessed: the object has been sliced.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The extra information from the instance has been lost, and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;f\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is now prone to undefined behaviour.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I hope this example brings light about for those people who can\u0026apos;t really imagine things when talking about \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;A\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;s and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;B\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;s being derived in some manner.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    "],"id":78,"title":"What is object slicing?","content":"\n                \n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In c++ what is object slicing and when does it occur?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","slug":"what-is-object-slicing-1657384506425","postType":"QUESTION","createdAt":"2022-07-09T16:35:06.000Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-09T16:35:06.000Z","tags":[{"id":285,"name":"inheritance","slug":"inheritance","createdAt":"2022-07-09T16:35:06.000Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-09T16:35:06.000Z","Questions_Tags":{"questionId":78,"tagId":285}},{"id":286,"name":"object-slicing","slug":"object-slicing","createdAt":"2022-07-09T16:35:06.000Z","updatedAt":"2022-07-09T16:35:06.000Z","Questions_Tags":{"questionId":78,"tagId":286}}],"relatedQuestions":[{"title":"What is object slicing?","slug":"what-is-object-slicing-1657384506425","tags":[{"name":"inheritance","Questions_Tags":{"questionId":78,"tagId":285}},{"name":"object-slicing","Questions_Tags":{"questionId":78,"tagId":286}}]}]},"randomQuestions":[{"title":"Why are floating point numbers inaccurate?","slug":"why-are-floating-point-numbers-inaccurate-1657387346111"},{"title":"Converting string into datetime","slug":"converting-string-into-datetime-1657387717295"},{"title":"What are the rules about using an underscore in a C++ identifier?","slug":"what-are-the-rules-about-using-an-underscore-in-a-c++-identifier-1657384557197"},{"title":"Numbering rows within groups in a data frame","slug":"numbering-rows-within-groups-in-a-data-frame-1657388556436"},{"title":"How to determine equality for two JavaScript objects?","slug":"how-to-determine-equality-for-two-javascript-objects-1657387638650"},{"title":"Why do regex constructors need to be double escaped?","slug":"why-do-regex-constructors-need-to-be-double-escaped-1657388004942"},{"title":"Using fflush(stdin)","slug":"using-fflush(stdin)-1657387602771"},{"title":"How do I revert a Git repository to a previous commit?","slug":"how-do-i-revert-a-git-repository-to-a-previous-commit-1657387714717"},{"title":"How can I group an array of objects by key?","slug":"how-can-i-group-an-array-of-objects-by-key-1657388065372"},{"title":"No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource—when trying to get data from a REST API","slug":"no-'access-control-allow-origin'-header-is-present-on-the-requested-resourcewhen-trying-to-get-data-from-a-rest-api-1657387628467"},{"title":"XMLHttpRequest cannot load XXX No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header","slug":"xmlhttprequest-cannot-load-xxx-no-'access-control-allow-origin'-header-1657384758362"},{"title":"What's the meaning of \"=\u003e\" (an arrow formed from equals \u0026 greater than) in JavaScript?","slug":"what's-the-meaning-of-\"greater\"-(an-arrow-formed-from-equals-and-greater-than)-in-javascript-1657387977118"},{"title":"Add a property to a JavaScript object using a variable as the name?","slug":"add-a-property-to-a-javascript-object-using-a-variable-as-the-name-1657388425650"},{"title":"Why shouldn't I use mysql_* functions in PHP?","slug":"why-shouldn't-i-use-mysql_*-functions-in-php-1657384260352"},{"title":"Why can templates only be implemented in the header file?","slug":"why-can-templates-only-be-implemented-in-the-header-file-1657384341933"},{"title":"Why is my variable unaltered after I modify it inside of a function?
