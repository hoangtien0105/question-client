Reading everything is recommended though as it provides useful background for understanding the &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt; that makes seeing how the &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; applies in different circumstances easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;About the Same Origin Policy&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Same Origin Policy&lt;/a&gt;. It is a security feature implemented by browsers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your particular case is showing how it is implemented for XMLHttpRequest (and you&apos;ll get identical results if you were to use fetch), but it also applies to other things (such as images loaded onto a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;canvas&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; or documents loaded into an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;), just with slightly different implementations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(Weirdly, it also applies to CSS fonts, but that is because found foundries insisted on DRM and not for the security issues that the Same Origin Policy usually covers).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The standard scenario that demonstrates the need for the SOP can be demonstrated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;three characters&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Alice is a person with a web browser&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bob runs a website (&lt;code&gt;https://www.[website].com/&lt;/code&gt; in your example)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mallory runs a website (&lt;code&gt;http://localhost:4300&lt;/code&gt; in your example)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Alice is logged into Bob&apos;s site and has some confidential data there. Perhaps it is a company intranet (accessible only to browsers on the LAN), or her online banking (accessible only with a cookie you get after entering a username and password).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Alice visits Mallory&apos;s website which has some JavaScript that causes Alice&apos;s browser to make an HTTP request to Bob&apos;s website (from her IP address with her cookies, etc). This could be as simple as using &lt;code&gt;XMLHttpRequest&lt;/code&gt; and reading the &lt;code&gt;responseText&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The browser&apos;s Same Origin Policy prevents that JavaScript from reading the data returned by Bob&apos;s website (which Bob and Alice don&apos;t want Mallory to access). (Note that you can, for example, display an image using an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element across origins because the content of the image is not exposed to JavaScript (or Mallory)  unless you throw canvas into the mix in which case you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; generate a same-origin violation error).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Why the Same Origin Policy applies when you don&apos;t think it should&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For any given URL it is possible that the SOP is not needed. A couple of common scenarios where this is the case are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Alice, Bob and Mallory are the same person.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bob is providing entirely public information&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt; but the browser has no way of knowing if either of the above are true, so trust is not automatic and the SOP is applied. Permission has to be granted explicitly before the browser will give the data it was given to a different website.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Why the Same Origin Policy only applies to JavaScript in a web page&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Browser extensions&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, the Network tab in browser developer tools and applications like Postman are installed software. They aren&apos;t passing data from one website to the JavaScript belonging to a different website &lt;em&gt;just because you visited that different website&lt;/em&gt;. Installing software usually takes a more conscious choice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There isn&apos;t a third party (Mallory) who is considered a risk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; Browser extensions do need to be written carefully to avoid cross-origin issues. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/extension-content-script-fetches&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;See the Chrome documentation for example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Why you can display data in the page without reading it with JS&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are a number of circumstances where Mallory&apos;s site can cause a browser to fetch data from a third party and display it (e.g. by adding an &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;img&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element to display an image). It isn&apos;t possible for Mallory&apos;s JavaScript to read the data in that resource though, only Alice&apos;s browser and Bob&apos;s server can do that, so it is still secure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;CORS&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&lt;/code&gt; HTTP &lt;strong&gt;response&lt;/strong&gt; header referred to in the error message is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;CORS&lt;/a&gt; standard which allows Bob to explicitly grant permission to Mallory&apos;s site to access the data via Alice&apos;s browser.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A basic implementation would just include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Access&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Allow&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Origin&lt;/span&gt;: *\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt; in the response headers to permit any website to read the data.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Access&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Allow&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Origin&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;//example.com&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt; would allow only a specific site to access it, and Bob can dynamically generate that based on the &lt;code&gt;Origin&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;request&lt;/em&gt; header to permit multiple, but not all, sites to access it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The specifics of how Bob sets that response header depend on Bob&apos;s HTTP server and/or server-side programming language. Users of Node.js/Express.js should use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;well-documented CORS middleware&lt;/a&gt;. Users of other platforms should take a look at this &lt;a href=&quot;https://enable-cors.org/server.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt; collection of guides for various common configurations&lt;/a&gt; that might help.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/VXM0t.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/VXM0t.png&quot; alt=&quot;Model of where CORS rules are applied&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;NB: Some requests are complex and send a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Preflighted_requests&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;preflight&lt;/a&gt; OPTIONS request that the server will have to respond to before the browser will send the GET/POST/PUT/Whatever request that the JS wants to make. Implementations of CORS that only add &lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&lt;/code&gt; to specific URLs often get tripped up by this.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously granting permission via CORS is something Bob would only do only if either:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The data was not private &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mallory was trusted&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;How do I add these headers?&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It depends on your server-side environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you can, use a library designed to handle CORS as they will present you with simple options instead of having to deal with everything manually.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://enable-cors.org/server.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Enable-Cors.org&lt;/a&gt; has a list of documentation for specific platforms and frameworks that you might find useful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;But I&apos;m not Bob!&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is no standard mechanism for &lt;em&gt;Mallory&lt;/em&gt; to add this header because it has to come from Bob&apos;s website, which she does not control.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If Bob is running a public API then there might be a mechanism to turn on CORS (perhaps by formatting the request in a certain way, or a config option after logging into a Developer Portal site for Bob&apos;s site). This will have to be a mechanism implemented by Bob though. Mallory could read the documentation on Bob&apos;s site to see if something is available, or she could talk to Bob and ask him to implement CORS.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Error messages which mention &quot;Response for preflight&quot;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some cross origin requests are &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Preflighted_requests&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;preflighted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This happens when (roughly speaking) you try to make a cross-origin request that:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Includes credentials like cookies&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Couldn&apos;t be generated with a regular HTML form (e.g. has custom headers or a Content-Type that you couldn&apos;t use in a form&apos;s &lt;code&gt;enctype&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;If you are correctly doing something that needs a preflight&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In these cases then &lt;strong&gt;the rest of this answer still applies&lt;/strong&gt; but you also need to make sure that the server can listen for the preflight request (which will be &lt;code&gt;OPTIONS&lt;/code&gt; (and not &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; or whatever you were trying to send) and respond to it with the right &lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&lt;/code&gt; header but also &lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&lt;/code&gt; to allow your specific HTTP methods or headers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;If you are triggering a preflight by mistake&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes people make mistakes when trying to construct Ajax requests, and sometimes these trigger the need for a preflight. If the API is designed to allow cross-origin requests, but doesn&apos;t require anything that would need a preflight, then this can break access.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Common mistakes that trigger this include:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;trying to put &lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&lt;/code&gt; and other CORS response headers on the request. These don&apos;t belong on the request, don&apos;t do anything helpful (what would be the point of a permissions system where you could grant yourself permission?), and must appear only on the response.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;trying to put a &lt;code&gt;Content-Type: application/json&lt;/code&gt; header on a GET request that has no request body to describe the content of (typically when the author confuses &lt;code&gt;Content-Type&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Accept&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In either of these cases, removing the extra request header will often be enough to avoid the need for a preflight (which will solve the problem when communicating with APIs that support simple requests but not preflighted requests).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Opaque responses (&lt;code&gt;no-cors&lt;/code&gt; mode)&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you need to make an HTTP request, but you don&apos;t need to read the response. e.g. if you are posting a log message to the server for recording.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you are using &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;the &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; API&lt;/a&gt; (rather than &lt;code&gt;XMLHttpRequest&lt;/code&gt;), then you can configure it to not try to use CORS.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;strong&gt;this won&apos;t let you do anything that you require CORS to do&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;You will not be able to read the response&lt;/strong&gt;. You will not be able to make a request that requires a preflight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It will let you make a simple request, not see the response, and not fill the Developer Console with error messages.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How to do it is explained by the Chrome error message given when you make a request using &lt;code&gt;fetch&lt;/code&gt; and don&apos;t get permission to view the response with CORS:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Access to fetch at &apos;&lt;code&gt;https://example.com/&lt;/code&gt;&apos; from origin &apos;&lt;code&gt;https://example.net&lt;/code&gt;&apos; has been blocked by CORS policy: No &apos;&lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&lt;/code&gt;&apos; header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request&apos;s mode to &apos;no-cors&apos; to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thus:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;fetch&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;http://example.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, { &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;no-cors&quot;&lt;/span&gt; });\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Alternatives to CORS&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;JSONP&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bob could also provide the data using a hack like &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2067472/what-is-jsonp-all-about&quot;&gt;JSONP&lt;/a&gt; which is how people did cross-origin Ajax before CORS came along.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It works by presenting the data in the form of a JavaScript program which injects the data into Mallory&apos;s page.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It requires that Mallory trust Bob not to provide malicious code.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Note the common theme: The site providing the data has to tell the browser that it is OK for a third party site to access the data it is sending to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since JSONP works by appending a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element to load the data in the form of a JavaScript program which calls a function already in the page, attempting to use the JSONP technique on a URL which returns JSON will fail  typically with a CORB error  because JSON is not JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Move the two resources to a single Origin&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If the HTML document the JS runs in and the URL being requested are on the same origin (sharing the same scheme, hostname, and port) then they Same Origin Policy grants permission by default. CORS is not needed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;A Proxy&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mallory &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; use server-side code to fetch the data (which she could then pass from her server to Alice&apos;s browser through HTTP as usual).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It will either:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;add CORS headers&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;convert the response to JSONP&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;exist on the same origin as the HTML document&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That server-side code could be written &amp;amp; hosted by a third party (such as CORS Anywhere). Note the privacy implications of this: The third party can monitor who proxies what across their servers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bob wouldn&apos;t need to grant any permissions for that to happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are no security implications here since that is just between Mallory and Bob. There is no way for Bob to think that Mallory is Alice and to provide Mallory with data that should be kept confidential between Alice and Bob.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Consequently, Mallory can only use this technique to read &lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; data.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Do note, however, that taking content from someone else&apos;s website and displaying it on your own might be a violation of &lt;em&gt;copyright&lt;/em&gt; and open you up to legal action.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Writing something other than a web app&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As noted in the section &quot;Why the Same Origin Policy only applies to JavaScript in a web page&quot;, you can avoid the SOP by not writing JavaScript in a webpage.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That doesn&apos;t mean you can&apos;t continue to use JavaScript and HTML, but you could distribute it using some other mechanism, such as Node-WebKit or PhoneGap.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Browser extensions&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is possible for a browser extension to inject the CORS headers in the response before the Same Origin Policy is applied.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These can be useful for development, but are not practical for a production site (asking every user of your site to install a browser extension that disables a security feature of their browser is unreasonable).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They also tend to work only with simple requests (failing when handling preflight OPTIONS requests).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Having a proper development environment with a local development &lt;em&gt;server&lt;/em&gt;\nis usually a better approach.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Other security risks&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Note that SOP / CORS do not mitigate &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;XSS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;CSRF&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;SQL Injection&lt;/a&gt; attacks which need to be handled independently.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There is nothing you can do in &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; client-side code that will enable CORS access to someone &lt;em&gt;else&apos;s&lt;/em&gt; server.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you control the server the request is being made to: Add CORS permissions to it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you are friendly with the person who controls it: Get them to add CORS permissions to it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If it is a public service:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Read their API documentation to see what they say about accessing it with client-side JavaScript:\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They might tell you to use specific URLs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They might support JSONP&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They might not support cross-origin access from client-side code at all (this might be a deliberate decision on security grounds, especially if you have to pass a personalised API Key in each request).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Make sure you aren&apos;t triggering a preflight request you don&apos;t need.

Don&apos;t design your page, and then change it with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;DOM&lt;/a&gt; manipulations&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In jQuery, you design a page, and then you make it dynamic. This is because jQuery was designed for augmentation and has grown incredibly from that simple premise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in AngularJS, you must start from the ground up with your architecture in mind. Instead of starting by thinking &quot;I have this piece of the DOM and I want to make it do X&quot;, you have to start with what you want to accomplish, then go about designing your application, and then finally go about designing your view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;2. Don&apos;t augment jQuery with AngularJS&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, don&apos;t start with the idea that jQuery does X, Y, and Z, so I&apos;ll just add AngularJS on top of that for models and controllers. This is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; tempting when you&apos;re just starting out, which is why I always recommend that new AngularJS developers don&apos;t use jQuery at all, at least until they get used to doing things the &quot;Angular Way&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve seen many developers here and on the mailing list create these elaborate solutions with jQuery plugins of 150 or 200 lines of code that they then glue into AngularJS with a collection of callbacks and &lt;code&gt;$apply&lt;/code&gt;s that are confusing and convoluted; but they eventually get it working! The problem is that in &lt;strong&gt;most&lt;/strong&gt; cases that jQuery plugin could be rewritten in AngularJS in a fraction of the code, where suddenly everything becomes comprehensible and straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is this: when solutioning, first &quot;think in AngularJS&quot;; if you can&apos;t think of a solution, ask the community; if after all of that there is no easy solution, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; feel free to reach for the jQuery. But don&apos;t let jQuery become a crutch or you&apos;ll never master AngularJS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;3. Always think in terms of architecture&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First know that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;single-page applications&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;em&gt;applications&lt;/em&gt;. They&apos;re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; webpages. So we need to think like a server-side developer &lt;em&gt;in addition&lt;/em&gt; to thinking like a client-side developer. We have to think about how to divide our application into individual, extensible, testable components.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So then &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; do you do that? How do you &quot;think in AngularJS&quot;? Here are some general principles, contrasted with jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The view is the &quot;official record&quot;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In jQuery, we programmatically change the view. We could have a dropdown menu defined as a &lt;code&gt;ul&lt;/code&gt; like so:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-html s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;#/home&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Menu 2&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In jQuery, in our application logic, we would activate it with something like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;$(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;.main-menu&apos;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;dropdownMenu&lt;/span&gt;();\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we just look at the view, it&apos;s not immediately obvious that there is any functionality here. For small applications, that&apos;s fine. But for non-trivial applications, things quickly get confusing and hard to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In AngularJS, though, the view is the official record of view-based functionality. Our &lt;code&gt;ul&lt;/code&gt; declaration would look like this instead:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-html s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;main-menu&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;dropdown-menu&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n    ...\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These two do the same thing, but in the AngularJS version anyone looking at the template knows what&apos;s supposed to happen. Whenever a new member of the development team comes on board, she can look at this and then &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that there is a directive called &lt;code&gt;dropdownMenu&lt;/code&gt; operating on it; she doesn&apos;t need to intuit the right answer or sift through any code. The view told us what was supposed to happen. Much cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Developers new to AngularJS often ask a question like: how do I find all links of a specific kind and add a directive onto them. The developer is always flabbergasted when we reply: you don&apos;t. But the reason you don&apos;t do that is that this is like half-jQuery, half-AngularJS, and no good. The problem here is that the developer is trying to &quot;do jQuery&quot; in the context of AngularJS. That&apos;s never going to work well. The view &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the official record. Outside of a directive (more on this below), you never, ever, &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; change the DOM. And directives are applied &lt;em&gt;in the view&lt;/em&gt;, so intent is clear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remember: don&apos;t design, and then mark up. You must architect, and then design.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Data binding&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is by far one of the most awesome features of AngularJS and cuts out a lot of the need to do the kinds of DOM manipulations I mentioned in the previous section. AngularJS will automatically update your view so you don&apos;t have to! In jQuery, we respond to events and then update content. Something like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;$.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;ajax&lt;/span&gt;({\n  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;/myEndpoint.json&apos;&lt;/span&gt;,\n  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;success&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt; data, status &lt;/span&gt;) {\n    $(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;ul#log&apos;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;Data Received!&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;);\n  }\n});\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a view that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-html s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;messages&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;log&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apart from mixing concerns, we also have the same problems of signifying intent that I mentioned before. But more importantly, we had to manually reference and update a DOM node. And if we want to delete a log entry, we have to code against the DOM for that too. How do we test the logic apart from the DOM? And what if we want to change the presentation?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This a little messy and a trifle frail. But in AngularJS, we can do this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;$http( &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;/myEndpoint.json&apos;&lt;/span&gt; ).&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;( &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt; response &lt;/span&gt;) {\n    $scope.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;( { &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;Data Received!&apos;&lt;/span&gt; } );\n});\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And our view can look like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-html s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;messages&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;li&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;ng-repeat&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;entry in log&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{ entry.msg }}&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;li&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But for that matter, our view could look like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-html s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;messages&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;alert&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;ng-repeat&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;entry in log&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n        {{ entry.msg }}\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now instead of using an unordered list, we&apos;re using Bootstrap alert boxes. And we never had to change the controller code! But more importantly, no matter &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the log gets updated, the view will change too. Automatically. Neat!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Though I didn&apos;t show it here, the data binding is two-way. So those log messages could also be editable in the view just by doing this: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;input ng-model=&quot;entry.msg&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. And there was much rejoicing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Distinct model layer&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In jQuery, the DOM is kind of like the model. But in AngularJS, we have a separate model layer that we can manage in any way we want, completely independently from the view. This helps for the above data binding, maintains &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;separation of concerns&lt;/a&gt;, and introduces far greater testability. Other answers mentioned this point, so I&apos;ll just leave it at that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Separation of concerns&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And all of the above tie into this over-arching theme: keep your concerns separate. Your view acts as the official record of what is supposed to happen (for the most part); your model represents your data; you have a service layer to perform reusable tasks; you do DOM manipulation and augment your view with directives; and you glue it all together with controllers. This was also mentioned in other answers, and the only thing I would add pertains to testability, which I discuss in another section below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Dependency injection&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To help us out with separation of concerns is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;dependency injection&lt;/a&gt; (DI). If you come from a server-side language (from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;PHP&lt;/a&gt;) you&apos;re probably familiar with this concept already, but if you&apos;re a client-side guy coming from jQuery, this concept can seem anything from silly to superfluous to hipster. But it&apos;s not. :-)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From a broad perspective, DI means that you can declare components very freely and then from any other component, just ask for an instance of it and it will be granted. You don&apos;t have to know about loading order, or file locations, or anything like that. The power may not immediately be visible, but I&apos;ll provide just one (common) example: testing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s say in our application, we require a service that implements server-side storage through a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;REST&lt;/a&gt; API and, depending on application state, local storage as well. When running tests on our controllers, we don&apos;t want to have to communicate with the server - we&apos;re testing the &lt;em&gt;controller&lt;/em&gt;, after all. We can just add a mock service of the same name as our original component, and the injector will ensure that our controller gets the fake one automatically - our controller doesn&apos;t and needn&apos;t know the difference.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of testing...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;4. Test-driven development - &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is really part of section 3 on architecture, but it&apos;s so important that I&apos;m putting it as its own top-level section.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Out of all of the many jQuery plugins you&apos;ve seen, used, or written, how many of them had an accompanying test suite? Not very many because jQuery isn&apos;t very amenable to that. But AngularJS is.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In jQuery, the only way to test is often to create the component independently with a sample/demo page against which our tests can perform DOM manipulation. So then we have to develop a component separately and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; integrate it into our application. How inconvenient! So much of the time, when developing with jQuery, we opt for iterative instead of test-driven development. And who could blame us?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But because we have separation of concerns, we can do test-driven development iteratively in AngularJS! For example, let&apos;s say we want a super-simple directive to indicate in our menu what our current route is. We can declare what we want in the view of our application:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-html s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;href&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;/hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;when-active&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Hello&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Okay, now we can write a test for the non-existent &lt;code&gt;when-active&lt;/code&gt; directive:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;( &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;should add &quot;active&quot; when the route changes&apos;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;inject&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) {\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; elm = $compile( &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;/hello&quot; when-active&amp;gt;Hello&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt; )( $scope );\n\n    $location.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;/not-matching&apos;&lt;/span&gt;);\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;( elm.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;hasClass&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;active&apos;&lt;/span&gt;) ).&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;toBeFalsey&lt;/span&gt;();\n\n    $location.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;( &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;/hello&apos;&lt;/span&gt; );\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;expect&lt;/span&gt;( elm.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;hasClass&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;active&apos;&lt;/span&gt;) ).&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;toBeTruthy&lt;/span&gt;();\n}));\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And when we run our test, we can confirm that it fails. Only now should we create our directive:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;directive&lt;/span&gt;( &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;whenActive&apos;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt; $location &lt;/span&gt;) {\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; {\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;scope&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;,\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt; scope, element, attrs &lt;/span&gt;) {\n            scope.$on( &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;$routeChangeSuccess&apos;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) {\n                &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; ( $location.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;() == element.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;attr&lt;/span&gt;( &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;href&apos;&lt;/span&gt; ) ) {\n                    element.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;addClass&lt;/span&gt;( &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;active&apos;&lt;/span&gt; );\n                }\n                &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; {\n                    element.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;removeClass&lt;/span&gt;( &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;active&apos;&lt;/span&gt; );\n                }\n            });\n        }\n    };\n});\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our test now passes &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; our menu performs as requested. Our development is &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; iterative &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; test-driven. Wicked-cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;5. Conceptually, directives are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; packaged jQuery&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&apos;ll often hear &quot;only do DOM manipulation in a directive&quot;. &lt;strong&gt;This is a necessity.&lt;/strong&gt; Treat it with due deference!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But let&apos;s dive a little deeper...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some directives just decorate what&apos;s already in the view (think &lt;code&gt;ngClass&lt;/code&gt;) and therefore sometimes do DOM manipulation straight away and then are basically done. But if a directive is like a &quot;widget&quot; and has a template, it should &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; respect separation of concerns. That is, the template &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; should remain largely independent from its implementation in the link and controller functions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJS comes with an entire set of tools to make this very easy; with &lt;code&gt;ngClass&lt;/code&gt; we can dynamically update the class; &lt;code&gt;ngModel&lt;/code&gt; allows two-way data binding; &lt;code&gt;ngShow&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ngHide&lt;/code&gt; programmatically show or hide an element; and many more - including the ones we write ourselves. In other words, we can do all kinds of awesomeness &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; DOM manipulation. The less DOM manipulation, the easier directives are to test, the easier they are to style, the easier they are to change in the future, and the more re-usable and distributable they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see lots of developers new to AngularJS using directives as the place to throw a bunch of jQuery. In other words, they think &quot;since I can&apos;t do DOM manipulation in the controller, I&apos;ll take that code put it in a directive&quot;. While that certainly is much better, it&apos;s often &lt;em&gt;still wrong&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think of the logger we programmed in section 3. Even if we put that in a directive, we &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; want to do it the &quot;Angular Way&quot;. It &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; doesn&apos;t take any DOM manipulation! There are lots of times when DOM manipulation is necessary, but it&apos;s a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; rarer than you think! Before doing DOM manipulation &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt; in your application, ask yourself if you really need to. There might be a better way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s a quick example that shows the pattern I see most frequently. We want a toggleable button. (Note: this example is a little contrived and a skosh verbose to represent more complicated cases that are solved in exactly the same way.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;directive&lt;/span&gt;( &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;myDirective&apos;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) {\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; {\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;&amp;lt;a class=&quot;btn&quot;&amp;gt;Toggle me!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;,\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt; scope, element, attrs &lt;/span&gt;) {\n            &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; on = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;;\n\n            $(element).&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;( &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) {\n                on = !on;\n                $(element).&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;toggleClass&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;active&apos;&lt;/span&gt;, on);\n            });\n        }\n    };\n});\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a few things wrong with this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;First, jQuery was never necessary. There&apos;s nothing we did here that needed jQuery at all!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Second, even if we already have jQuery on our page, there&apos;s no reason to use it here; we can simply use &lt;code&gt;angular.element&lt;/code&gt; and our component will still work when dropped into a project that doesn&apos;t have jQuery.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Third, even assuming jQuery &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; required for this directive to work, jqLite (&lt;code&gt;angular.element&lt;/code&gt;) will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; use jQuery if it was loaded! So we needn&apos;t use the &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; - we can just use &lt;code&gt;angular.element&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Fourth, closely related to the third, is that jqLite elements needn&apos;t be wrapped in &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; - the &lt;code&gt;element&lt;/code&gt; that is passed to the &lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt; function would &lt;em&gt;already be&lt;/em&gt; a jQuery element! &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;And fifth, which we&apos;ve mentioned in previous sections, why are we mixing template stuff into our logic?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This directive can be rewritten (even for very complicated cases!) much more simply like so:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;directive&lt;/span&gt;( &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;myDirective&apos;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) {\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; {\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;scope&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;,\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;&amp;lt;a class=&quot;btn&quot; ng-class=&quot;{active: on}&quot; ng-click=&quot;toggle()&quot;&amp;gt;Toggle me!&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;,\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt; scope, element, attrs &lt;/span&gt;) {\n            scope.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;;\n\n            scope.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;toggle&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) {\n                scope.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; = !scope.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;;\n            };\n        }\n    };\n});\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, the template stuff is in the template, so you (or your users) can easily swap it out for one that meets any style necessary, and the &lt;strong&gt;logic&lt;/strong&gt; never had to be touched. Reusability - boom!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And there are still all those other benefits, like testing - it&apos;s easy! No matter what&apos;s in the template, the directive&apos;s internal API is never touched, so refactoring is easy. You can change the template as much as you want without touching the directive. And no matter what you change, your tests still pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;w00t!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if directives aren&apos;t just collections of jQuery-like functions, what are they? Directives are actually &lt;strong&gt;extensions of HTML&lt;/strong&gt;. If HTML doesn&apos;t do something you need it to do, you write a directive to do it for you, and then use it just as if it was part of HTML.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Put another way, if AngularJS doesn&apos;t do something out of the box, think how the team would accomplish it to fit right in with &lt;code&gt;ngClick&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ngClass&lt;/code&gt;, et al.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t even use jQuery. Don&apos;t even include it. It will hold you back. And when you come to a problem that you think you know how to solve in jQuery already, before you reach for the &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;, try to think about how to do it within the confines the AngularJS. If you don&apos;t know, ask! 19 times out of 20, the best way to do it doesn&apos;t need jQuery and to try to solve it with jQuery results in more work for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;h2&gt;Imperative  declarative&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In jQuery, &lt;em&gt;selectors&lt;/em&gt; are used to find &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;DOM&lt;/a&gt; elements and then bind/register event handlers to them. When an event triggers, that (imperative) code executes to update/change the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In AngularJS, you want to think about &lt;strong&gt;views&lt;/strong&gt; rather than DOM elements. Views are (declarative) HTML that contain AngularJS &lt;strong&gt;directives&lt;/strong&gt;. Directives set up the event handlers behind the scenes for us and give us dynamic databinding. Selectors are rarely used, so the need for IDs (and some types of classes) is greatly diminished. Views are tied to &lt;strong&gt;models&lt;/strong&gt; (via scopes). Views are a projection of the model. Events change models (that is, data, scope properties), and the views that project those models update &quot;automatically.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In AngularJS, think about models, rather than jQuery-selected DOM elements that hold your data. Think about views as projections of those models, rather than registering callbacks to manipulate what the user sees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Separation of concerns&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;jQuery employs &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;unobtrusive JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; - behavior (JavaScript) is separated from the structure (HTML).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJS uses &lt;strong&gt;controllers&lt;/strong&gt; and directives (each of which can have their own controller, and/or compile and linking functions) to remove behavior from the view/structure (HTML).  Angular also has &lt;strong&gt;services&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;filters&lt;/strong&gt; to help separate/organize your application.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/14346528/215945&quot;&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/a/14346528/215945&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Application design&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One approach to designing an AngularJS application:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Think about your models. Create services or your own JavaScript objects for those models.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Think about how you want to present your models -- your views. Create HTML templates for each view, using the necessary directives to get dynamic databinding.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Attach a controller to each view (using ng-view and routing, or ng-controller). Have the controller find/get only whatever model data the view needs to do its job. Make controllers as thin as possible.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Prototypal inheritance&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can do a lot with jQuery without knowing about how JavaScript prototypal inheritance works. When developing AngularJS applications, you will avoid some common pitfalls if you have a good understanding of JavaScript inheritance. Recommended reading: &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14049480/what-are-the-nuances-of-scope-prototypal-prototypical-inheritance-in-angularjs&quot;&gt;What are the nuances of scope prototypal / prototypical inheritance in AngularJS?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;h1&gt;AngularJS vs. jQuery&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJS and jQuery adopt very different ideologies. If you&apos;re coming from jQuery you may find some of the differences surprising. Angular may make you angry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is normal, you should push through. Angular is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The big difference (TLDR)&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;jQuery gives you a toolkit for selecting arbitrary bits of the DOM and making ad-hoc changes to them. You can do pretty much anything you like piece by piece.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJS instead gives you a &lt;strong&gt;compiler&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What this means is that AngularJS reads your entire DOM from top to bottom and treats it as code, literally as instructions to the compiler. As it traverses the DOM, It looks for specific &lt;strong&gt;directives&lt;/strong&gt; (compiler directives) that tell the AngularJS compiler how to behave and what to do. Directives are little objects full of JavaScript which can match against attributes, tags, classes or even comments. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the Angular compiler determines that a piece of the DOM matches a particular directive, it calls the directive function, passing it the DOM element, any attributes, the current $scope (which is a local variable store), and some other useful bits. These attributes may contain expressions which can be interpreted by the Directive, and which tell it how to render, and when it should redraw itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Directives can then in turn pull in additional Angular components such as controllers, services, etc. What comes out the bottom of the compiler is a fully formed web application, wired up and ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This means that Angular is Template Driven&lt;/strong&gt;. Your template drives the JavaScript, not the other way around. This is a radical reversal of roles, and the complete opposite of the unobtrusive JavaScript we have been writing for the last 10 years or so. This can take some getting used to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this sounds like it might be over-prescriptive and limiting, nothing could be farther from the truth. Because AngularJS treats your HTML as code, you get &lt;strong&gt;HTML level granularity in your web application&lt;/strong&gt;. Everything is possible, and most things are surprisingly easy once you make a few conceptual leaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s get down to the nitty gritty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;First up, Angular doesn&apos;t replace jQuery&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Angular and jQuery do different things. AngularJS gives you a set of tools to produce web applications. jQuery mainly gives you tools for modifying the DOM. If jQuery is present on your page, AngularJS will use it automatically. If it isn&apos;t, AngularJS ships with jQuery Lite, which is a cut down, but still perfectly usable version of jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Misko likes jQuery and doesn&apos;t object to you using it. However you will find as you advance that you can get a pretty much all of your work done using a combination of scope, templates and directives, and you should prefer this workflow where possible because your code will be more discrete, more configurable, and more Angular.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you do use jQuery, you shouldn&apos;t be sprinkling it all over the place. The correct place for DOM manipulation in AngularJS is in a directive. More on these later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Unobtrusive JavaScript with Selectors vs. Declarative Templates&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;jQuery is typically applied unobtrusively. Your JavaScript code is linked in the header (or the footer), and this is the only place it is mentioned. We use selectors to pick out bits of the page and write plugins to modify those parts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The JavaScript is in control. The HTML has a completely independent existence. Your HTML remains semantic even without JavaScript. Onclick attributes are very bad practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the first things your will notice about AngularJS is that &lt;strong&gt;custom attributes are everywhere&lt;/strong&gt;. Your HTML will be littered with ng attributes, which are essentially onClick attributes on steroids. These are directives (compiler directives), and are one of the main ways in which the template is hooked to the model.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you first see this you might be tempted to write AngularJS off as old school intrusive JavaScript (like I did at first). In fact, AngularJS does not play by those rules. In AngularJS, your HTML5 is a template. It is compiled by AngularJS to produce your web page.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the first big difference. To jQuery, your web page is a DOM to be manipulated. To AngularJS, your HTML is code to be compiled. AngularJS reads in your whole web page and literally compiles it into a new web page using its built in compiler.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your template should be declarative; its meaning should be clear simply by reading it. We use custom attributes with meaningful names. We make up new HTML elements, again with meaningful names. A designer with minimal HTML knowledge and no coding skill can read your AngularJS template and understand what it is doing. He or she can make modifications. &lt;em&gt;This is the Angular way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The template is in the driving seat.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the first questions I asked myself when starting AngularJS and running through the tutorials is &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Where is my code?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. I&apos;ve written no JavaScript, and yet I have all this behaviour. The answer is obvious. Because AngularJS compiles the DOM, AngularJS is treating your HTML as code. For many simple cases it&apos;s often sufficient to just write a template and let AngularJS compile it into an application for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your template drives your application. It&apos;s treated as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;DSL&lt;/a&gt;. You write AngularJS components, and AngularJS will take care of pulling them in and making them available at the right time based on the structure of your template. This is very different to a standard &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;MVC&lt;/a&gt; pattern, where the template is just for output.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s more similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;XSLT&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt; for example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a radical inversion of control that takes some getting used to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop trying to drive your application from your JavaScript. Let the template drive the application, and let AngularJS take care of wiring the components together. This also is the Angular way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Semantic HTML vs. Semantic Models&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With jQuery your HTML page should contain semantic meaningful content. If the JavaScript is turned off (by a user or search engine) your content remains accessible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because AngularJS treats your HTML page as a template. The template is not supposed to be semantic as your content is typically stored in your model which ultimately comes from your API. AngularJS compiles your DOM with the model to produce a semantic web page.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your HTML source is no longer semantic, instead, your API and compiled DOM are semantic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In AngularJS, meaning lives in the model, the HTML is just a template, for display only.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point you likely have all sorts of questions concerning &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;SEO&lt;/a&gt; and accessibility, and rightly so. There are open issues here. Most screen readers will now parse JavaScript. Search engines can also index &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;AJAXed&lt;/a&gt; content. Nevertheless, you will want to make sure you are using pushstate URLs and you have a decent sitemap. See here for a discussion of the issue: &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/23245379/687677&quot;&gt;https://stackoverflow.com/a/23245379/687677&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Separation of concerns (SOC) vs. MVC&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Separation of concerns&lt;/a&gt; (SOC) is a pattern that grew up over many years of web development for a variety of reasons including SEO, accessibility and browser incompatibility. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;HTML - Semantic meaning. The HTML should stand alone.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;CSS - Styling, without the CSS the page is still readable.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;JavaScript - Behaviour, without the script the content remains.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again, AngularJS does not play by their rules. In a stroke, &lt;strong&gt;AngularJS does away with a decade of received wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; and instead implements an MVC pattern in which the template is no longer semantic, not even a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Model - your models contains your semantic data. Models are usually &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;JSON&lt;/a&gt; objects. Models exist as attributes of an object called $scope. You can also store handy utility functions on $scope which your templates can then access.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;View - Your views are written in HTML. The view is usually not semantic because your data lives in the model.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Controller - Your controller is a JavaScript function which hooks the view to the model. Its function is to initialise $scope. Depending on your application, you may or may not need to create a controller. You can have many controllers on a page.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MVC and SOC are not on opposite ends of the same scale, they are on completely different axes. SOC makes no sense in an AngularJS context. You have to forget it and move on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If, like me, you lived through the browser wars, you might find this idea quite offensive. Get over it, it&apos;ll be worth it, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Plugins vs. Directives&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plugins extend jQuery. AngularJS Directives extend the capabilities of your browser.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In jQuery we define plugins by adding functions to the jQuery.prototype. We then hook these into the DOM by selecting elements and calling the plugin on the result. The idea is to extend the capabilities of jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, if you want a carousel on your page, you might define an unordered list of figures, perhaps wrapped in a nav element. You might then write some jQuery to select the list on the page and restyle it as a gallery with timeouts to do the sliding animation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In AngularJS, we define directives. A directive is a function which returns a JSON object. This object tells AngularJS what DOM elements to look for, and what changes to make to them. Directives are hooked in to the template using either attributes or elements, which you invent. The idea is to extend the capabilities of HTML with new attributes and elements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AngularJS way is to extend the capabilities of native looking HTML.&lt;/em&gt; You should write HTML that looks like HTML, extended with custom attributes and elements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want a carousel, just use a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;carousel /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element, then define a directive to pull in a template, and make that sucker work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Lots of small directives vs. big plugins with configuration switches&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tendency with jQuery is to write great big plugins like lightbox which we then configure by passing in numerous values and options.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a mistake in AngularJS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take the example of a dropdown. When writing a dropdown plugin you might be tempted to code in click handlers, perhaps a function to add in a chevron which is either up or down, perhaps change the class of the unfolded element, show hide the menu, all helpful stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until you want to make a small change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Say you have a menu that you want to unfold on hover. Well now we have a problem. Our plugin has wired in our click handler for us, we&apos;re going to need to add a configuration option to make it behave differently in this specific case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In AngularJS we write smaller directives. Our dropdown directive would be ridiculously small. It might maintain the folded state, and provide methods to fold(), unfold() or toggle(). These methods would simply update $scope.menu.visible which is a boolean holding the state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now &lt;strong&gt;in our template&lt;/strong&gt; we can wire this up:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a ng-click=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;toggle()&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Menu&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;language-xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;ng-show&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;menu.visible&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n  ...\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Need to update on mouseover?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a ng-mouseenter=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;unfold()&quot;&lt;/span&gt; ng-mouseleave=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;fold()&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Menu&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;language-xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;ng-show&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;menu.visible&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n  ...\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;ul&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The template drives the application so we get HTML level granularity. If we want to make case by case exceptions, the template makes this easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Closure vs. $scope&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;JQuery plugins are created in a closure. Privacy is maintained within that closure. It&apos;s up to you to maintain your scope chain within that closure. You only really have access to the set of DOM nodes passed in to the plugin by jQuery, plus any local variables defined in the closure and any globals you have defined. This means that plugins are quite self contained. This is a good thing, but can get restrictive when creating a whole application. Trying to pass data between sections of a dynamic page becomes a chore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJS has $scope objects. These are special objects created and maintained by AngularJS in which you store your model. Certain directives will spawn a new $scope, which by default inherits from its wrapping $scope using JavaScript prototypical inheritance. The $scope object is accessible in the controller and the view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the clever part. Because the structure of $scope inheritance roughly follows the structure of the DOM, elements have access to their own scope, and any containing scopes seamlessly, all the way up to the global $scope (which is not the same as the global scope).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This makes it much easier to pass data around, and to store data at an appropriate level. If a dropdown is unfolded, only the dropdown $scope needs to know about it. If the user updates their preferences, you might want to update the global $scope, and any nested scopes listening to the user preferences would automatically be alerted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This might sound complicated, in fact, once you relax into it, it&apos;s like flying. You don&apos;t need to create the $scope object, AngularJS instantiates and configures it for you, correctly and appropriately based on your template hierarchy. AngularJS then makes it available to your component using the magic of dependency injection (more on this later).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Manual DOM changes vs. Data Binding&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In jQuery you make all your DOM changes by hand. You construct new DOM elements programatically. If you have a JSON array and you want to put it to the DOM, you must write a function to generate the HTML and insert it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In AngularJS you can do this too, but you are encouraged to make use of data binding. Change your model, and because the DOM is bound to it via a template your DOM will automatically update, no intervention required.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because data binding is done from the template, using either an attribute or the curly brace syntax, it&apos;s super easy to do. There&apos;s little cognitive overhead associated with it so you&apos;ll find yourself doing it all the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;input ng-model=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;user.name&quot;&lt;/span&gt; /&amp;gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Binds the input element to &lt;code&gt;$scope.user.name&lt;/code&gt;. Updating the input will update the value in your current scope, and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\n  {{user.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;}}\n&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;will output the user name in a paragraph. It&apos;s a live binding, so if the &lt;code&gt;$scope.user.name&lt;/code&gt; value is updated, the template will update too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Ajax all of the time&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In jQuery making an Ajax call is fairly simple, but it&apos;s still something you might think twice about. There&apos;s the added complexity to think about, and a fair chunk of script to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In AngularJS, Ajax is your default go-to solution and it happens all the time, almost without you noticing. You can include templates with ng-include. You can apply a template with the simplest custom directive. You can wrap an Ajax call in a service and create yourself a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; service, or a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flickr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; service, which you can access with astonishing ease.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Service Objects vs Helper Functions&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In jQuery, if we want to accomplish a small non-dom related task such as pulling a feed from an API, we might write a little function to do that in our closure. That&apos;s a valid solution, but what if we  want to access that feed often? What if we want to reuse that code in another application?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJS gives us service objects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Services are simple objects that contain functions and data. They are always singletons, meaning there can never be more than one of them. Say we want to access the Stack Overflow API, we might write a &lt;code&gt;StackOverflowService&lt;/code&gt; which defines methods for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s say we have a shopping cart. We might define a ShoppingCartService which maintains our cart and contains methods for adding and removing items. Because the service is a singleton, and is shared by all other components, any object that needs to can write to the shopping cart and pull data from it. It&apos;s always the same cart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Service objects are self-contained AngularJS components which we can use and reuse as we see fit. They are simple JSON objects containing functions and Data. They are always singletons, so if you store data on a service in one place, you can get that data out somewhere else just by requesting the same service.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Dependency injection&lt;/a&gt; (DI) vs. Instatiation - aka de-spaghettification&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJS manages your dependencies for you. If you want an object, simply refer to it and AngularJS will get it for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until you start to use this, it&apos;s hard to explain just what a massive time boon this is. Nothing like AngularJS DI exists inside jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;DI means that instead of writing your application and wiring it together, you instead define a library of components, each identified by a string.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Say I have a component called &apos;FlickrService&apos; which defines methods for pulling JSON feeds from Flickr. Now, if I want to write a controller that can access Flickr, I just need to refer to the &apos;FlickrService&apos; by name when I declare the controller. AngularJS will take care of instantiating the component and making it available to my controller.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, here I define a service:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;myApp.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;FlickrService&apos;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) {\n  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; {\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;getFeed&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) { &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// do something here }&lt;/span&gt;\n  }\n});\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now when I want to use that service I just refer to it by name like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;myApp.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;controller&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;myController&apos;&lt;/span&gt;, [&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;FlickrService&apos;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;FlickrService&lt;/span&gt;) {\n  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;FlickrService&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;getFeed&lt;/span&gt;()\n}]);\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJS will recognise that a FlickrService object is needed to instantiate the controller, and will provide one for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This makes wiring things together very easy, and pretty much eliminates any tendency towards spagettification. We have a flat list of components, and AngularJS hands them to us one by one as and when we need them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Modular service architecture&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;jQuery says very little about how you should organise your code. AngularJS has opinions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJS gives you modules into which you can place your code. If you&apos;re writing a script that talks to Flickr for example, you might want to create a Flickr module to wrap all your Flickr related functions in. Modules can include other modules (DI). Your main application is usually a module, and this should include all the other modules your application will depend on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You get simple code reuse, if you want to write another application based on Flickr, you can just include the Flickr module and voila, you have access to all your Flickr related functions in your new application.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Modules contain AngularJS components. &lt;strong&gt;When we include a module, all the components in that module become available to us as a simple list identified by their unique strings&lt;/strong&gt;. We can then inject those components into each other using AngularJS&apos;s dependency injection mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;To sum up&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJS and jQuery are not enemies. It&apos;s possible to use jQuery within AngularJS very nicely. If you&apos;re using AngularJS well (templates, data-binding, $scope, directives, etc.) you will find you need a &lt;strong&gt;lot&lt;/strong&gt; less jQuery than you might otherwise require.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main thing to realise is that your template drives your application. Stop trying to write big plugins that do everything. Instead write little directives that do one thing, then write a simple template to wire them together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think less about unobtrusive JavaScript, and instead think in terms of HTML extensions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;My little book&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got so excited about AngularJS, I wrote a short book on it which you&apos;re very welcome to read online &lt;a href=&quot;http://nicholasjohnson.com/angular-book/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://nicholasjohnson.com/angular-book/&lt;/a&gt;. I hope it&apos;s helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Can you describe the paradigm shift that is necessary?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imperative vs Declarative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With &lt;strong&gt;jQuery&lt;/strong&gt; you tell the DOM what needs to happen, step by step. With &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;AngularJS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; you describe what results you want but not how to do it. More on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1784664/what-is-the-difference-between-declarative-and-imperative-programming&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Also, check out Mark Rajcok&apos;s answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;How do I architect and design client-side web apps differently? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJS is an entire client-side framework that uses the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;MVC&lt;/a&gt; pattern (check out their &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/concepts&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;graphical representation&lt;/a&gt;). It greatly focuses on separation of concerns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;What is the biggest difference? What should I stop doing/using; what should I start doing/using instead?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;jQuery&lt;/strong&gt; is a library &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AngularJS&lt;/strong&gt; is a beautiful client-side framework, highly testable, that combines tons of cool stuff such as MVC, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;dependency injection&lt;/a&gt;, data binding and much more. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It focuses on &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;separation of concerns&lt;/a&gt; and testing (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;unit testing&lt;/a&gt; and end-to-end testing), which facilitates test-driven development.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best way to start is going through &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;their awesome tutorial&lt;/a&gt;. You can go through the steps in a couple of hours; however, in case you want to master the concepts behind the scenes, they include a myriad of reference for further reading.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Are there any server-side considerations/restrictions?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may use it on existing applications where you are already using pure jQuery. However, if you want to fully take advantage of the AngularJS features you may consider coding the server side using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#RESTful_web_services&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;RESTful&lt;/a&gt; approach.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doing so will allow you to leverage their &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource.$resource&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;resource factory&lt;/a&gt;, which creates an abstraction of your server side RESTful &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt; and makes server-side calls (get, save, delete, etc.) incredibly easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;To describe the &quot;paradigm shift&quot;, I think a short answer can suffice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;AngularJS changes the way you &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; elements&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;jQuery&lt;/strong&gt;, you typically  use &lt;strong&gt;selectors&lt;/strong&gt; to find elements, and then wire them up:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;code&gt;$(&apos;#id .class&apos;).click(doStuff);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;AngularJS&lt;/strong&gt;, you use &lt;strong&gt;directives&lt;/strong&gt; to mark the elements directly, to wire them up:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a ng-click=&quot;doStuff()&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJS doesn&apos;t need (or want) you to find elements using selectors - the primary difference between AngularJS&apos;s &lt;strong&gt;jqLite&lt;/strong&gt; versus full-blown &lt;strong&gt;jQuery&lt;/strong&gt; is that &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/function/angular.element&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;jqLite does not support selectors&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So when people say &quot;don&apos;t include jQuery at all&quot;, it&apos;s mainly because they don&apos;t want you to use selectors; they want you to learn to use directives instead. Direct, not select!&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;h1&gt;jQuery&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;jQuery makes ridiculously long JavaScript commands like &lt;code&gt;getElementByHerpDerp&lt;/code&gt; shorter and cross-browser.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;AngularJS&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJS allows you to make your own HTML tags/attributes that do things which work well with dynamic web applications (since HTML was designed for static pages).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Edit:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saying &quot;I have a jQuery background how do I think in AngularJS?&quot; is like saying &quot;I have an HTML background how do I think in JavaScript?&quot; The fact that you&apos;re asking the question shows you most likely don&apos;t understand the fundamental purposes of these two resources. This is why I chose to answer the question by simply pointing out the fundamental difference rather than going through the list saying &quot;AngularJS makes use of directives whereas jQuery uses CSS selectors to make a jQuery object which does this and that etc....&quot;. This question does not require a lengthy answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;jQuery is a way to make programming JavaScript in the browser easier. Shorter, cross-browser commands, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJS extends HTML, so you don&apos;t have to put &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; all over the place just to make an application. It makes HTML actually work for applications rather than what it was designed for, which is static, educational web pages. It accomplishes this in a roundabout way using JavaScript, but fundamentally it is an extension of HTML, not JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;jQuery: you think a lot about &apos;QUERYing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;DOM&lt;/a&gt;&apos; for DOM elements and doing something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJS: THE model is the truth, and you always think from that ANGLE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, when you get data from THE server which you intend to display in some format in the DOM, in jQuery, you need to &apos;1. FIND&apos; where in the DOM you want to place this data, the &apos;2. UPDATE/APPEND&apos; it there by creating a new node or just setting its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tizag.com/javascriptT/javascript-innerHTML.php&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;innerHTML&lt;/a&gt;. Then when you want to update this view, you then &apos;3. FIND&apos; the location and &apos;4. UPDATE&apos;. This cycle of find and update all done within the same context of getting and formatting data from server is gone in AngularJS.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With AngularJS you have your model (JavaScript objects you are already used to) and the value of the model tells you about the model (obviously) and about the view, and an operation on the model automatically propagates to the view, so you don&apos;t have to think about it. You will find yourself in AngularJS no longer finding things in the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To put in another way, in jQuery, you need to think about CSS selectors, that is, where is the &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt; that has a class or attribute, etc., so that I can get their HTML or color or value, but in AngularJS, you will find yourself thinking like this: what model am I dealing with, I will set the model&apos;s value to true. You are not bothering yourself of whether the view reflecting this value is a checked box or resides in a &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt; element (details you would have often needed to think about in jQuery).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And with DOM manipulation in AngularJS, you find yourself adding directives and filters, which you can think of as valid HTML extensions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One more thing you will experience in AngularJS: in jQuery you call the jQuery functions a lot, in AngularJS, AngularJS will call your functions, so AngularJS will &apos;tell you how to do things&apos;, but the benefits are worth it, so learning AngularJS usually means learning what AngularJS wants or the way AngularJS requires that you present your functions and it will call it accordingly. This is one of the things that makes AngularJS a framework rather than a library.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Those are some very nice, but lengthy answers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To sum up my experiences:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Controllers and providers (services, factories, etc.) are for modifying the data model, NOT HTML.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;HTML and directives define the layout and binding to the model.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you need to share data between controllers, create a service or factory - they are singletons that are shared across the application.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you need an HTML widget, create a directive.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have some data and are now trying to update HTML... STOP! update the model, and make sure your HTML is bound to the model.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;jQuery is a DOM manipulation library.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJS is an MV* framework.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, AngularJS is one of the few JavaScript MV* frameworks (many JavaScript MVC tools still fall under the category library).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being a framework, it hosts your code and takes ownership of decisions about what to call and when!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJS itself includes a jQuery-lite edition within it. So for some basic DOM selection/manipulation, you really don&apos;t have to include the jQuery library (it saves many bytes to run on the network.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJS has the concept of &quot;Directives&quot; for DOM manipulation and designing reusable UI components, so you should use it whenever you feel the need of doing DOM manipulation related stuff (directives are only place where you should write jQuery code while using AngularJS).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJS involves some learning curve (more than jQuery :-).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;--&amp;gt;For any developer coming from jQuery background, my first advice would be to &quot;learn JavaScript as a first class language before jumping onto a rich framework like AngularJS!&quot;\nI learned the above fact the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;They&apos;re apples and oranges. You don&apos;t want to compare them. They&apos;re two different things. AngularJs has already jQuery lite built in which allows you to perform basic DOM manipulation without even including the full blown jQuery version. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;jQuery is all about DOM manipulation. It solves all the cross browser pain otherwise you will have to deal with but it&apos;s not a framework that allows you to divide your app into components like AngularJS. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A nice thing about AngularJs is that it allows you to separate/isolate the DOM manipulation in the directives.  There are built-in directives ready for you to use such as ng-click. You can create your own custom directives that will contain all your view logic or DOM manipulation so you don&apos;t end up mingle DOM manipulation code in the controllers or services that should take care of the business logic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Angular breaks down your app into \n- Controllers\n- Services\n- Views\n- etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and there is one more thing, that&apos;s the directive. It&apos;s an attribute  you can attach to any DOM element and you can go nuts with jQuery within it without worrying about your jQuery ever conflicts with AngularJs components or messes up with its architecture. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I heard from a meetup I attended, one of the founders of Angular said they worked really hard to separate out the DOM manipulation so do not try to include them back in. &lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Listen to the podcast &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://javascriptjabber.com/032-jsj-angular-js/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;JavaScript Jabber: Episode #32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; that features the original creators of AngularJS: Misko Hevery &amp;amp; Igor Minar. They talk a lot about what it&apos;s like to come to AngularJS from other JavaScript backgrounds, especially jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One of the points made in the podcast made a lot of things click for me with respects to your question:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MISKO&lt;/strong&gt;: [...] one of the things we thought about very hardly in Angular is, how do we provide lots of escape hatches so that you can get out and basically figure out a way out of this. So to us, the answer is this thing called Directives. &lt;strong&gt;And with directives, you essentially become a regular little jQuery JavaScript, you can do whatever you want.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IGOR&lt;/strong&gt;: So think of directive as the instruction to the compiler that tells it whenever you come across this certain element or this CSS in the template, and you keep this kind of code and that code is in charge of the element and everything below that element in the DOM tree.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A transcript of the entire episode is available at the link provided above.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, to directly answer your question: AngularJS is -very- opinionated and is a true MV* framework. However, you can still do all of the really cool stuff you know and love with jQuery inside of directives. It&apos;s not a matter of &quot;How do I do what I used to in jQuery?&quot; as much as it&apos;s a matter of &quot;How do I supplement AngularJS with all of the stuff I used to do in jQuery?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s really two very different states of mind.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;I find this question interesting, because my first serious exposure to JavaScript programming was &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; and AngularJS. I never learned jQuery, and I guess that&apos;s a good thing, because I don&apos;t have to unlearn anything. In fact, I actively avoid jQuery solutions to my problems, and instead, solely look for an &quot;AngularJS way&quot; to solve them. So, I guess my answer to this question would essentially boil down to, &quot;think like someone who never learned jQuery&quot; and avoid any temptation to incorporate jQuery directly (obviously AngularJS uses it to some extent behind the scenes).&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AngularJS and jQuery:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJs and JQuery are completely different at every level except the JQLite functionality and you will see it once you start learning the AngularJs core features (I explained it below).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJs is a client side framework that offers to build the independent client side application. JQuery is a client side library that play around the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AngularJs Cool Principle - If you want some changes on your UI think from model data change perspective. Change your data and UI will re-render itself. You need not to play around DOM each time unless and until it is hardly required and that should also be handled through Angular Directives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, I want to share my experience on the first enterprise application with AngularJS. These are the most awesome features that Angular provide where we start changing our jQuery mindset and we get the Angular like a framework and not the library.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two-way data binding is amazing:&lt;/strong&gt; \nI had a grid with all functionality UPDATE, DELTE, INSERT. I have a data object that binds the grid&apos;s model using ng-repeat. You only need to write a single line of simple JavaScript code for delete and insert and that&apos;s it. grid automatically updates as the grid model changes instantly. Update functionality is real time, no code for it.\nYou feel amazing!!!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reusable directives are super:&lt;/strong&gt;\nWrite directives in one place and use it throughout the application. OMG!!! I used these directive for paging, regex, validations, etc. It is really cool!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routing is strong:&lt;/strong&gt;\nIt&apos;s up to your implementation how you want to use it, but it requires very few lines of code to route the request to specify HTML and controller (JavaScript)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controllers are great:&lt;/strong&gt;\nControllers take care of their own HTML, but this separation works well for common functionality well as. If you want to call the same function on the click of a button on master HTML, just write the same function name in each controller and write individual code.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plugins:&lt;/strong&gt;\nThere are many other similar features like showing an overlay in your app. You don&apos;t need to write code for it, just use an overlay plugin available as wc-overlay, and this will automatically take care of all &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;XMLHttpRequest&lt;/a&gt; (XHR) requests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ideal for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#RESTful_web_services&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;RESTful&lt;/a&gt; architecture:&lt;/strong&gt;\nBeing a complete frameworks makes AngularJS great to work with a RESTful architecture. To call REST CRUD APIs is very easier and &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Services&lt;/strong&gt;: Write common codes using services and less code in controllers. Sevices can be used to share common functionalities among the controllers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensibility&lt;/strong&gt;: Angular has extended the HTML directives using angular directives. Write expressions inside html and evaluate them on runtime. Create your own directives and services and use them in another project without any extra effort.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;As a JavaScript MV* beginner and purely focusing on the application architecture (not the server/client-side matters), I would certainly recommend the following resource (which I am surprised wasn&apos;t mentioned yet): &lt;a href=&quot;http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/&quot;&gt;JavaScript Design Patterns&lt;/a&gt;, by Addy Osmani, as an introduction to different &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript Design Patterns&lt;/strong&gt;. The terms used in this answer are taken from the linked document above. I&apos;m not going to repeat what was worded really well in the accepted answer. Instead, this answer links back to the &lt;strong&gt;theoretical backgrounds&lt;/strong&gt; which power AngularJS (and other libraries).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like me, you will quickly realize that AngularJS (or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember.js&quot;&gt;Ember.js&lt;/a&gt;, Durandal, &amp;amp; other MV* frameworks for that matter) is one complex framework assembling many of the different JavaScript design patterns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I found it easier also, to test &lt;strong&gt;(1)&lt;/strong&gt; native JavaScript code and &lt;strong&gt;(2)&lt;/strong&gt; smaller libraries for each one of these patterns &lt;strong&gt;separately&lt;/strong&gt; before diving into one global framework. This allowed me to better understand which crucial issues a framework adresses (because you are personally faced with the problem).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.be/search?q=js+oop&quot;&gt;JavaScript Object-oriented Programming&lt;/a&gt; (this is a Google search link). It is not a library, but certainly a prerequisite to any application programming.

AngularJS itself has the binding and directive, which is a very good &quot;replacement&quot; for most things you can do with jQuery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I usually develop mobile applications using AngularJS and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhoneGap&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Cordova&lt;/a&gt;. The ONLY thing from jQuery I needed is the Selector.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By googling, I see that there is a standalone jQuery selector module out there. It&apos;s Sizzle. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I decided to make a tiny code snippet that help me quickly start a website using AngularJS with the power of jQuery Selector (using Sizzle).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shared my code here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/huytd/Sizzular&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://github.com/huytd/Sizzular&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    "],"148":["\n&lt;h2&gt;The &lt;code&gt;document.domain&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Method type: &lt;strong&gt;iframe&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that this is an iframe method that sets the value of document.domain to a suffix of the current domain. If it does so, the shorter domain is used for subsequent origin checks. For example, assume a script in the document at &lt;code&gt;http://store.company.com/dir/other.html&lt;/code&gt; executes the following statement:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable language_&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;domain&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;company.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After that statement executes, the page would pass the origin check with &lt;code&gt;http://company.com/dir/page.html&lt;/code&gt;. However, by the same reasoning, company.com could not set &lt;code&gt;document.domain&lt;/code&gt;  to &lt;code&gt;othercompany.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With this method, you would be allowed to exectue javascript from an iframe sourced on a subdomain on a page sourced on the main domain. This method is not suited for cross-domain resources as browsers like Firefox will not allow you to change the &lt;code&gt;document.domain&lt;/code&gt; to a completely alien domain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing method&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Method type: &lt;strong&gt;AJAX&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/access-control/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Cross-Origin Resource Sharing&lt;/a&gt; (CORS) is a W3C Working Draft that defines how the browser and server must communicate when accessing sources across origins. The basic idea behind CORS is to use custom HTTP headers to allow both the browser and the server to know enough about each other to determine if the request or response should succeed or fail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a simple request, one that uses either &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; with no custom headers and whose body is &lt;code&gt;text/plain&lt;/code&gt;, the request is sent with an extra header called &lt;code&gt;Origin&lt;/code&gt;. The Origin  header contains the origin (protocol, domain name, and port) of the requesting page so that the server can easily determine whether or not it should serve a response. An example &lt;code&gt;Origin&lt;/code&gt; header might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Origin&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;//www.stackoverflow.com&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the server decides that the request should be allowed, it sends a &lt;code&gt;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&lt;/code&gt; header echoing back the same origin that was sent or &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; if its a public resource. For example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Access&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Control&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Allow&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Origin&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;//www.stackoverflow.com&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If this header is missing, or the origins dont match, then the browser disallows the request. If all is well, then the browser processes the request. Note that neither the requests nor responses include cookie information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Mozilla team suggests in &lt;a href=&quot;http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/07/cross-site-xmlhttprequest-with-cors/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;their post about CORS&lt;/a&gt; that you should check for the existence of the &lt;code&gt;withCredentials&lt;/code&gt;  property to determine if the browser supports CORS via XHR. You can then couple with the existence of the &lt;code&gt;XDomainRequest&lt;/code&gt; object to cover all browsers:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;createCORSRequest&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;method, url&lt;/span&gt;){\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; xhr = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;XMLHttpRequest&lt;/span&gt;();\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;withCredentials&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; xhr){\n        xhr.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;(method, url, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;);\n    } &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;XDomainRequest&lt;/span&gt; != &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;undefined&quot;&lt;/span&gt;){\n        xhr = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;XDomainRequest&lt;/span&gt;();\n        xhr.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;(method, url);\n    } &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; {\n        xhr = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;;\n    }\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; xhr;\n}\n\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; request = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;createCORSRequest&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;get&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;http://www.stackoverflow.com/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (request){\n    request.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;onload&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) {\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;\n    };\n    request.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;onreadystatechange&lt;/span&gt; = handler;\n    request.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;();\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that for the CORS method to work, you need to have access to any type of server header mechanic and can&apos;t simply access any third-party resource.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/05/25/cross-domain-ajax-with-cross-origin-resource-sharing/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2010/05/25/cross-domain-ajax-with-cross-origin-resource-sharing/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The &lt;code&gt;window.postMessage&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Method type: &lt;strong&gt;iframe&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;window.postMessage&lt;/code&gt;, when called, causes a &lt;code&gt;MessageEvent&lt;/code&gt; to be dispatched at the target window when any pending script that must be executed completes (e.g. remaining event handlers if &lt;code&gt;window.postMessage&lt;/code&gt; is called from an event handler, previously-set pending timeouts, etc.).

Consequently, any event listener used to receive messages must  first check the identity of the sender of the message, using the origin  and possibly source properties. This cannot be understated: &lt;strong&gt;Failure to check the &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; and possibly &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; properties enables cross-site scripting attacks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.postMessage&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.postMessage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Reverse Proxy method&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Method type: &lt;strong&gt;Ajax&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Setting up a simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;reverse proxy&lt;/a&gt; on the server, will allow the browser to use relative paths for the Ajax requests, while the server would be acting as a proxy to any remote location. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If using &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;mod_proxy&lt;/a&gt; in Apache, the fundamental configuration directive to set up a reverse proxy is the &lt;code&gt;ProxyPass&lt;/code&gt;. It is typically used as follows:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;ProxyPass&lt;/span&gt;     /ajax/     &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;//other-domain.com/ajax/&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In this case, the browser would be able to request &lt;code&gt;/ajax/web_service.xml&lt;/code&gt; as a relative URL, but the server would serve this by acting as a proxy to &lt;code&gt;http://other-domain.com/ajax/web_service.xml&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One interesting feature of the this method is that the reverse proxy can easily distribute requests towards multiple back-ends, thus acting as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancer&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;load balancer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;I use JSONP.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically, you add&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script src=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;http://..../someData.js?callback=some_func&quot;&lt;/span&gt;/&amp;gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;on your page.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;some_func() should get called so that you are notified that the data is in.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;AnyOrigin didn&apos;t function well with some https sites, so I just wrote an open source alternative called &lt;a href=&quot;http://whateverorigin.org&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;whateverorigin.org&lt;/a&gt; that seems to work well with https.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ripper234/Whatever-Origin&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Code on github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;The most recent way of overcoming the same-origin policy that I&apos;ve found is &lt;a href=&quot;http://anyorigin.com/&quot;&gt;http://anyorigin.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The site&apos;s made so that you just give it any url and it generates javascript/jquery code for you that lets you get the html/data, regardless of it&apos;s origin.

This means that if one type of object can be substituted for another in a method (for instance, &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; can be replaced with &lt;code&gt;Dog&lt;/code&gt;), the same applies to expressions using those objects (so &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; could be replaced with &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;). The problem is that covariance is not safe for mutable lists in general.  Suppose you have a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and it is being used as a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  What happens when you try to add a Cat to this &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which is really a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;?  Automatically allowing type parameters to be covariant breaks the type system.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be useful to add syntax to allow type parameters to be specified as covariant, which avoids the &lt;code&gt;? extends Foo&lt;/code&gt; in method declarations, but that does add additional complexity.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;The reason a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is not a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, is that, for example, you can insert a &lt;code&gt;Cat&lt;/code&gt; into a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, but not into a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;... you can use wildcards to make generics more extensible where possible; for example, reading from  a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the similar to reading from a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; -- but not writing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/generics.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Generics in the Java Language&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/generics/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Section on Generics from the Java Tutorials&lt;/a&gt; have a very good, in-depth explanation as to why some things are or are not polymorphic or permitted with generics.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;A point I think should be added to what &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/2745301/1593077&quot;&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/2745319/1593077&quot;&gt;answers&lt;/a&gt; mention is that while&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; isn&apos;t-a &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;in Java&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;it is also true that&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A list of dogs is-a list of animals &lt;strong&gt;in English&lt;/strong&gt; (under a reasonable interpretation)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The way the OP&apos;s intuition works - which is completely valid of course - is the latter sentence. However, if we apply this intuition we get a language that is not Java-esque in its type system: Suppose our language does allow adding a cat to our list of dogs. What would that mean? It would mean that the list ceases to be a list of dogs, and remains merely a list of animals. And a list of mammals, and a list of quadrapeds.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To put it another way: A &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in Java does not mean &quot;a list of dogs&quot; in English, it means &quot;a list of dogs and nothing other than dogs&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More generally, &lt;strong&gt;OP&apos;s intuition lends itself towards a language in which operations on objects can change their type&lt;/strong&gt;, or rather, an object&apos;s type(s) is a (dynamic) function of its value.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;I would say the whole point of Generics is that it doesn&apos;t allow that. Consider the situation with arrays, which do allow that type of covariance:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;  Object[] objects = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;];\n  objects[&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;] = Boolean.FALSE;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That code compiles fine, but throws a runtime error (&lt;code&gt;java.lang.ArrayStoreException: java.lang.Boolean&lt;/code&gt; in the second line). It is not typesafe. The point of Generics is to add the compile time type safety, otherwise you could just stick with a plain class without generics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now there are times where you need to be more flexible and that is what the &lt;code&gt;? super Class&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;? extends Class&lt;/code&gt; are for. The former is when you need to insert into a type &lt;code&gt;Collection&lt;/code&gt; (for example), and the latter is for when you need to read from it, in a type safe manner. But the only way to do both at the same time is to have a specific type.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;To understand the problem it&apos;s useful to make comparison to arrays.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; subclass of &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;But&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;Dog[]&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; subclass of &lt;code&gt;Animal[]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arrays are &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/nonReifiableVarargsType.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;reifiable&lt;/a&gt; and covariant&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/nonReifiableVarargsType.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Reifiable&lt;/a&gt; means their type information is fully available at runtime. &lt;br&gt;Therefore arrays provide runtime type safety but not compile-time type safety.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// All compiles but throws ArrayStoreException at runtime at last line&lt;/span&gt;\n    Dog[] dogs = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;];\n    Animal[] animals = dogs; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// compiles&lt;/span&gt;\n    animals[&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;] = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Cat&lt;/span&gt;(); &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// throws ArrayStoreException at runtime&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s vice versa for generics:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Generics are &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/genTypes.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;erased&lt;/a&gt; and invariant&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;br&gt;Therefore generics can&apos;t provide runtime type safety, but they provide compile-time type safety. &lt;br&gt;In the code below if generics were covariant it will be possible to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_pollution&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;heap pollution&lt;/a&gt; at line 3.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;    List&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt; dogs = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();\n    List&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt; animals = dogs; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// compile-time error, otherwise heap pollution&lt;/span&gt;\n    animals.add(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Cat&lt;/span&gt;());\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;The answers given here didn&apos;t fully convince me. So instead, I make another example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;passOn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(Consumer&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt; consumer, Supplier&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt; supplier)&lt;/span&gt; {\n    consumer.accept(supplier.get());\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;sounds fine, doesn&apos;t it? But you can only pass &lt;code&gt;Consumer&lt;/code&gt;s and &lt;code&gt;Supplier&lt;/code&gt;s for &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt;s. If you have a &lt;code&gt;Mammal&lt;/code&gt; consumer, but a &lt;code&gt;Duck&lt;/code&gt; supplier, they should not fit although both are animals. In order to disallow this, additional restrictions have been added.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of the above, we have to define relationships between the types we use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;E. g.,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;A &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;passOn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(Consumer&amp;lt;A&amp;gt; consumer, Supplier&amp;lt;? extends A&amp;gt; supplier)&lt;/span&gt; {\n    consumer.accept(supplier.get());\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;makes sure that we can only use a supplier which provides us the right type of object for the consumer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OTOH, we could as well do&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;A &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;passOn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(Consumer&amp;lt;? &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt; A&amp;gt; consumer, Supplier&amp;lt;A&amp;gt; supplier)&lt;/span&gt; {\n    consumer.accept(supplier.get());\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;where we go the other way: we define the type of the &lt;code&gt;Supplier&lt;/code&gt; and restrict that it can be put into the &lt;code&gt;Consumer&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We even can do&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt;A &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;passOn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(Consumer&amp;lt;? &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt; A&amp;gt; consumer, Supplier&amp;lt;? extends A&amp;gt; supplier)&lt;/span&gt; {\n    consumer.accept(supplier.get());\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;where, having the intuitive relations &lt;code&gt;Life&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Mammal&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Dog&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Cat&lt;/code&gt; etc., we could even put a &lt;code&gt;Mammal&lt;/code&gt; into a &lt;code&gt;Life&lt;/code&gt; consumer, but not a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; into a &lt;code&gt;Life&lt;/code&gt; consumer.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;The basis logic for such behavior is that &lt;code&gt;Generics&lt;/code&gt; follow a mechanism of type erasure. So at run time you have no way if identifying the type of &lt;code&gt;collection&lt;/code&gt; unlike &lt;code&gt;arrays&lt;/code&gt; where there is no such erasure process. So coming back to your question...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So suppose there is a method as given below:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;add(List&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt;){\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;//You can add List&amp;lt;Dog or List&amp;lt;Cat&amp;gt; and this will compile as per rules of polymorphism&lt;/span&gt;\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now if java allows caller to add List of type Animal to this method then you might add wrong thing into collection and at run time too it will run due to type erasure. While in case of arrays you will get a run time exception for such scenarios...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus in essence this behavior is implemented so that one cannot add wrong thing into collection. Now  I believe type erasure exists so as to give compatibility with legacy java without generics....&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Actually you can use an interface to achieve what you want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt; {\n    String &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;;\n    String &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;getVoice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;;\n}\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;implements&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;{\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-meta&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt; \n    String &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;getName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;{&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;Dog&quot;&lt;/span&gt;;}\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-meta&quot;&gt;@Override&lt;/span&gt;\n    String &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;getVoice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;{&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;woof!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;;}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;you can then use the collections using&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;List &amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt; animalGroup = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt;();\nanimalGroup.add(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;());\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Subtyping is &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8481301/covariance-invariance-and-contravariance-explained-in-plain-english&quot;&gt;invariant&lt;/a&gt; for parameterized types. Even tough the class &lt;code&gt;Dog&lt;/code&gt; is a subtype of &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt;, the parameterized type &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is not a subtype of &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. In contrast, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8481301/covariance-invariance-and-contravariance-explained-in-plain-english&quot;&gt;covariant&lt;/a&gt; subtyping is used by arrays, so the array\ntype &lt;code&gt;Dog[]&lt;/code&gt; is a subtype of &lt;code&gt;Animal[]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Invariant subtyping ensures that the type constraints enforced by Java are not violated. Consider the following code given by @Jon Skeet:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;List&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt; dogs = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;);\nList&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt; animals = dogs;\nanimals.add(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Cat&lt;/span&gt;()); &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// compile-time error&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-type&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable&quot;&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; dogs.get(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;);\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As stated by @Jon Skeet, this code is illegal, because otherwise it would violate the type constraints by returning a cat when a dog expected.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is instructive to compare the above to analogous code for arrays.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;Dog[] dogs = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;];\nObject[] animals = dogs;\nanimals[&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;] = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Cat&lt;/span&gt;(); &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// run-time error&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-type&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable&quot;&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; dogs[&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;];\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The code is legal. However, throws an &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12369957/dealing-with-an-arraystoreexception&quot;&gt;array store exception&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn array carries its type at run-time this way JVM can enforce\ntype safety of covariant subtyping. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To understand this further let&apos;s look at the bytecode generated by &lt;code&gt;javap&lt;/code&gt; of the class below:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; java.util.ArrayList;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;

Compiler replaced each parameterized type by its &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/313584/what-is-the-concept-of-erasure-in-generics-in-java&quot;&gt;erasure&lt;/a&gt;. This property is crucial meaning that it did not break backwards compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, run-time safety is not possible for parameterized types, since compiler replaces each parameterized type by its erasure. This makes parameterized types are nothing more than syntactic sugar.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;If you are sure that the list items are subclasses of that given super type, you can cast the list using this approach:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;(List&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt;) (List&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;) dogs\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is usefull when you want to pass the list inside of a constructor or iterate over it.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/2745301/4350148&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/a&gt;  as well as other answers are correct. I am  going to add to those answers with a solution that I think will be helpful.  I think this comes up often in programming. One thing to note is that for Collections (Lists, Sets, etc.) the main issue is adding to the Collection. That is where things break down.  Even removing is OK.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In most cases, we can use &lt;code&gt;Collection&amp;lt;? extends T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; rather then &lt;code&gt;Collection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and that should be the first choice.  However, I am finding cases where it is not easy to do that.  It is up for debate as to whether that is always the best thing to do.  I am presenting here a class DownCastCollection that can take convert a &lt;code&gt;Collection&amp;lt;? extends T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to a &lt;code&gt;Collection&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (we can define similar classes for List, Set, NavigableSet,..) to be used when using the standard approach is very inconvenient.  Below is an example of how to use it (we could also use &lt;code&gt;Collection&amp;lt;? extends Object&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in this case, but I am keeping it simple to illustrate using DownCastCollection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;/**Could use Collection&amp;lt;?

A purely functional list is a covariant data functor, which means if a type Sub is a subtype of Super, then a list of Sub is definitely a subtype of a list of Super.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;However mutability of a list is not the basic problem here. The problem is mutability in general. The problem is well known, and is called the Covariance Problem, it was first identified I think by Castagna, and it completely and utterly destroys object orientation as a general paradigm. It is based on previously established variance rules established by Cardelli and Reynolds.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhat oversimplifying, lets consider assignment of an object B of type T to an object A of type T as a mutation. This is without loss of generality: a mutation of A can be written A = f (A) where f: T -&amp;gt; T. The problem, of course, is that whilst functions are covariant in their codomain, they&apos;re contravariant in their domain, but with assignments the domain and codomain are the same, so assignment is invariant!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It follows, generalising, that subtypes cannot be mutated. But with object orientation mutation is fundamental, hence object orientation is intrinsically flawed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s a simple example: in a purely functional setting a symmetric matrix is clearly a matrix, it is a subtype, no problem. Now lets add to matrix the ability to set a single element at coordinates (x,y) with the rule no other element changes. Now symmetric matrix is no longer a subtype, if you change (x,y) you have also changed (y,x). The functional operation is delta: Sym -&amp;gt; Mat, if you change one element of a symmetric matrix you get a general non-symmetric matrix back. Therefore if you included a &quot;change one element&quot; method in Mat, Sym is not a subtype. In fact .. there are almost certainly NO proper subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To put all this in easier terms: if you have a general data type with a wide range of mutators which leverage its generality you can be certain any proper subtype cannot possibly support all those mutations: if it could, it would be just as general as the supertype, contrary to the specification of &quot;proper&quot; subtype.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The fact Java prevents subtyping mutable lists fails to address the real issue: why are you using object oriented rubbish like Java when it was discredited several decades ago??&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In any case there&apos;s a reasonable discussion here:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Lets take the example from JavaSE &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/generics/wildcards.html&quot;

&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;drawAll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(List&amp;lt;Shape&amp;gt; shapes)&lt;/span&gt; {\n   shapes.add(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Rectangle&lt;/span&gt;());    \n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So Java &quot;architects&quot; had 2 options which address this problem:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;do not consider that a subtype is implicitly it&apos;s supertype, and give a compile error, like it happens now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;consider the subtype to be it&apos;s supertype and restrict at compile the &quot;add&quot; method (so in the drawAll method, if a list of circles, subtype of shape, would be passed, the compiler should detected that and restrict you with compile error into doing that).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For obvious reasons, that chose the first way. &lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;We should also take in consideration how the compiler threats the generic classes: in &quot;instantiates&quot; a different type whenever we fill the generic arguments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus we have &lt;code&gt;ListOfAnimal&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ListOfDog&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ListOfCat&lt;/code&gt;, etc, which are distinct classes that end up being &quot;created&quot; by the compiler when we specify the generic arguments. And this is a flat hierarchy (actually regarding to &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; is not a hierarchy at all).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another argument why covariance doesn&apos;t make sense in case of generic classes is the fact that at base all classes are the same - are &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; instances. Specialising a &lt;code&gt;List&lt;/code&gt; by filling the generic argument doesn&apos;t extend the class, it just makes it work for that particular generic argument.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;The problem has been well-identified. But there&apos;s a solution; make &lt;em&gt;doSomething&lt;/em&gt; generic:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;T &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; doSomething&amp;lt;List&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; animals) {\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;now you can call doSomething with either List&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt; or List&amp;lt;Cat&amp;gt; or List&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;another solution is to build a new list&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;List&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt; dogs = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;(); \nList&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt; animals = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt;(dogs);\nanimals.add(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Cat&lt;/span&gt;());\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Further to the answer by Jon Skeet, which uses this example code:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Illegal code - because otherwise life would be Bad&lt;/span&gt;\nList&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt; dogs = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;(); &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// ArrayList implements List&lt;/span&gt;\nList&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt; animals = dogs; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Awooga awooga&lt;/span&gt;\nanimals.add(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Cat&lt;/span&gt;());\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-type&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable&quot;&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; dogs.get(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;); &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// This should be safe, right?&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the deepest level, the problem here is that &lt;code&gt;dogs&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;animals&lt;/code&gt; share a reference. That means that one way to make this work would be to copy the entire list, which would break reference equality:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// This code is fine&lt;/span&gt;\nList&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt; dogs = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;Dog&amp;gt;();\ndogs.add(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;());\nList&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt; animals = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(dogs); &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Copy list&lt;/span&gt;\nanimals.add(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Cat&lt;/span&gt;());\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-type&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable&quot;&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; dogs.get(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;);   &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// This is fine now, because it does not return the Cat&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After calling &lt;code&gt;List&amp;lt;Animal&amp;gt; animals = new ArrayList&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(dogs);&lt;/code&gt;, you cannot subsequently directly assign &lt;code&gt;animals&lt;/code&gt; to either &lt;code&gt;dogs&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;cats&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// These are both illegal&lt;/span&gt;\ndogs = animals;\ncats = animals;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;therefore you can&apos;t put the wrong subtype of &lt;code&gt;Animal&lt;/code&gt; into the list, because there is no wrong subtype -- any object of subtype &lt;code&gt;? extends Animal&lt;/code&gt; can be added to &lt;code&gt;animals&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this changes the semantics, since the lists &lt;code&gt;animals&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dogs&lt;/code&gt; are no longer shared, so adding to one list does not add to the other (which is exactly what you want, to avoid the problem that a &lt;code&gt;Cat&lt;/code&gt; could be added to a list that is only supposed to contain &lt;code&gt;Dog&lt;/code&gt; objects). Also, copying the entire list can be inefficient. However, this does solve the type equivalence problem, by breaking reference equality.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;I see that the question has already been answered a number of times, just want to put in my inputs on the same question.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lets us go ahead and create a simplified Animal class hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;abstract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt; {\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;eat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; {\n        System.out.println(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;animal eating&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);\n    }\n}\n\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt; {\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;bark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; { }\n}\n\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Cat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt; {\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;meow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; { }\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now let us have a look at our old friend Arrays, which we know support polymorphism implicitly-&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;TestAnimals&lt;/span&gt; {\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(String[] args)&lt;/span&gt; {\n        Animal[] animals = {&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;(), &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Cat&lt;/span&gt;(), &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;()};\n        Dog[] dogs = {&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;(), &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;(), &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;()};\n        takeAnimals(animals);\n        takeAnimals(dogs);\n    }\n\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;takeAnimals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(Animal[] animals)&lt;/span&gt; {\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;(Animal a : animals) {\n            System.out.println(a.eat());\n        }\n    }   \n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The class compiles fine and when we run the above class we get the output&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;animal eating\nanimal eating\nanimal eating\nanimal eating\nanimal eating\nanimal eating\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The point to note here is that the takeAnimals() method is defined to take anything which is of type Animal, it can take an array of type Animal and it can take an array of Dog as well because Dog-is-a-Animal. So this is Polymorphism in action.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Let us now use this same approach with generics,&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now say we tweak our code a little bit and use ArrayLists instead of Arrays -&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Dog&lt;/span&gt;());\n        animals.add(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Cat&lt;/span&gt;());\n        animals.add(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Cat&lt;/span&gt;());\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;thinking that this should be doable because ideally it is an Animal ArrayList and you should be in a position to add any cat to it as Cat-is-also-a-Animal, but in real you passed a Dog type ArrayList to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, now you must be thinking the the same should have happened with the Arrays as well. You are right in thinking so.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If somebody tries to do the same thing with Arrays then Arrays are also going to throw an error but Arrays handle this error at runtime whereas ArrayLists handle this error at compile time.&lt;/p&gt;\n    "],"150":["\n&lt;p&gt;No, there is no &quot;previous sibling&quot; selector.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a related note, &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; is for general successor sibling (meaning the element comes after this one, but not necessarily immediately after) and is a CSS3 selector. &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; is for next sibling and is CSS2.1.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#adjacent-sibling-combinators&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Adjacent sibling combinator&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Selectors Level 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html#adjacent-selectors&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;5.7 Adjacent sibling selectors&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/cover.html#minitoc&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Cascading Style Sheets Level 2 Revision 1 (CSS 2.1) Specification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;I found a way to style all previous siblings (opposite of &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;) that may work depending on what you need.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s say you have a list of links and when hovering on one, all the previous ones should turn red.

A previous sibling selector can be simulated in CSS using the flex &lt;code&gt;order&lt;/code&gt; property.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;code&gt;z-index&lt;/code&gt; Myth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another long-standing belief has been that &lt;code&gt;z-index&lt;/code&gt; works only on positioned elements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, the most current version of the spec  the &lt;a href=&quot;https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/visuren.html#propdef-z-index&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;W3C Editor&apos;s Draft&lt;/a&gt;  still asserts this to be true:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/visuren.html#z-index&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.9.1 Specifying the stack level: the &lt;code&gt;z-index&lt;/code&gt;\n  property&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  \n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;z-index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  \n  &lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Value:      auto |  | inherit&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Initial:    auto&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Applies to:      positioned elements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Inherited:      no&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Percentages:    N/A&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Media:      visual&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Computed value:     as specified&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;/ul&gt;\n  \n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(emphasis added)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In reality, however, this information is obsolete and inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Elements that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#painting&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;flex items&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/#z-order&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;grid items&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can create stacking contexts even when &lt;code&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/#painting&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.3. Flex Item Z-Ordering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  \n  &lt;p&gt;Flex items paint exactly the same as inline blocks, except that order-modified document order is used in place of raw \n  document order, and &lt;code&gt;z-index&lt;/code&gt; values other than &lt;code&gt;auto&lt;/code&gt; create a stacking context even if &lt;code&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n  \n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid/#z-order&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.4.

Instead of writing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;default s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-undefined&quot;&gt;x ~ y\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;write &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;default s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-undefined&quot;&gt;y ~ x\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Obviously this matches &quot;x&quot; instead of &quot;y&quot;, but it answers the &quot;is there a match?&quot; question, and simple DOM traversal may get you to the right element more efficiently than looping in javascript.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I realize that the original question was a CSS question so this answer is probably completely irrelevant, but other Javascript users may stumble on the question via search like I did.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s not &quot;previous selector&quot;, but you can use the combination of &lt;code&gt;:not&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; (&quot;after selector&quot;).

It takes the &quot;Cascade&quot; to heart ;-).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, if you are able to add &lt;strong&gt;JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt; to your page, a little bit of &lt;strong&gt;jQuery&lt;/strong&gt; could get you to your end goal.&lt;br&gt;\nYou can use jQuery&apos;s &lt;code&gt;find&lt;/code&gt; to perform a &quot;look-ahead&quot; on your target element/class/id, then backtrack to select your target.&lt;br&gt;\nThen you use jQuery to re-write the DOM (CSS) for your element.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/14469950/5411817&quot;&gt;this answer by Mike Brant&lt;/a&gt;,\nthe following jQuery snippet could help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;default s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;$(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;p + ul&apos;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;prev&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;p&apos;&lt;/span&gt;)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This first selects all &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s that immediately follow a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\nThen it &quot;backtracks&quot; to select all the previous &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s from that set of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Effectively, &quot;previous sibling&quot; has been selected via jQuery.&lt;br&gt;\nNow, use the &lt;code&gt;.css&lt;/code&gt; function to pass in your CSS new values for that element.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In my case I was looking to find a way to select a DIV with the id &lt;code&gt;#full-width&lt;/code&gt;, but ONLY if it had a (indirect) descendant DIV with the class of &lt;code&gt;.companies&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had control of all the HTML under &lt;code&gt;.companies&lt;/code&gt;, but could not alter any of the HTML above it.&lt;br&gt;\nAnd the cascade goes only 1 direction: down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus I could select ALL &lt;code&gt;#full-width&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;br&gt;\nOr I could select &lt;code&gt;.companies&lt;/code&gt; that only followed a &lt;code&gt;#full-width&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\nBut I could &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; select only &lt;code&gt;#full-width&lt;/code&gt;s that &lt;em&gt;proceeded&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;.companies&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And, again, I was unable to add &lt;code&gt;.companies&lt;/code&gt; any higher up in the HTML.  That part of the HTML was written externally, and wrapped our code.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But with jQuery, I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; select the required &lt;code&gt;#full-width&lt;/code&gt;s, then assign the appropriate style:  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;default s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;$(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;#full-width&quot;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;.companies&quot;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;parents&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;#full-width&quot;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;css&lt;/span&gt;( &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;width&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;300px&quot;&lt;/span&gt; );\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This finds all &lt;code&gt;#full-width .companies&lt;/code&gt;, and selects just those &lt;code&gt;.companies&lt;/code&gt;, similar to how selectors are used to target specific elements in standard in CSS.&lt;br&gt;\nThen it uses &lt;code&gt;.parents&lt;/code&gt;
