If you need more security, you should use a certificate signed by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;certificate authority&lt;/a&gt; (CA).&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Am I missing something? Is this the correct way to build a self-signed certificate?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s easy to create a self-signed certificate. You just use the &lt;code&gt;openssl req&lt;/code&gt; command. It can be tricky to create one that can be consumed by the largest selection of clients, like browsers and command line tools.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s difficult because the browsers have their own set of requirements, and they are more restrictive than the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;IETF&lt;/a&gt;. The requirements used by browsers are documented at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cabforum.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;CA/Browser Forums&lt;/a&gt; (see references below). The restrictions arise in two key areas: (1) trust anchors, and (2) DNS names.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Modern browsers (like the warez we&apos;re using in 2014/2015) want a certificate that chains back to a trust anchor, and they want DNS names to be presented in particular ways in the certificate. And browsers are actively moving against self-signed server certificates.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some browsers don&apos;t exactly make it easy to import a self-signed server certificate. In fact, you can&apos;t with some browsers, like Android&apos;s browser. So the complete solution is to become your own authority.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the absence of becoming your own authority, you have to get the DNS names right to give the certificate the greatest chance of success. But I would encourage you to become your own authority. It&apos;s easy to become your own authority, and it will sidestep all the trust issues (who better to trust than yourself?).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is probably not the site you are looking for!&lt;br&gt;\nThe site&apos;s security certificate is not trusted!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is because browsers use a predefined list of trust anchors to validate server certificates. A self-signed certificate does not chain back to a trusted anchor.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid this is:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Create your own authority (i.e., become a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;CA&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Create a certificate signing request (CSR) for the server&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sign the server&apos;s CSR with your CA key&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Install the server certificate on the server&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Install the CA certificate on the client&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Step 1 - &lt;em&gt;Create your own authority&lt;/em&gt; just means to create a self-signed certificate with &lt;code&gt;CA: true&lt;/code&gt; and proper key usage. That means the &lt;em&gt;Subject&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Issuer&lt;/em&gt; are the same entity, CA is set to true in &lt;em&gt;Basic Constraints&lt;/em&gt; (it should also be marked as critical), key usage is &lt;code&gt;keyCertSign&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;crlSign&lt;/code&gt; (if you are using CRLs), and the &lt;em&gt;Subject Key Identifier&lt;/em&gt; (SKI) is the same as the &lt;em&gt;Authority Key Identifier&lt;/em&gt; (AKI).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To become your own certificate authority, see *&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21297139/how-do-you-sign-a-certificate-signing-request-with-your-certification-authority/21340898#21340898&quot;&gt;How do you sign a certificate signing request with your certification authority?&lt;/a&gt; on Stack Overflow. Then, import your CA into the Trust Store used by the browser.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Steps 2 - 4 are roughly what you do now for a public facing server when you enlist the services of a CA like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.startssl.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Startcom&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cacert.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;CAcert&lt;/a&gt;. Steps 1 and 5 allows you to avoid the third-party authority, and act as your own authority (who better to trust than yourself?).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The next best way to avoid the browser warning is to trust the server&apos;s certificate. But some browsers, like Android&apos;s default browser, do not let you do it. So it will never work on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The issue of browsers (and other similar user agents) &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; trusting self-signed certificates is going to be a big problem in the Internet of Things (IoT). For example, what is going to happen when you connect to your thermostat or refrigerator to program it? The answer is, nothing good as far as the user experience is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The W3C&apos;s WebAppSec Working Group is starting to look at the issue.  See, for example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webappsec/2014Dec/0203.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Proposal: Marking HTTP As Non-Secure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How to create a self-signed certificate with OpenSSL&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The commands below and the configuration file create a self-signed certificate (it also shows you how to create a signing request). They differ from other answers in one respect: the DNS names used for the self signed certificate are in the &lt;em&gt;Subject Alternate Name (SAN)&lt;/em&gt;, and not the &lt;em&gt;Common Name (CN)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The DNS names are placed in the SAN through the configuration file with the line &lt;code&gt;subjectAltName = @alternate_names&lt;/code&gt; (there&apos;s no way to do it through the command line). Then there&apos;s an &lt;code&gt;alternate_names&lt;/code&gt; section in the configuration file (you should tune this to suit your taste):&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ alternate_names ]\n\nDNS.1       = example.com\nDNS.2       = www.example.com\nDNS.3       = mail.example.com\nDNS.4       = ftp.example.com\n\n# Add these if you need them. But usually you don&apos;t want them or\n#   need them in production. You may need them for development.\n# DNS.5       = localhost\n# DNS.6       = localhost.localdomain\n# IP.1        = 127.0.0.1\n# IP.2        = ::1\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s important to put DNS name in the SAN and not the CN, because &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; the IETF and the CA/Browser Forums specify the practice. They also specify that DNS names in the CN are deprecated (but not prohibited). &lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; you put a DNS name in the CN, then it &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be included in the SAN under the CA/B policies. So you can&apos;t avoid using the Subject Alternate Name.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&apos;t do put DNS names in the SAN, then the certificate will fail to validate under a browser and other user agents which follow the CA/Browser Forum guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Related: browsers follow the CA/Browser Forum policies; and not the IETF policies. That&apos;s one of the reasons a certificate created with OpenSSL (which generally follows the IETF) sometimes does not validate under a browser (browsers follow the CA/B). They are different standards, they have different issuing policies and different validation requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a self signed certificate&lt;/strong&gt; (notice the addition of &lt;code&gt;-x509&lt;/code&gt; option):&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl req -config example-com.conf -new -x509 -sha256 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \\\n    -keyout example-com.key.pem -days 365 -out example-com.cert.pem\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a signing request&lt;/strong&gt; (notice the lack of &lt;code&gt;-x509&lt;/code&gt; option):&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl req -config example-com.conf -new -sha256 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \\\n    -keyout example-com.key.pem -days 365 -out example-com.req.pem\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Print a self-signed certificate&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl x509 -in example-com.cert.pem -text -noout\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Print a signing request&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl req -in example-com.req.pem -text -noout\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configuration file (passed via &lt;code&gt;-config&lt;/code&gt; option)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ req ]\ndefault_bits        = 2048\ndefault_keyfile     = server-key.pem\ndistinguished_name  = subject\nreq_extensions      = req_ext\nx509_extensions     = x509_ext\nstring_mask         = utf8only\n\n# The Subject DN can be formed using X501 or RFC 4514 (see RFC 4519 for a description).\n#   Its sort of a mashup.

There is &lt;strong&gt;no interactive input&lt;/strong&gt; that annoys you. There are &lt;strong&gt;no config files&lt;/strong&gt; you have to mess around with. All necessary steps are executed by a &lt;strong&gt;single OpenSSL invocation&lt;/strong&gt;: from private key generation up to the self-signed certificate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Remark #1: Crypto parameters&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since the certificate is self-signed and needs to be accepted by users manually, it doesn&apos;t make sense to use a short expiration or weak cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the future, you might want to use more than &lt;code&gt;4096&lt;/code&gt; bits for the RSA key and a hash algorithm stronger than &lt;code&gt;sha256&lt;/code&gt;, but as of 2022 these are sane values. They are sufficiently strong while being supported by all modern browsers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Remark #2: Parameter &quot;&lt;code&gt;-nodes&lt;/code&gt;&quot;&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Theoretically you could leave out the &lt;code&gt;-nodes&lt;/code&gt; parameter (which means &quot;no DES encryption&quot;), in which case &lt;code&gt;example.key&lt;/code&gt; would be encrypted with a password. However, this is almost never useful for a server installation, because you would either have to store the password on the server as well, or you&apos;d have to enter it manually on each reboot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;Remark #3: See also&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://security.stackexchange.com/a/198409/133603&quot;&gt;Provide subjectAltName to openssl directly on command line&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/333325/20407&quot;&gt;How to add multiple email addresses to an SSL certificate via the command line?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/34386471/19163&quot;&gt;More information about MSYS_NO_PATHCONV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Here are the options described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/a/10176685/456814&quot;&gt;@diegows&apos;s answer&lt;/a&gt;, described in more detail, from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/req.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;the documentation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days XXX\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;req\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n  \n  &lt;p&gt;PKCS#10 certificate request and certificate generating utility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-x509\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n  \n  &lt;p&gt;this option outputs a self signed certificate instead of a certificate request.\n  This is typically used to generate a test certificate or a self signed root CA.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;-newkey arg\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n  \n  &lt;p&gt;this option creates a new certificate request and a new private key.

And my solution was to create a Root certificate and signed a child certificate by it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So step by step.\nCreate file &lt;strong&gt;config_ssl_ca.cnf&lt;/strong&gt;\nNotice, config file has an option &lt;strong&gt;basicConstraints=CA:true&lt;/strong&gt; which means that this certificate is supposed to be root.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a good practice, because you create it once and can reuse.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ req ]\ndefault_bits = 2048\n\nprompt = no\ndistinguished_name=req_distinguished_name\nreq_extensions = v3_req\n\n[ req_distinguished_name ]\ncountryName=UA\nstateOrProvinceName=root region\nlocalityName=root city\norganizationName=Market(localhost)\norganizationalUnitName=roote department\ncommonName=market.localhost\nemailAddress=root_email@root.localhost\n\n[ alternate_names ]\nDNS.1        = market.localhost\nDNS.2        = www.market.localhost\nDNS.3        = mail.market.localhost\nDNS.4        = ftp.market.localhost\nDNS.5        = *.market.localhost\n\n[ v3_req ]\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nbasicConstraints=CA:true\nsubjectKeyIdentifier = hash\nsubjectAltName = @alternate_names\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Next config file for your child certificate will be call &lt;strong&gt;config_ssl.cnf&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ req ]\ndefault_bits = 2048\n\nprompt = no\ndistinguished_name=req_distinguished_name\nreq_extensions = v3_req\n\n[ req_distinguished_name ]\ncountryName=UA\nstateOrProvinceName=Kyiv region\nlocalityName=Kyiv\norganizationName=market place\norganizationalUnitName=market place department\ncommonName=market.localhost\nemailAddress=email@market.localhost\n\n[ alternate_names ]\nDNS.1        = market.localhost\nDNS.2        = www.market.localhost\nDNS.3        = mail.market.localhost\nDNS.4        = ftp.market.localhost\nDNS.5        = *.market.localhost\n\n[ v3_req ]\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nbasicConstraints=CA:false\nsubjectAltName = @alternate_names\nsubjectKeyIdentifier = hash\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The first step - create Root key and certificate&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048\nopenssl req -new -x509 -key ca.key -out ca.crt -days 365 -config config_ssl_ca.cnf\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The second step creates child key and file CSR - Certificate Signing Request. Because the idea is to sign the child certificate by root and get a correct certificate&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl genrsa -out market.key 2048\nopenssl req -new -sha256 -key market.key -config config_ssl.cnf -out market.csr\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Open Linux terminal and do this command&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo 00 &amp;gt; ca.srl\ntouch index.txt\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;ca.srl&lt;/strong&gt; text file containing the next serial number to use in hex.\nMandatory.  This file must be present and contain a valid serial number.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Last Step, create one more config file and call it &lt;strong&gt;config_ca.cnf&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# we use &apos;ca&apos; as the default section because we&apos;re usign the ca command\n[ ca ]\ndefault_ca = my_ca\n\n[ my_ca ]\n#  a text file containing the next serial number to use in hex.

The answer is simple because child certificate must have a SAN block - Subject Alternative Names.\nIf we sign the child certificate by &quot;openssl x509&quot; utils, the Root certificate will delete the SAN field in child certificate.\nSo we use &quot;openssl ca&quot; instead of &quot;openssl x509&quot; to avoid the deleting of the SAN field. We create a new config file and tell it to copy all extended fields &lt;strong&gt;copy_extensions = copy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl ca -config config_ca.cnf -out market.crt -in market.csr\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The program asks you 2 questions:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Sign the certificate? Say &quot;Y&quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;1 out of 1 certificate requests certified, commit? Say &quot;Y&quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In terminal you can see a sentence with the word &quot;Database&quot;, it means file index.txt which you create by the command &quot;touch&quot;. It will contain all information by all certificates you create by &quot;openssl ca&quot; util.\nTo check the certificate valid use:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl rsa -in market.key -check\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to see what inside in CRT:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl x509 -in market.crt -text -noout\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to see what inside in CSR:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl req -in market.csr -noout -text \n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;This is the script I use on local boxes to set the SAN (subjectAltName) in self-signed certificates. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This script takes the domain name (example.com) and generates the SAN for *.example.com and example.com in the same certificate.

This way you can set the parameters and run the command, get your output - then go for coffee.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scaleup.us/2017/09/10/create-self-signed-tls-certificates-pkcs8-key-x509-cert-graylog-gelf/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; More here &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl&lt;/code&gt; allows to generate self-signed certificate by a single command (&lt;code&gt;-newkey&lt;/code&gt;\ninstructs to generate a private key and &lt;code&gt;-x509&lt;/code&gt; instructs to issue a self-signed\ncertificate instead of a signing request)::&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 \\\n-keyout my.key -passout pass:123456 -out my.crt \\\n-days 365 \\\n-subj /CN=localhost/O=home/C=US/emailAddress=me@mail.internal \\\n-addext &quot;subjectAltName = DNS:localhost,DNS:web.internal,email:me@mail.internal&quot; \\\n-addext keyUsage=digitalSignature -addext extendedKeyUsage=serverAuth\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can generate a private key and construct a self-signing certificate in separate steps::&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl genrsa -out my.key -passout pass:123456 2048\n\nopenssl req -x509 \\\n-key my.key -passin pass:123456 -out my.csr \\\n-days 3650 \\\n-subj /CN=localhost/O=home/C=US/emailAddress=me@mail.internal \\\n-addext &quot;subjectAltName = DNS:localhost,DNS:web.internal,email:me@mail.internal&quot; \\\n-addext keyUsage=digitalSignature -addext extendedKeyUsage=serverAuth\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Review the resulting certificate::&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl x509 -text -noout -in my.crt\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Java &lt;code&gt;keytool&lt;/code&gt; creates PKCS#12 store::&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;keytool -genkeypair -keystore my.p12 -alias master \\\n-storetype pkcs12 -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 3650 \\\n-storepass 123456 \\\n-dname &quot;CN=localhost,O=home,C=US&quot; \\\n-ext &apos;san=dns:localhost,dns:web.internal,email:me@mail.internal&apos;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To export the self-signed certificate::&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;keytool -exportcert -keystore my.p12 -file my.crt \\\n-alias master -rfc -storepass 123456\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Review the resulting certificate::&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;keytool -printcert -file my.crt\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;certtool&lt;/code&gt; from GnuTLS doesn&apos;t allow passing different attributes from CLI.

That cost is easy to justify if you are processing credit card payments or work for the profit center of a highly profitable company. It is more than many can afford for a personal project one is creating on the internet, or for a non-profit running on a minimal budget, or if one works in a cost center of an organization -- cost centers always try to do more with less.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An alternative is to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://certbot.eff.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;certbot&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://certbot.eff.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;about certbot&lt;/a&gt;). Certbot is an easy-to-use automatic client that fetches and deploys SSL/TLS certificates for your web server.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you setup certbot, you can enable it to create and maintain a certificate for you issued by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lets Encrypt&lt;/a&gt; certificate authority.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did this over the weekend for my organization. I installed the required packages for certbot on my server (Ubuntu 16.04) and then ran the command necessary to setup and enable certbot. One likely needs a &lt;a href=&quot;https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#dns-plugins&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;DNS plugin&lt;/a&gt; for certbot - we are presently using &lt;a href=&quot;https://certbot-dns-digitalocean.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;DigitalOcean&lt;/a&gt; though may be migrating to another service soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that some of the instructions were not quite right and took a little poking and time with Google to figure out. This took a fair amount of my time the first time but now I think I could do it in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For DigitalOcean, one area I struggled was when I was prompted to input the path to your DigitalOcean credentials INI file. What the script is referring to is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Applications &amp;amp; API&lt;/a&gt; page and the Tokens/Key tab on that page. You need to have or generate a personal access token (read and write) for DigitalOcean&apos;s API -- this is a 65 character hexadecimal string. This string then needs to be put into a file on the webserver from which you are running certbot. That file can have a comment as its first line (comments start with #). The seccond line is:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;dns_digitalocean_token = 0000111122223333444455556666777788889999aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once I figured out how to set up a read+write token for DigitalOcean&apos;s API, it was pretty easy to use certbot to setup a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_certificate&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;wildcard certificate&lt;/a&gt;. Note that one does not have to setup a wildcard certificate, one may instead specify each domain and sub-domain that one wants the certificate to appply to. It was the wildcard certificate that required the credentials INI file that contained the personal access token from DigitalOcean.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that public key certificates (also known as identity certificates or SSL certificates) expire and require renewal. Thus you will need to renew your certificate on a periodic (reoccurring) basis. The certbot documentation covers &lt;a href=&quot;https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#renewing-certificates&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;renewing certificates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My plan is to write a script to use the openssl command to get my certificate&apos;s expiration date and to trigger renewal when it is 30 days or less until it expires. I will then add this script to cron and run it once per day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is the command to read your certificate&apos;s expiration date:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@prod-host:~# /usr/bin/openssl x509 -enddate -noout -in path-to-certificate-pem-file\nnotAfter=May 25 19:24:12 2019 GMT\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;this worked for me&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;openssl req -x509 -nodes -subj &apos;/CN=localhost&apos;

jQuery should handle &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.jquery.com/resize/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;zoom/pinch&lt;/a&gt; cross browser, otherwise &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/995914/catch-browsers-zoom-event-in-javascript&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11183174/simplest-way-to-detect-a-pinch&quot;&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; link should help you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;strong&gt;modify DOM&lt;/strong&gt;, it can affect the element&apos;s visibility. You should take control over that and call &lt;code&gt;handler()&lt;/code&gt; manually. Unfortunately, we don&apos;t have any cross browser &lt;code&gt;onrepaint&lt;/code&gt; event. On the other hand that allows us to make optimizations and perform re-check only on DOM modifications that can change an element&apos;s visibility.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Ever&lt;/strong&gt; use it inside jQuery &lt;a href=&quot;http://api.jquery.com/ready/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;$(document).ready()&lt;/a&gt; only, because &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1324568/is-document-ready-also-css-ready&quot;&gt;there is no warranty CSS has been applied&lt;/a&gt; in this moment. Your code can work locally with your CSS on a hard drive, but once put on a remote server it will fail.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After &lt;code&gt;DOMContentLoaded&lt;/code&gt; is fired, &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3520780/when-is-window-onload-fired&quot;&gt;styles are applied&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8835413/difference-between-load-vs-domcontentloaded&quot;&gt;the images are not loaded yet&lt;/a&gt;. So, we should add &lt;code&gt;window.onload&lt;/code&gt; event listener.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We can&apos;t catch zoom/pinch event yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The last resort could be the following code:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;default s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-scss&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;/* &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-doctag&quot;&gt;TODO:&lt;/span&gt;

Some of these issues are pointed out in his answer near the bottom, that his code will give false positives for elements that are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hidden by another element in front of the one being tested&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Outside the visible area of a parent or ancestor element&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;An element or its children hidden by using the CSS &lt;code&gt;clip&lt;/code&gt; property&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These limitations are demonstrated in the following results of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jsfiddle.net/AndyE/d48Cv/1&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;simple test&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/xdo9l.png&quot;

alt=&quot;Passed test, using isElementVisible&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Additional notes&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This method is not without its own limitations, however. For instance, an element being tested with a lower z-index than another element at the same location would be identified as hidden even if the element in front doesn&apos;t actually hide any part of it.  Still, this method has its uses in some cases that Dan&apos;s solution doesn&apos;t cover.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;code&gt;element.getBoundingClientRect()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;document.elementFromPoint()&lt;/code&gt; are part of the CSSOM Working Draft specification and are supported in at least IE 6 and later and &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; desktop browsers for a long time (albeit, not perfectly). See &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_cssom.html#documentview&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Quirksmode on these functions&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;contains()&lt;/code&gt; is used to see if the element returned by &lt;code&gt;document.elementFromPoint()&lt;/code&gt; is a child node of the element we&apos;re testing for visibility.  It also returns true if the element returned is the same element.  This just makes the check more robust.  It&apos;s supported in all major browsers, Firefox 9.0 being the last of them to add it.  For older Firefox support, check this answer&apos;s history.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to test more points around the element for visibilityie, to make sure the element isn&apos;t covered by more than, say, 50%it wouldn&apos;t take much to adjust the last part of the answer.  However, be aware that it would probably be very slow if you checked every pixel to make sure it was 100% visible.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;I tried &lt;a href=&quot;/a/7557433/315024&quot;&gt;Dan&apos;s answer&lt;/a&gt;, however, the algebra used to determine the bounds means that the element must be both  the viewport size and completely inside the viewport to get &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, easily leading to false negatives. If you want to determine whether an element is in the viewport at all, &lt;a href=&quot;/a/12418814/315024&quot;&gt;ryanve&apos;s answer&lt;/a&gt; is close but the element being tested should overlap the viewport, so try this:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;default s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;isElementInViewport&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;el&lt;/span&gt;) {\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; rect = el.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;getBoundingClientRect&lt;/span&gt;();\n\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; rect.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;&amp;amp;\n        rect.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;&amp;amp;\n        rect.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable language_&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;innerWidth&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable language_&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;documentElement&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;clientWidth&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;/* or $(window).width() */&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;&amp;amp;\n        rect.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable language_&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;innerHeight&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable language_&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;documentElement&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;clientHeight&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;/* or $(window).height() */&lt;/span&gt;;\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;See the source of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ryanve/verge#verge&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;verge&lt;/a&gt;, which uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/element.getBoundingClientRect&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;getBoundingClientRect&lt;/a&gt;.

and only has to be written once for it to work (you don&apos;t have to write it out for each element that you want to know is in the viewport).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This code only checks to see if it is vertically in the viewport, &lt;strong&gt;not horizontally&lt;/strong&gt;. In this case, the variable (array) &apos;elements&apos; holds all the elements that you are checking to be vertically in the viewport, so grab any elements you want anywhere and store them there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &apos;for loop&apos;, loops through each element and checks to see if it is vertically in the viewport. This code executes &lt;strong&gt;every time&lt;/strong&gt; the user scrolls! If the getBoudingClientRect().top is less than 3/4 the viewport (the element is one quarter in the viewport), it registers as &apos;in the viewport&apos;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the code is generic, you will want to know &apos;which&apos; element is in the viewport. To find that out, you can determine it by custom attribute, node name, id, class name, and more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is my code (tell me if it doesn&apos;t work; it has been tested in Internet&amp;nbsp;Explorer&amp;nbsp;11, Firefox 40.0.3, Chrome Version 45.0.2454.85 m, Opera 31.0.1889.174, and Edge with Windows 10, [not Safari yet])...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;default s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Scrolling handlers...&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable language_&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;onscroll&lt;/span&gt;

For example, if only half of an image is visible at the bottom of the view, the solutions here will fail, considering that &quot;outside&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a use case where I&apos;m doing lazy loading via &lt;code&gt;IntersectionObserver&lt;/code&gt;, but due to animations that occur during pop-in, I didn&apos;t want to observe any images that were &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; intersected on page load. To do that, I used the following code:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;default s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; bounding = el.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;getBoundingClientRect&lt;/span&gt;();\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; isVisible = (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; bounding.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; bounding.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable language_&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;innerHeight&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable language_&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;documentElement&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;clientHeight&lt;/span&gt;)) ||\n        (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; bounding.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; bounding.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; (&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable language_&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;innerHeight&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable language_&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;documentElement&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;clientHeight&lt;/span&gt;));\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is basically checking to see if either the top or bottom bound is independently in the viewport. The opposite end may be outside, but as long as one end is in, it&apos;s &quot;visible&quot; at least partially.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/E8ETh.png&quot;

is close to correct.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Many examples use &quot;completely contained in the viewport&quot; and his code uses percentages to allow for partially visible.  His code also addresses the &quot;is a parent clipping the view&quot; question, which most examples ignore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One missing element is the impact of the parent&apos;s scrollbars - &lt;code&gt;getBoundingClientRect&lt;/code&gt; returns the outer rectangle of the parent, which includes the scroll bars, not the inner rectangle, which doesn&apos;t.  A child can hide behind the parent scroll bar and be considered visible when it isn&apos;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The recommended observer pattern isn&apos;t appropriate for my use case: using the arrow keys to change the currently selected row in a table, and make sure the new selection is visible.  Using an observer for this would be excessively convoluted.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s some code -&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;it includes an additional hack (&lt;code&gt;fudgeY&lt;/code&gt;) because my table has a sticky header that isn&apos;t detectable by straightforward means (and handling this automatically would be pretty tedious).  Also, it uses decimal (0 to 1) instead of percentage for the required visible fraction.  (For my case I need full y, and x isn&apos;t relevant).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;intersectRect&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;r1, r2&lt;/span&gt;) {\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; r = {};\n    r.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt; = r1.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; r2.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt; ? r2.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt; : r1.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;;\n    r.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt; = r1.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; r2.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt; ? r2.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt; : r1.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;;\n    r.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt; = r1.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; r2.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt; ? r1.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt; : r2.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;;\n    r.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt; = r1.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; r2.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt; ? r1.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt; : r2.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt;;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (r.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; r.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; r.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; r.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt;)\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; r;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;;\n}\n\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;innerRect&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;) {\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; b,r;\n    b = e.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;getBoundingClientRect&lt;/span&gt;();\n    r = {};\n    r.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt; = b.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;;\n    r.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt; = b.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;;\n    r.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt; = b.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt; + e.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;clientWidth&lt;/span&gt;;\n    r.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt; = b.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt; + e.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;clientHeight&lt;/span&gt;;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; r;\n}\n\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;isViewable&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;e, fracX, fracY, fudgeY&lt;/span&gt;) {\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// ref https://stackoverflow.com/a/37998526&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// intersect all the rects and then check the result once&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// innerRect: mind the scroll bars&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// fudgeY: handle &quot;sticky&quot; thead in parent table.

The stack typically lives at the &lt;strong&gt;upper&lt;/strong&gt; end of your address space and as it is used up it heads towards the &lt;strong&gt;bottom&lt;/strong&gt; of the address space (i.e. towards zero).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your process also has a &lt;strong&gt;heap&lt;/strong&gt;, which lives at the &lt;strong&gt;bottom&lt;/strong&gt; end of your process. As you allocate memory, this heap can grow towards the upper end of your address space. As you can see, there is a potential for the heap to &lt;strong&gt;&quot;collide&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; with the stack (a bit like tectonic plates!!!).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The common cause for a stack overflow is a &lt;strong&gt;bad recursive call&lt;/strong&gt;. Typically, this is caused when your recursive functions doesn&apos;t have the correct termination condition, so it ends up calling itself forever. Or when the termination condition is fine, it can be caused by requiring too many recursive calls before fulfilling it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, with GUI programming, it&apos;s possible to generate &lt;strong&gt;indirect recursion&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, your app may be handling paint messages, and, whilst processing them, it may call a function that causes the system to send another paint message. Here you&apos;ve not explicitly called yourself, but the OS/VM has done it for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To deal with them, you&apos;ll need to examine your code. If you&apos;ve got functions that call themselves then check that you&apos;ve got a terminating condition. If you have, then check that when calling the function you have at least modified one of the arguments, otherwise there&apos;ll be no visible change for the recursively called function and the terminating condition is useless. Also mind that your stack space can run out of memory before reaching a valid terminating condition, thus make sure your method can handle input values requiring more recursive calls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&apos;ve got no obvious recursive functions then check to see if you&apos;re calling any library functions that &lt;strong&gt;indirectly&lt;/strong&gt; will cause your function to be called (like the implicit case above).&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;To describe this, first let us understand how &lt;strong&gt;local&lt;/strong&gt; variables and objects are stored.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Local variable are stored on the &lt;strong&gt;stack&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/SHTah.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you looked at the image you should be able to understand how things are working.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When a function call is invoked by a Java application, a stack frame is allocated on the call stack. The stack frame contains the parameters of the invoked method, its local parameters, and the return address of the method. The return address denotes the execution point from which, the program execution shall continue after the invoked method returns. If there is no space for a new stack frame then, the &lt;code&gt;StackOverflowError&lt;/code&gt; is thrown by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The most common case that can possibly exhaust a Java applications stack is recursion. In recursion, a method invokes itself during its execution. Recursion is considered as a powerful general-purpose programming technique, but it must be used with caution, to avoid &lt;code&gt;StackOverflowError&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An example of throwing a &lt;code&gt;StackOverflowError&lt;/code&gt; is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;StackOverflowErrorExample.java:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;StackOverflowErrorExample&lt;/span&gt; {\n\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;recursivePrint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-type&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; num)&lt;/span&gt; {\n        System.out.println(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;Number: &quot;&lt;/span&gt; + num);\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (num == &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;)\n            &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;;\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;\n            recursivePrint(++num);\n        }\n\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(String[] args)&lt;/span&gt; {\n        StackOverflowErrorExample.recursivePrint(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;);\n    }\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this example, we define a recursive method, called &lt;code&gt;recursivePrint&lt;/code&gt; that prints an integer and then, calls itself, with the next successive integer as an argument. The recursion ends until we pass in &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; as a parameter. However, in our example, we passed in the parameter from 1 and its increasing followers, consequently, the recursion will never terminate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A sample execution, using the &lt;code&gt;-Xss1M&lt;/code&gt; flag that specifies the size of the thread stack to equal to 1&amp;nbsp;MB, is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-html s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-xml&quot;&gt;Number: 1\nNumber: 2\nNumber: 3\n...\nNumber: 6262\nNumber: 6263\nNumber: 6264\nNumber: 6265\nNumber: 6266\nException in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.StackOverflowError\n        at java.io.PrintStream.write(PrintStream.java:480)\n        at sun.nio.cs.StreamEncoder.writeBytes(StreamEncoder.java:221)\n        at sun.nio.cs.StreamEncoder.implFlushBuffer(StreamEncoder.java:291)\n        at sun.nio.cs.StreamEncoder.flushBuffer(StreamEncoder.java:104)\n        at java.io.OutputStreamWriter.flushBuffer(OutputStreamWriter.java:185)\n        at java.io.PrintStream.write(PrintStream.java:527)\n        at java.io.PrintStream.print(PrintStream.java:669)\n        at java.io.PrintStream.println(PrintStream.java:806)\n        at StackOverflowErrorExample.recursivePrint(StackOverflowErrorExample.java:4)\n        at StackOverflowErrorExample.recursivePrint(StackOverflowErrorExample.java:9)\n        at StackOverflowErrorExample.recursivePrint(StackOverflowErrorExample.java:9)\n        at StackOverflowErrorExample.recursivePrint(StackOverflowErrorExample.java:9)\n        ...\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Depending on the JVMs initial configuration, the results may differ, but eventually the &lt;code&gt;StackOverflowError&lt;/code&gt; shall be thrown. This example is a very good example of how recursion can cause problems, if not implemented with caution.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to deal with the StackOverflowError&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simplest solution is to carefully inspect the stack trace and\ndetect the repeating pattern of line numbers. These line numbers\nindicate the code being recursively called. Once you detect these\nlines, you must carefully inspect your code and understand why the\nrecursion never terminates.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have verified that the recursion\nis implemented correctly, you can increase the stacks size, in\norder to allow a larger number of invocations. Depending on the Java\nVirtual Machine (JVM) installed, the default thread stack size may\nequal to either &lt;strong&gt;512&amp;nbsp;KB, or 1&amp;nbsp;MB&lt;/strong&gt;. You can increase the thread stack\nsize using the &lt;code&gt;-Xss&lt;/code&gt; flag. This flag can be specified either via the\nprojects configuration, or via the command line. The format of the\n&lt;code&gt;-Xss&lt;/code&gt; argument is:\n&lt;code&gt;-Xss&amp;lt;size&amp;gt;[g|G|m|M|k|K]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;If you have a function like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-type&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;\n{\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// more stuff&lt;/span&gt;\n    foo();\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then foo() will keep calling itself, getting deeper and deeper, and when the space used to keep track of what functions you&apos;re in is filled up, you get the stack overflow error.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Stack overflow means exactly that: a stack overflows. Usually there&apos;s a one stack in the program that contains local-scope variables and addresses where to return when execution of a routine ends. That stack tends to be a fixed memory range somewhere in the memory, therefore it&apos;s limited how much it can contain values.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the stack is empty you can&apos;t pop, if you do you&apos;ll get stack underflow error.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the stack is full you can&apos;t push, if you do you&apos;ll get stack overflow error.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So stack overflow appears where you allocate too much into the stack. For instance, in the mentioned recursion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some implementations optimize out some forms of recursions. Tail recursion in particular. Tail recursive routines are form of routines where the recursive call appears as a final thing what the routine does. Such routine call gets simply reduced into a jump.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some implementations go so far as implement their own stacks for recursion, therefore they allow the recursion to continue until the system runs out of memory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Easiest thing you could try would be to increase your stack size if you can. If you can&apos;t do that though, the second best thing would be to look whether there&apos;s something that clearly causes the stack overflow. Try it by printing something before and after the call into routine. This helps you to find out the failing routine.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;A stack overflow is usually called by nesting function calls too deeply (especially easy when using recursion, i.e. a function that calls itself) or allocating a large amount of memory on the stack where using the heap would be more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Like you say, you need to show some code. :-)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A stack overflow error usually happens when your function calls nest too deeply. See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62188/stack-overflow-code-golf-closed&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow Code Golf&lt;/a&gt; thread for some examples of how this happens (though in the case of that question, the answers intentionally cause stack overflow).&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;StackOverflowError&lt;/code&gt; is to the stack as &lt;code&gt;OutOfMemoryError&lt;/code&gt; is to the heap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unbounded recursive calls result in stack space being used up. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The following example produces &lt;code&gt;StackOverflowError&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;StackOverflowDemo&lt;/span&gt;\n{\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;unboundedRecursiveCall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; {\n     unboundedRecursiveCall();\n    }\n\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(String[] args)&lt;/span&gt; \n    {\n        unboundedRecursiveCall();\n    }\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;StackOverflowError&lt;/code&gt; is avoidable if recursive calls are bounded to prevent the aggregate total of incomplete in-memory calls (in bytes) from exceeding the stack size (in bytes).&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;The most common cause of stack overflows is &lt;strong&gt;excessively deep or infinite recursion&lt;/strong&gt;. If this is your problem, &lt;a href=&quot;http://danzig.jct.ac.il/java_class/recursion.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;this tutorial about Java Recursion&lt;/a&gt; could help understand the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;StackOverflowError&lt;/code&gt; is a runtime error in Java.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is thrown when the amount of call stack memory allocated by the JVM is exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A common case of a &lt;code&gt;StackOverflowError&lt;/code&gt; being thrown, is when the call stack exceeds due to excessive deep or infinite recursion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Factorial&lt;/span&gt; {\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-type&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-type&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; n)&lt;/span&gt;{\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;(n == &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;){\n            &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;;\n        }\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;{\n            &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; n * factorial(n-&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;);\n        }\n    }\n\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(String[] args)&lt;/span&gt;{\n         System.out.println(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;Main method started&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-type&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Factorial.factorial(-&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;);\n        System.out.println(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;Factorial ==&amp;gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;+result);\n        System.out.println(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;Main method ended&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);\n    }\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stack trace:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-none s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Main method started\nException in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.StackOverflowError\nat com.program.stackoverflow.Factorial.factorial(Factorial.java:9)\nat com.program.stackoverflow.Factorial.factorial(Factorial.java:9)\nat com.program.stackoverflow.Factorial.factorial(Factorial.java:9)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the above case, it can be avoided by doing programmatic changes.\nBut if the program logic is correct and it still occurs then your stack size needs to be increased.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of a recursive algorithm for reversing a singly linked list. On a laptop (with the specifications 4&amp;nbsp;GB memory, Intel &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core#Core_i5&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Core&amp;nbsp;i5&lt;/a&gt; 2.3&amp;nbsp;GHz CPU 64 bit and Windows 7), this function will run into StackOverflow error for a linked list of size close to 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My point is that we should use recursion judiciously, always taking into account of the scale of the system.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Often recursion can be converted to iterative program, which scales better. (One iterative version of the same algorithm is given at the bottom of the page. It reverses a singly linked list of size 1 million in 9 milliseconds.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; LinkedListNode &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;doReverseRecursively&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(LinkedListNode x, LinkedListNode first)&lt;/span&gt;{\n\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-type&quot;&gt;LinkedListNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable&quot;&gt;second&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; first.next;\n\n    first.next = x;\n\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;(second != &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;){\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; doReverseRecursively(first, second);\n    }&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;{\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; first;\n    }\n}\n\n\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; LinkedListNode &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;reverseRecursively&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(LinkedListNode head)&lt;/span&gt;{\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; doReverseRecursively(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;, head);\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iterative Version of the Same Algorithm:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; LinkedListNode &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;reverseIteratively&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(LinkedListNode head)&lt;/span&gt;{\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; doReverseIteratively(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;, head);\n}\n\n\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; LinkedListNode &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;doReverseIteratively&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(LinkedListNode x, LinkedListNode first)&lt;/span&gt; {\n\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; (first != &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;) {\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-type&quot;&gt;LinkedListNode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable&quot;&gt;second&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; first.next;\n        first.next = x;\n        x = first;\n\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (second == &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;) {\n            &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;;\n        } &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; {\n            first = second;\n        }\n    }\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; first;\n}\n\n\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; LinkedListNode &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;reverseIteratively&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(LinkedListNode head)&lt;/span&gt;{\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; doReverseIteratively(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;, head);\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;The stack has a space limit that depends on the operating system. The normal size is 8&amp;nbsp;MB (in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_%28operating_system%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; (Linux), you can check that limit with &lt;code&gt;$ ulimit -u&lt;/code&gt; and it can be checked in other OS similarly). Any program makes use of the stack at runtime, but to fully know when it is used you need to check the assembly language. In x86_64 for example, the stack is used to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Save the return address when making a procedure call&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Save local variables&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Save special registers to restore them later&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pass arguments to a procedure call (more than 6)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Other: random unused stack base, canary values, padding, ... etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&apos;t know x86_64 (normal case) you only need to know when the specific high-level programming language you are using compile to those actions. For example in C:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;(1)  a function call&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;(2)  local variables in function calls (including main)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;(3)  local variables in function calls (not main)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;(4)  a function call&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;(5)  normally a function call, it is generally irrelevant for a stack overflow.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, in C, &lt;strong&gt;only local variables and function calls make use of the stack&lt;/strong&gt;. The two (unique?) ways of making a stack overflow are:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Declaring too large local variables in main or in any function that it&apos;s called in (&lt;code&gt;int array[10000][10000];&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A very deep or infinite recursion (too many function calls at the same time).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To avoid a &lt;code&gt;StackOverflowError&lt;/code&gt; you can:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;check if local variables are too big (order of 1 MB)  use the heap (malloc/calloc calls) or global variables.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;check for infinite recursion  you know what to do... correct it!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;check for normal too deep recursion  the easiest approach is to just change the implementation to be iterative.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Notice also that global variables, include libraries, etc... don&apos;t make use of the stack.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Only if the above does not work, change the stack size to the maximum on the specific OS. With Ubuntu for example: &lt;code&gt;ulimit -s 32768&lt;/code&gt; (32 MB). (This has never been the solution for any of my stack overflow errors, but I also don&apos;t have much experience.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have omitted special and/or not standard cases in C (such as usage of &lt;code&gt;alloc()&lt;/code&gt; and similar) because if you are using them you should already know exactly what you are doing.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;In a crunch, the below situation will bring a stack overflow error.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Example3&lt;/span&gt; {\n\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(String[] args)&lt;/span&gt; {\n\n        main(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]);\n    }\n\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;A simple Java example that causes java.lang.StackOverflowError because of a bad recursive call:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Human&lt;/span&gt; {\n    Human(){\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;();\n    }\n}\n\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Human&lt;/span&gt; {\n    Animal(){\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;();\n    }\n}\n\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Test01&lt;/span&gt; {\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(String[] args)&lt;/span&gt; {\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title class_&quot;&gt;Animal&lt;/span&gt;();\n    }\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s an example&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-java s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(String[] args)&lt;/span&gt; {\n    System.out.println(add5(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;));\n}\n\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-type&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;add5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-type&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; a)&lt;/span&gt; {\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; add5(a) + &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;;\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A StackOverflowError basically is when you try to do something, that most likely calls itself, and goes on for infinity (or until it gives a StackOverflowError).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;add5(a)&lt;/code&gt; will call itself, and then call itself again, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;This is a typical case of &lt;code&gt;java.lang.StackOverflowError&lt;/code&gt;...
