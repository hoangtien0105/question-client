To avoid problems in my own code, I follow another good practice regarding &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;em&gt;don&apos;t&lt;/em&gt; use them to denote imaginary numbers. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/i.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;MATLAB&apos;s own documentation states&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For speed and improved robustness, you can replace complex &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;1i&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So rather than avoiding two very commonly used variable names because of a potential conflict, I&apos;m explicit about imaginary numbers. It also makes my code more clear. Anytime I see &lt;code&gt;1i&lt;/code&gt;, I know that it represents &lt;code&gt;sqrt(-1)&lt;/code&gt; because it could not possibly be a variable.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;In old versions of MATLAB, there used to be a good reason to avoid the use of &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; as variable names - early versions of the MATLAB JIT were not clever enough to tell whether you were using them as variables or as imaginary units, and would therefore turn off many otherwise possible optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your code would therefore get slower just by the very presence of &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; as variables, and would speed up if you changed them to something else. That&apos;s why, if you read through much MathWorks code, you&apos;ll see &lt;code&gt;ii&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;jj&lt;/code&gt; used fairly widely as loop indices. For a while, MathWorks might even have unofficially advised people to do that themselves (although they always officially advise people to program for elegance/maintainability rather than to whatever the current JIT does, as it&apos;s a moving target each version).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But that&apos;s rather a long time ago, and nowadays it&apos;s a bit of a &quot;zombie&quot; issue that is really much less important than many people still think, but refuses to die.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In any recent version, it&apos;s really a personal preference whether to use &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; as variable names or not. If you do a lot of work with complex numbers, you may want to avoid &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; as variables, to avoid any small potential risk of confusion (although you may also/instead want to only use &lt;code&gt;1i&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;1j&lt;/code&gt; for even less confusion, and a little better performance).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, in my typical work I never deal with complex numbers, and I find my code more readable if I feel free to use &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; as loop indices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of answers here that say &lt;em&gt;It is not recommended...&lt;/em&gt; without saying who&apos;s doing that recommending. Here&apos;s the extent of MathWorks&apos; actual recommendations, from the current release documentation for &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Since i is a function, it can be overridden and used as a variable. However, it is best to avoid using i and j for variable names if you intend to use them in complex arithmetic. [...] For speed and improved robustness, you can replace complex i and j by 1i.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;As described in other answers, the use of &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; in general code is not recommended for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you want to use the imaginary number, it can be confused with or overwritten by an index&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you use it as an index it can overwrite or be confused with the imaginary number&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As suggested: &lt;code&gt;1i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ii&lt;/code&gt; are recommended. However, though these are both fine deviations from &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, it is not very nice to use both of these alternatives together.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here is an example why (personally) I don&apos;t like it:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-matlab s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-matlab&quot;&gt;val2 = val + &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;% 1&lt;/span&gt;\nval2 = val + ii &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;% 2&lt;/span&gt;\nval2 = val + &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;% 3&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One will not easily be misread for two or three, but two and three resemble each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Therefore my personal recommendation would be: In case you sometimes work with complex code, always use &lt;code&gt;1i&lt;/code&gt; combined with a different loop variable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Examples of single letter indices that for if you don&apos;t use many loop variables and letters suffice: &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Example of longer indices: &lt;code&gt;i_loop&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;step&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;walk&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;t_now&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course this is a matter of personal taste as well, but it should not be hard to find indices to use that have a clear meaning without growing too long.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;It was pointed out that &lt;code&gt;1i&lt;/code&gt; is an acceptable and unambiguous way to write &lt;code&gt;sqrt(-1)&lt;/code&gt;, and that as such there is no need to avoid using &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;. Then again, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14790740/using-i-and-j-as-variables-in-matlab/14893729#14893729&quot;&gt;Dennis pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, it can be hard to see the difference between &lt;code&gt;1i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ii&lt;/code&gt;. My suggestion: use &lt;code&gt;1j&lt;/code&gt; as the imaginary constant where possible. It&apos;s the same trick that electrical engineers employ - they use &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;sqrt(-1)&lt;/code&gt; because &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is already taken for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;current&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Personally I never use &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;; I use &lt;code&gt;ii&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;jj&lt;/code&gt; as shorthand indexing variables, (and kk, ll, mm, ...) and &lt;code&gt;1j&lt;/code&gt; when I need to use complex numbers.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Confusion with the imaginary unit has been well covered here, but there are some other more prosaic reasons why these and other single-letter variable names are sometimes discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;MATLAB specifically: if you&apos;re using coder to generate C++ source from your MATLAB code (don&apos;t, it&apos;s horrible) then you are explicitly warned not to reuse variables because of potential typing clashes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, and depending on your IDE, a single-letter variable name can cause havoc with highlighters and search/replace. MATLAB doesn&apos;t suffer from this and I believe Visual Studio hasn&apos;t had a problem for some time, but the C/C++ coding standards like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MISRA_C&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;MISRA&lt;/a&gt;, etc. tend to advise against them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For my part I avoid all single-letter variables, despite the obvious advantages for directly implementing mathematical sources. It takes a little extra effort the first few hundred times you do it, but after that you stop noticing, and the advantages when you or some other poor soul come to read your code are legion.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;By default &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; stand for the imaginary unit. So from MATLAB&apos;s point of view, using &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; as a variable is somehow like using &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; as a variable.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Any non-trivial code contains multiple &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops, and the best practices recommend you use a descriptive name indicative of its purpose and scope. For times immemorial (and unless its 5-10 lines script that I am not going to save),  I have always been using variable names like &lt;code&gt;idxTask&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;idxAnotherTask&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;idxSubTask&lt;/code&gt; etc. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or at the very least doubling the first letter of the array it is indexing e.g. &lt;code&gt;ss&lt;/code&gt; to index &lt;code&gt;subjectList&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tt&lt;/code&gt; to index &lt;code&gt;taskList&lt;/code&gt;, but not &lt;code&gt;ii&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;jj&lt;/code&gt; which doesn&apos;t help me effortlessly identify which array they are indexing out of my multiple for loops.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Unless you are a very confused user I think there is very little risk in using variable names &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;j&lt;/em&gt; and I use them regularly. I haven&apos;t seen any official indication that this practice should be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While it&apos;s true that shadowing the imaginary unit could cause some confusion in some context as mentioned in other posts, overall I simply don&apos;t see it as a major issue. There are far more confusing things you can do in MATLAB, take for instance defining &lt;code&gt;false=true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In my opinion the only time you should probably avoid them is if your code specifically deals with imaginary numbers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    "],"592":["\n&lt;p&gt;Structs are value types which means they are copied when they are passed around. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So if you change a copy you are changing only that copy, not the original and not any other copies which might be around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your struct is immutable then all automatic copies resulting from being passed by value will be the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to change it you have to consciously do it by creating a new instance of the struct with the modified data. (not a copy)&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Where to start ;-p&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/ericlippert/mutating-readonly-structs&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Eric Lippert&apos;s blog&lt;/a&gt; is always good for a quote:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;This is yet another reason why mutable\n  value types are evil. Try to always\n  make value types immutable.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, you tend to lose changes quite easily... for example, getting things out of a list:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-cs s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-csharp&quot;&gt;Foo foo = list[&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;];\nfoo.Name = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;abc&quot;&lt;/span&gt;;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;what did that change? Nothing useful...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same with properties:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-cs s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-csharp&quot;&gt;myObj.SomeProperty.Size = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// the compiler spots this one&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;forcing you to do:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-cs s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-csharp&quot;&gt;Bar bar = myObj.SomeProperty;\nbar.Size = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;;\nmyObj.SomeProperty = bar;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;less critically, there is a size issue; mutable objects &lt;strong&gt;tend&lt;/strong&gt; to have multiple properties; yet if you have a struct with two &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;s, a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;DateTime&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt;, you can very quickly burn through a lot of memory. With a class, multiple callers can share a reference to the same instance (references are small).&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&apos;t say &lt;em&gt;evil&lt;/em&gt; but mutability is often a sign of overeagerness on the part of the programmer to provide a maximum of functionality. In reality, this is often not needed and that, in turn, makes the interface smaller, easier to use and harder to use wrong (= more robust).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One example of this is read/write and write/write conflicts in race conditions. These simply can&apos;t occur in immutable structures, since a write is not a valid operation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/406760/whats-your-most-controversial-programming-opinion/407007#407007&quot;&gt;Also, I claim that &lt;strong&gt;mutability is almost never actually needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the programmer just &lt;em&gt;thinks&lt;/em&gt; that it &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be in the future. For example, it simply doesn&apos;t make sense to change a date. Rather, create a new date based off the old one. This is a cheap operation, so performance is not a consideration.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Mutable structs are not evil. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are absolutely necessary in high performance circumstances. For example when cache lines and or garbage collection become a bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would not call the use of a immutable struct in these perfectly valid use-cases &quot;evil&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can see the point that C#&apos;s syntax does not help to distinguish the access of a member of a value type or of a reference type, so I am all for &lt;em&gt;preferring&lt;/em&gt; immutable structs, that enforce immutability, over mutable structs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, instead of simply labelling immutable structs as &quot;evil&quot;, I would advise to embrace the language and advocate more helpful and constructive rule of thumbs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example: &lt;em&gt;&quot;structs are value types, which are copied by default. you need a reference if you don&apos;t want to copy them&quot;&lt;/em&gt; or\n&lt;em&gt;&quot;try to work with readonly structs first&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Structs with public mutable fields or properties are not evil.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Struct methods (as distinct from property setters) which mutate &quot;this&quot; are somewhat evil, only because .net doesn&apos;t provide a means of distinguishing them from methods which do not.  Struct methods that do not mutate &quot;this&quot; should be invokable even on read-only structs without any need for defensive copying.  Methods which do mutate &quot;this&quot; should not be invokable at all on read-only structs.  Since .net doesn&apos;t want to forbid struct methods that don&apos;t modify &quot;this&quot; from being invoked on read-only structs, but doesn&apos;t want to allow read-only structs to be mutated, it defensively copies structs in read-only contexts, arguably getting the worst of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the problems with the handling of self-mutating methods in read-only contexts, however, mutable structs often offer semantics far superior to mutable class types.  Consider the following three method signatures:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;struct PointyStruct {public int x,y,z;};\nclass PointyClass {public int x,y,z;};\n\nvoid Method1(PointyStruct foo);\nvoid Method2(ref PointyStruct foo);\nvoid Method3(PointyClass foo);\n&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For each method, answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assuming the method doesn&apos;t use any &quot;unsafe&quot; code, might it modify foo?\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If no outside references to &apos;foo&apos; exist before the method is called, could an outside reference exist after?\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Answers:&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;spoiler&quot; data-spoiler=&quot;Reveal spoiler&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt; Question 1:&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;code&gt;Method1()&lt;/code&gt;: no &lt;em&gt;(clear intent)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;code&gt;Method2()&lt;/code&gt;: yes &lt;em&gt;(clear intent)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;code&gt;Method3()&lt;/code&gt;: yes &lt;em&gt;(uncertain intent)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n Question 2:&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;code&gt;Method1()&lt;/code&gt;: no&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;code&gt;Method2()&lt;/code&gt;: no &lt;em&gt;(unless unsafe)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;code&gt;Method3()&lt;/code&gt;: yes&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Method1 can&apos;t modify foo, and never gets a reference.  Method2 gets a short-lived reference to foo, which it can use modify the fields of foo any number of times, in any order, until it returns, but it can&apos;t persist that reference.  Before Method2 returns, unless it uses unsafe code, any and all copies that might have been made of its &apos;foo&apos; reference will have disappeared.  Method3, unlike Method2, gets a promiscuously-sharable reference to foo, and there&apos;s no telling what it might do with it.  It might not change foo at all, it might change foo and then return, or it might give a reference to foo to another thread which might mutate it in some arbitrary way at some arbitrary future time.  The only way to limit what Method3 might do to a mutable class object passed into it would be to encapsulate the mutable object into a read-only wrapper, which is ugly and cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arrays of structures offer wonderful semantics.  Given RectArray[500] of type Rectangle, it&apos;s clear and obvious how to e.g. copy element 123 to element 456 and then some time later set the width of element 123 to 555, without disturbing element 456.  &quot;RectArray[432] = RectArray[321]; ...; RectArray[123].Width = 555;&quot;.  Knowing that Rectangle is a struct with an integer field called Width will tell one all one needs to know about the above statements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now suppose RectClass was a class with the same fields as Rectangle and one wanted to do the same operations on a RectClassArray[500] of type RectClass.  Perhaps the array is supposed to hold 500 pre-initialized immutable references to mutable RectClass objects.  in that case, the proper code would be something like &quot;RectClassArray[321].SetBounds(RectClassArray[456]); ...; RectClassArray[321].X = 555;&quot;.  Perhaps the array is assumed to hold instances that aren&apos;t going to change, so the proper code would be more like &quot;RectClassArray[321] = RectClassArray[456]; ...; RectClassArray[321] = New RectClass(RectClassArray[321]); RectClassArray[321].X = 555;&quot;  To know what one is supposed to do, one would have to know a lot more both about RectClass (e.g. does it support a copy constructor, a copy-from method, etc.) and the intended usage of the array.  Nowhere near as clean as using a struct.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be sure, there is unfortunately no nice way for any container class other than an array to offer the clean semantics of a struct array.  The best one could do, if one wanted a collection to be indexed with e.g. a string, would probably be to offer a generic &quot;ActOnItem&quot; method which would accept a string for the index, a generic parameter, and a delegate which would be passed by reference both the generic parameter and the collection item.  That would allow nearly the same semantics as struct arrays, but unless the vb.net and C# people can be pursuaded to offer a nice syntax, the code is going to be clunky-looking even if it is reasonably performance (passing a generic parameter would allow for use of a static delegate and would avoid any need to create any temporary class instances).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&apos;m peeved at the hatred Eric Lippert et al. spew regarding mutable value types.  They offer much cleaner semantics than the promiscuous reference types that are used all over the place.  Despite some of the limitations with .net&apos;s support for value types, there are many cases where mutable value types are a better fit than any other kind of entity.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;There are a couple other corner cases that could lead to unpredictable behavior from the programmer&apos;s point of view.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Immutable value types and readonly fields&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-cs s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-csharp&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Simple mutable structure. &lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Method IncrementI mutates current state.&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; Mutable\n    {\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;Mutable&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; i&lt;/span&gt;) : &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; \n        {\n            I = i;\n        }\n\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;IncrementI&lt;/span&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; { I++; }\n\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; I { &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;; }\n    }\n\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Simple class that contains Mutable structure&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// as readonly field&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;SomeClass&lt;/span&gt; \n    {\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; Mutable mutable = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Mutable(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;);\n    }\n\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Simple class that contains Mutable structure&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// as ordinary (non-readonly) field&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;AnotherClass&lt;/span&gt; \n    {\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; Mutable mutable = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Mutable(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;);\n    }\n\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;Program&lt;/span&gt;\n    {\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;Main&lt;/span&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;\n        {\n            &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Case 1.

What behavior are you expecting from this call? Should it change the array&apos;s value or only a copy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-cs s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-csharp&quot;&gt;    Mutable[] arrayOfMutables = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Mutable[&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;];\n    arrayOfMutables[&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;] = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Mutable(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;);\n\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Now we actually accessing reference to the first element&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// without making any additional copy&lt;/span&gt;\n    arrayOfMutables[&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;].IncrementI();\n\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Prints 6!!&lt;/span&gt;\n    Console.WriteLine(arrayOfMutables[&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;].I);\n\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Every array implements IList&amp;lt;T&amp;gt; interface&lt;/span&gt;\n    IList&amp;lt;Mutable&amp;gt; listOfMutables = arrayOfMutables;\n\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// But accessing values through this interface lead&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// to different behavior: IList indexer returns a copy&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// instead of an managed reference&lt;/span&gt;\n    listOfMutables[&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;].IncrementI(); &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Should change I to 7&lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Nope! we still have 6, because previous line of code&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// mutate a copy instead of a list value&lt;/span&gt;\n    Console.WriteLine(listOfMutables[&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;].I);\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, mutable structs are not evil as long as you and the rest of the team clearly understand what you are doing. But there are too many corner cases when the program behavior would be different from what&apos;s expected, that could lead to subtle hard to produce and hard to understand errors.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Value types basically represents immutable concepts. Fx, it makes no sense to have a mathematical value such as an integer, vector etc. and then be able to modify it. That would be like redefining the meaning of a value. Instead of changing a value type, it makes more sense to assign another unique value. Think about the fact that value types are compared by comparing all the values of its properties. The point is that if the properties are the same then it is the same universal representation of that value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Konrad mentions it doesn&apos;t make sense to change a date either, as the value represents that unique point in time and not an instance of a time object which has any state or context-dependency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hopes this makes any sense to you. It is more about the concept you try to capture with value types than practical details, to be sure. &lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;If you have ever programmed in a language like C/C++, structs are fine to use as mutable. Just pass them with ref, around and there is nothing that can go wrong. The only problem I find are the restrictions of the C# compiler and that, in some cases, I am unable to force the stupid thing to use a reference to the struct, instead of a Copy(like when a struct is part of a C# class).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, mutable structs are not evil, C# has &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; them evil. I use mutable structs in C++ all the time and they are very convenient and intuitive. In contrast, C# has made me to completely abandon structs as members of classes because of the way they handle objects. Their convenience has cost us ours.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;If you stick to what structs are intended for (in C#, Visual Basic 6, Pascal/Delphi, C++ struct type (or classes) when they are not used as pointers), you will find that a structure is not more than a &lt;em&gt;compound variable&lt;/em&gt;. This means: you will treat them as a packed set of variables, under a common name (a record variable you reference members from).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know that would confuse a lot of people deeply used to OOP, but that&apos;s not enough reason to say such things are inherently evil, if used correctly. Some structures are inmutable as they intend (this is the case of Python&apos;s &lt;code&gt;namedtuple&lt;/code&gt;), but it is another paradigm to consider.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes: structs involve a lot of memory, but it will not be precisely more memory by doing:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-cs s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-csharp&quot;&gt;point.x = point.x + &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;compared to:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-cs s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-csharp&quot;&gt;point = Point(point.x + &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, point.y)\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The memory consumption will be at least the same, or even more in the inmutable case (although that case would be temporary, for the current stack, depending on the language).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But, finally, structures are &lt;em&gt;structures&lt;/em&gt;, not objects. In POO, the main property of an object is their &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt;, which most of the times is not more than its memory address. Struct stands for data structure (not a proper object, and so they don&apos;t have identity anyhow), and data can be modified. In other languages, &lt;em&gt;record&lt;/em&gt; (instead of &lt;em&gt;struct&lt;/em&gt;, as is the case for Pascal) is the word and holds the same purpose: just a data record variable, intended to be read from files, modified, and dumped into files (that is the main use and, in many languages, you can even define data alignment in the record, while that&apos;s not necessarily the case for properly called Objects).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Want a good example? Structs are used to read files easily. Python has &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/2/library/struct.html&quot;&gt;this library&lt;/a&gt; because, since it is object-oriented and has no support for structs, it had to implement it in another way, which is somewhat ugly. Languages implementing structs have that feature... built-in. Try reading a bitmap header with an appropriate struct in languages like Pascal or C. It will be easy (if the struct is properly built and aligned; in Pascal you would not use a record-based access but functions to read arbitrary binary data). So, for files and direct (local) memory access, structs are better than objects. As for today, we&apos;re used to JSON and XML, and so we forget the use of binary files (and as a side effect, the use of structs). But yes: they exist, and have a purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are not evil. Just use them for the right purpose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you think in terms of hammers, you will want to treat screws as nails, to find screws are harder to plunge in the wall, and it will be screws&apos; fault, and they will be the evil ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have an array of 1,000,000 structs. Each struct representing an equity with stuff like bid_price, offer_price (perhaps decimals) and so on, this is created by C#/VB.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine that array is created in a block of memory allocated in the unmanaged heap so that some other native code thread is able to concurrently access the array (perhaps some high-perf code doing math).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine the C#/VB code is listening to a market feed of price changes, that code may have to access some element of the array (for whichever security) and then modify some price field(s).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine this is being done tens or even hundreds of thousands of times per second.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well lets face facts, in this case we really do want these structs to be mutable, they need to be because they are being shared by some other native code so creating copies isn&apos;t gonna help; they need to be because making a copy of some 120 byte struct at these rates is lunacy, especially when an update may actually impact just a byte or two.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hugo&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;When something can be mutated, it gains a sense of identity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-cs s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; Person {\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; name; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// mutable&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; Point position = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Point(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;); &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// mutable&lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; name, Point position&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; { ... }\n}\n\nPerson eric = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Person(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;Eric Lippert&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Point(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;));\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; is mutable, it&apos;s more natural to think about &lt;em&gt;changing Eric&apos;s position&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;em&gt;cloning Eric, moving the clone, and destroying the original&lt;/em&gt;. Both operations would succeed in changing the contents of &lt;code&gt;eric.position&lt;/code&gt;, but one is more intuitive than the other. Likewise, it&apos;s more intuitive to pass Eric around (as a reference) for methods to modify him. Giving a method a clone of Eric is almost always going to be surprising. Anyone wanting to mutate &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; must remember to ask for a reference to &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; or they&apos;ll be doing the wrong thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you make the type immutable, the problem goes away; if I can&apos;t modify &lt;code&gt;eric&lt;/code&gt;, it makes no difference to me whether I receive &lt;code&gt;eric&lt;/code&gt; or a clone of &lt;code&gt;eric&lt;/code&gt;. More generally, a type is safe to pass by value if all of its observable state is held in members that are either:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;immutable&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;reference types&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;safe to pass by value&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If those conditions are met then a mutable value type behaves like a reference type because a shallow copy will still allow the receiver to modify the original data.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The intuitiveness of an immutable &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; depends on what you&apos;re trying to do though. If &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; just represents a &lt;em&gt;set of data&lt;/em&gt; about a person, there&apos;s nothing unintuitive about it; &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; variables truly represent abstract &lt;em&gt;values&lt;/em&gt;, not objects. (In that case, it&apos;d probably be more appropriate to rename it to &lt;code&gt;PersonData&lt;/code&gt;.) If &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; is actually modeling a person itself, the idea of constantly creating and moving clones is silly even if you&apos;ve avoided the pitfall of thinking you&apos;re modifying the original. In that case it&apos;d probably be more natural to simply make &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; a reference type (that is, a class.) &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Granted, as functional programming has taught us there are benefits to making &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; immutable (no one can secretly hold on to a reference to &lt;code&gt;eric&lt;/code&gt; and mutate him), but since that&apos;s not idiomatic in OOP it&apos;s still going to be unintuitive to anyone else working with your code.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;It doesnt have anything to do with structs (and not with C#, either) but in Java you might get problems with mutable objects when they are e.g. keys in a hash map. If you change them after adding them to a map and it changes its &lt;a href=&quot;http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html#hashCode()&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;hash code&lt;/a&gt;, evil things might happen.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;There are many advantages and disadvantages to mutable data.  The million-dollar disadvantage is aliasing.  If the same value is being used in multiple places, and one of them changes it, then it will appear to have magically changed to the other places that are using it.  This is related to, but not identical with, race conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The million-dollar advantage is modularity, sometimes.  Mutable state can allow you to hide changing information from code that doesn&apos;t need to know about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/6094&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;The Art of the Interpreter&lt;/a&gt; goes into these trade offs in some detail, and gives some examples.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Personally when I look at code the following looks pretty clunky to me:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;data.value.set ( data.value.get () + 1 ) ;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;rather than simply&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;data.value++ ; or data.value = data.value + 1 ;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Data encapsulation is useful when passing a class around and you want to ensure the value is modified in a controlled fashion.  However when you have public set and get functions that do little more than set the value to what ever is passed in, how is this an improvement over simply passing a public data structure around?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I create a private structure inside a class, I created that structure to organize a set of variables into one group.  I want to be able to modify that structure within the class scope, not get copies of that structure and create new instances.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To me this prevents a valid use of structures being used to organize public variables, if I wanted access control I&apos;d use a class.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;There are several issues with Mr. Eric Lippert&apos;s example. It is contrived to illustrate the point that structs are copied and how that could be a problem if you are not careful. Looking at the example I see it as a result of a bad programming habit and not really a problem with either struct or the class. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A struct is supposed to have only public members and should not require any encapsulation. If it does then it really should be a type/class. You really do not need two constructs to say the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have class enclosing a struct, you would call a method in the class to mutate the member struct. This is what I would do as a good programming habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A proper implementation would be as follows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-cs s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-csharp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; Mutable {\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; x;\n}\n\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;Test&lt;/span&gt; {\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; Mutable m = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Mutable();\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;mutate&lt;/span&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;\n    { \n        m.x = m.x + &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;;\n        &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; m.x;\n    }\n  }\n  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-function&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title&quot;&gt;Main&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;[] args&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; {\n        Test t = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Test();\n        System.Console.WriteLine(t.mutate());\n        System.Console.WriteLine(t.mutate());\n        System.Console.WriteLine(t.mutate());\n    }\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looks like it is an issue with programming habit as opposed to an issue with struct itself. Structs are supposed to be mutable, that is the idea and intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result of the changes voila behaves as expected:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1\n2\n3\nPress any key to continue . . .&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t believe they&apos;re evil if used correctly. I wouldn&apos;t put it in my production code, but I would for something like structured unit testing mocks, where the lifespan of a struct is relatively small.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using the Eric example, perhaps you want to create a second instance of that Eric, but make adjustments, as that&apos;s the nature of your test (ie duplication, then modifying). It doesn&apos;t matter what happens with the first instance of Eric if we&apos;re just using Eric2 for the remainder of the test script, unless you&apos;re planning on using him as a test comparison.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This would be mostly useful for testing or modifying legacy code that shallow defines a particular object (the point of structs), but by having an immutable struct, this prevents it&apos;s usage annoyingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n    "],"593":["\n&lt;p&gt;Flexbox is a &quot;1-dimensional&quot; layout system: It can align items along horizontal OR vertical lines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A true grid system is &quot;2-dimensional&quot;: It can align items along horizontal AND vertical lines. In other words, cells can span across columns and rows, which flexbox cannot do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is why flexbox has a limited capacity for building grids. It&apos;s also a reason why the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;W3C&lt;/a&gt; has developed another CSS3 technology, &lt;strong&gt;Grid Layout&lt;/strong&gt; (see below).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a flex container with &lt;code&gt;flex-flow: row wrap&lt;/code&gt;, flex items must wrap to new &lt;em&gt;rows&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This means that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;a flex item cannot wrap under another item in the same row&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/t44yd.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/t44yd.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Notice above how &lt;em&gt;div #3&lt;/em&gt; wraps below &lt;em&gt;div #1&lt;/em&gt;, creating a new row. It cannot wrap beneath &lt;em&gt;div #2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, when items aren&apos;t the tallest in the row, white space remains, creating unsightly gaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/h3lnP.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/h3lnP.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/t44yd.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/oQBuw.gif&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;image credit: &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/users/2299439/jefree-sujit&quot;&gt;Jefree Sujit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;code&gt;column wrap&lt;/code&gt; Solution&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you switch to &lt;code&gt;flex-flow: column wrap&lt;/code&gt;, flex items will stack vertically and a grid-like layout is more attainable. However, a column-direction container has three potential problems right off the bat:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It expands the container horizontally, not vertically (like the Pinterest layout).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/q/42946454/3597276&quot;&gt;It requires the container to have a fixed height, so the items know where to wrap.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As of this writing, it has a deficiency in all major browsers where &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/q/33891709/3597276&quot;&gt;the container doesn&apos;t expand to accommodate additional columns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, a column-direction container may not be feasible in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Other Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add containers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the first two images above, consider wrapping items 2 and 3 in a separate container. This new container can be a sibling to item 1. Done.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s a detailed example: &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/q/39079773/3597276&quot;&gt;Calculator keypad layout with flexbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One downside worth highlighting: If you&apos;re wanting to use the &lt;code&gt;order&lt;/code&gt; property to re-arrange your layout (such as in media queries), this method may eliminate that option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://masonry.desandro.com/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desandro Masonry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Masonry is a JavaScript grid layout library.

Some problems:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The are not invertible: given a point on the plot space, you can not uniquely map it back to a point in the data space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are relatively hard to read correctly compared to other options. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lri.fr/~isenberg/publications/papers/Isenberg_2011_ASO.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;A Study on Dual-Scale Data Charts&lt;/a&gt; by Petra Isenberg, Anastasia Bezerianos, Pierre Dragicevic, and Jean-Daniel Fekete for details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are easily manipulated to mislead: there is no unique way to specify the relative scales of the axes, leaving them open to manipulation.  Two examples from the Junkcharts blog: &lt;a href=&quot;http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/2006/06/illusion_of_suc.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/2006/05/the_crossover_l.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are arbitrary: why have only 2 scales, not 3, 4 or ten?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You also might want to read Stephen Few&apos;s lengthy discussion on the topic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/dual-scaled_axes.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Dual-Scaled Axes in Graphs Are They Ever the Best Solution?&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a client wants two y scales. Giving them the &quot;flawed&quot; speech is often pointless. But I do like the ggplot2 insistence on doing things the right way. I am sure that ggplot is in fact educating the average user about proper visualization techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you can use faceting and scale free to compare the two data series? - e.g. look here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2/wiki/Align-two-plots-on-a-page&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2/wiki/Align-two-plots-on-a-page&lt;/a&gt;      &lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;There are common use-cases dual y axes, e.g., the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climograph&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;climatograph&lt;/a&gt; showing monthly temperature and precipitation.

when specifying the y_scale is to &lt;strong&gt;multiply&lt;/strong&gt; each value the 2nd data series with 5 when specifying the series. In order to get the labels right in the sec_axis definition, it then needs &lt;strong&gt;dividing&lt;/strong&gt; by 5 (and formatting). So a crucial part in above code is really &lt;code&gt;*5&lt;/code&gt; in the geom_line and &lt;code&gt;~./5&lt;/code&gt; in sec_axis (a formula dividing the current value &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; by 5). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In comparison (I don&apos;t want to judge the approaches here), this is how two charts on top of one another look like: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/gCjvf.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/gCjvf.png&quot; alt=&quot;two charts above one another&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can judge for yourself which one better transports the message (Dont disrupt people at work!).

So one wants to plot the data together on one plot with the scale of &lt;em&gt;y1&lt;/em&gt; on the left and &lt;em&gt;y2&lt;/em&gt; on the right. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-r s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-r&quot;&gt;

but report the second against a secondary axis with labels showing the original scale &lt;em&gt;y2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So we build a first helper function &lt;em&gt;CalcFudgeAxis&lt;/em&gt; which calculates and collects features of the new axis to be shown. The function can be amended to ayones liking (this one just maps &lt;em&gt;y2&lt;/em&gt; onto the range of &lt;em&gt;y1&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-r s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-r&quot;&gt;CalcFudgeAxis &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;

alt=&quot;2 axes&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Above solution is, to put it straight, a limited shaky hack. As it plays with the ggplot kernel it will throw some warnings that we exchange post-the-fact scales, etc. It has to be handled with care and may produce some undesired behaviour in another setting. As well one may need to fiddle around with the helper functions to get the layout as desired. The placement of the legend is such an issue (it would be placed between the panel and the new axis; this is why I droped it). The scaling / alignment of the 2 axis is as well a bit challenging: The code above works nicely when both scales contain the &quot;0&quot;, else one axis gets shifted. So definetly with some opportunities to improve...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In case on wants to save the pic one has to wrap the call into device open / close:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-r s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-r&quot;&gt;png&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;...&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\nPlotWithFudgeAxis&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;tmpPlot&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; FudgeAxis&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\ndev.off&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Here are my two cents on how to do the transformations for secondary axis. First, you want to couple the the ranges of the primary and secondary data. This is usually messy in terms of polluting your global environment with variables you don&apos;t want.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To make this easier, we&apos;ll make a function factory that produces two functions, wherein &lt;code&gt;scales::rescale()&lt;/code&gt; does all the heavy lifting. Because these are closures, they are aware of the environment in which they were created, so they &apos;have a memory&apos; of the &lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;from&lt;/code&gt; parameters generated before creation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;One functions does the forward transformation: transforms the secondary data to the primary scale.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The second function does the reverse transformation: transforms data in primary units to secondary units.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-r s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-r&quot;&gt;library&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;ggplot2&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\nlibrary&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;scales&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;# Function factory for secondary axis transforms&lt;/span&gt;\ntrain_sec &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;primary&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; secondary&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; na.rm &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;TRUE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;# Thanks Henry Holm for including the na.rm argument!&lt;/span&gt;\n  from &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;secondary&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; na.rm &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; na.rm&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n  to   &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;primary&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; na.rm &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; na.rm&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;# Forward transform for the data&lt;/span&gt;\n  forward &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;x&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;\n    rescale&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;x&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; from&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; to&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;# Reverse transform for the secondary axis&lt;/span&gt;\n  reverse &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;x&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;\n    rescale&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;x&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; to&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; from&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-built_in&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;fwd &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; forward&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; rev &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; reverse&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This seems all rather complicated, but making the function factory makes all the rest easier. Now, before we make a plot, we&apos;ll produce the relevant functions by showing the factory the primary and secondary data. We&apos;ll use the economics dataset which has very different ranges for the &lt;code&gt;unemploy&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;psavert&lt;/code&gt; columns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-r s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-r&quot;&gt;sec &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; with&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;economics&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; train_sec&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;unemploy&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; psavert&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Then we use &lt;code&gt;y = sec$fwd(psavert)&lt;/code&gt; to rescale the secondary data to primary axis, and specify &lt;code&gt;~ sec$rev(.)&lt;/code&gt; as the transformation argument to the secondary axis. This gives us a plot where the primary and secondary ranges occupy the same space on the plot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-r s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-r&quot;&gt;ggplot&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;economics&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-punctuation&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

Remember that all of the data will take as base the first y axis. So that data needs to be normalized for the first y axis.

works better with just two data points from the data set of each axesusually the maximum and minimum values of each set. The resulting slopes and intercepts of the two regressions enable ggplot2 to exactly pair the plots of the minimums and maximums of each axis. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3099219/ggplot-with-2-y-axes-on-each-side-and-different-scales&quot;&gt;user4786271&lt;/a&gt; pointed out, the two regressions transform each data set and plot to the other. One transforms the break points of the first y axis to the values of the second y axis. The second transforms the data of the secondary y axis to be &quot;normalized&quot; according to the first y axis.\nThe following output shows how the axis align the minimums and maximums of each dataset:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/xTwzN.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/xTwzN.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Having the maximums and minimums match may be most appropriate; however, another benefit of this method is that the plot associated with the secondary axis can be easily shifted, if desired, by altering a programming line related to the primary axis data. The output below simply changes the minimum precipitation input in the programming line of y1 to &quot;0&quot;, and thus aligns the minimum Temperature level with the &quot;0&quot; Precipitation level.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From: y1&amp;lt;-(c(max(climate$Precip), min(climate$Precip)))&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To: y1&amp;lt;-(c(max(climate$Precip), 0))&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/SfWS7.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/SfWS7.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Notice how the resulting new regressions and ggplot2 automatically adjusted the plot and axis to correctly align the minimum Temperature to the new &quot;base&quot; of the &quot;0&quot; Precipitation level. Likewise, one is easily able to elevate the Temperature plot so that it is more obvious. The following graph is created by simply changing the above-noted line to:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;y1&amp;lt;-(c(150, 55))&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The above line tells the maximum of the Temperature graph to coincide with the &quot;150&quot; Precipitation level, and the minimum of the temperature line to coincide with the &quot;55&quot; Precipitation level. Again, notice how ggplot2 and the resulting new regression outputs enable the graph to maintain correct alignment with the axis.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/OLWX5.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/OLWX5.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The above may not be a desirable output; however, it is an example of how the graph can be easily manipulated and still have correct relationships between the plots and the axis.\nThe incorporation of &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3099219/ggplot-with-2-y-axes-on-each-side-and-different-scales&quot;&gt;Dag Hjermann&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s theme improves identification of the axis corresponding to the plot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/HjyWG.png&quot;

This is done by dividing the value at each point in\n  time by the value for the initial point in time and then multiplying\n  it by 100 to convert the rate to a percentage, as illustrated below.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-r s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-r&quot;&gt;df2&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;df\ndf2&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;Persons.Involved &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-operator&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;

 \n});\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;After finding the way to get my code work, I think I should make thing a bit clear:\nFor using:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;$(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;html, body&apos;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;animate&lt;/span&gt;({\n   &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;scrollTop&lt;/span&gt;: $(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;#div1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;offset&lt;/span&gt;().&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;\n}, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;2000&lt;/span&gt;);\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;you need to be on top of the page since &lt;code&gt;$(&quot;#div1&quot;).offset().top&lt;/code&gt; will return different numbers for different positions you scroll to. If you already scrolled out of the top, you need to specify the exact &lt;code&gt;pageY&lt;/code&gt; value (see &lt;code&gt;pageY&lt;/code&gt; definition here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascript.info/coordinates&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://javascript.info/coordinates&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So now, the problem is to calculate the &lt;code&gt;pageY&lt;/code&gt; value of one element. Below is an example in case the scroll container is the body:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;getPageY&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;) {\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; elem = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable language_&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;getElementById&lt;/span&gt;(id);\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; box = elem.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;getBoundingClientRect&lt;/span&gt;();\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; body = &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable language_&quot;&gt;document&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;getElementsByTagName&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;BODY&quot;&lt;/span&gt;)[&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;];\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; box.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt; + body.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;scrollTop&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// for window scroll: box.top + window.scrollY;&lt;/span&gt;\n}\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The above function returns the same number even if you scrolled somewhere. Now, to scroll back to that element:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;$(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;html, body&quot;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;animate&lt;/span&gt;({ &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;scrollTop&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;getPageY&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;div1&apos;&lt;/span&gt;) }, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;slow&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;In most cases, it would be best to use a plugin. Seriously. I&apos;m going to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hashchange/jquery.scrollable&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;jQuery.scrollable&quot;&gt;tout mine here&lt;/a&gt;. Of course there are others, too. But please check if they really avoid the pitfalls for which you&apos;d want a plugin in the first place - not all of them do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have written about the reasons for using a plugin &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hashchange/jquery.scrollable#why&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;jQuery.scrollable: Why even use it?&quot;&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. In a nutshell, the one liner underpinning most answers here &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;$(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;html, body&apos;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;animate&lt;/span&gt;( { &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;scrollTop&lt;/span&gt;: $target.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;offset&lt;/span&gt;().&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt; }, duration );\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;is bad UX.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The animation doesn&apos;t respond to user actions. It carries on even if the user clicks, taps, or tries to scroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the starting point of the animation is close to the target element, the animation is painfully slow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the target element is placed near the bottom of the page, it can&apos;t be scrolled to the top of the window. The scroll animation stops abruptly then, in mid motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To handle these issues (and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hashchange/jquery.scrollable#why&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;jQuery.scrollable: Why even use it?&quot;&gt;bunch of others&lt;/a&gt;), you can use a plugin of mine, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hashchange/jquery.scrollable&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;jQuery.scrollable&quot;&gt;jQuery.scrollable&lt;/a&gt;. The call then becomes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;$( &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable language_&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt; ).&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;scrollTo&lt;/span&gt;( targetPosition );\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and that&apos;s it. Of course, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hashchange/jquery.scrollable#animation-options&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;jQuery.scrollable: Animation options&quot;&gt;more options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With regard to the target position, &lt;code&gt;$target.offset().top&lt;/code&gt; does the job in most cases. But please be aware that the returned value doesn&apos;t take a border on the &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; element into account (&lt;a href=&quot;http://jsbin.com/vifugo/3&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;$elem.offset() does not account for html border - JS Bin&quot;&gt;see this demo&lt;/a&gt;). If you need the target position to be accurate under any circumstances, it is better to use&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;targetPosition = $( &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-variable language_&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt; ).&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;scrollTop&lt;/span&gt;() + $target[&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;].&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;getBoundingClientRect&lt;/span&gt;().&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That works even if a border on the &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; element is set.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;This is my approach abstracting the ID&apos;s and href&apos;s, using a generic class selector&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;snippet&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot; data-hide=&quot;false&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;snippet-code&quot;&gt;\n&lt;pre class=&quot;snippet-code-js lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;$(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) {\n  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Generic selector to be used anywhere&lt;/span&gt;\n  $(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;.js-scroll-to&quot;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-params&quot;&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;) {\n\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;// Get the href dynamically&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt;

In our case we don&apos;t scroll the full body, but just particular elements with overflow: auto; within a larger layout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It creates a fake input of the height of the target element, and then puts a focus to it, and the browser will take care about the rest no matter how deep within the scrollable hierarchy you are. Works like a charm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; $scrollTo = $(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;#someId&apos;&lt;/span&gt;),\ninputElem = $(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;&amp;lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/input&amp;gt;&apos;&lt;/span&gt;);\n\n$scrollTo.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;prepend&lt;/span&gt;(inputElem);\ninputElem.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;css&lt;/span&gt;({\n  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;absolute&apos;&lt;/span&gt;,\n  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;1px&apos;&lt;/span&gt;,\n  &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;: $scrollTo.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;()\n});\ninputElem.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;focus&lt;/span&gt;();\ninputElem.&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt;();\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;This worked for me:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;lang-js s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; targetOffset = $(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;#elementToScrollTo&apos;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;offset&lt;/span&gt;().&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-property&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;;\n$(&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&apos;#DivParent&apos;&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-title function_&quot;&gt;animate&lt;/span&gt;({&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;scrollTop&lt;/span&gt;: targetOffset}, &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;2500&lt;/span&gt;);\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n    "]},"page":"4","randomQuestions":[{"title":"How do I make a redirect in PHP?","slug":"how-do-i-make-a-redirect-in-php-1657387381903"},{"title":"Why JSF calls getters multiple times","slug":"why-jsf-calls-getters-multiple-times-1657388244489"},{"title":"How to deal with mysqli problems? mysqli_fetch_array(): Argument #1 must be of type mysqli_result","slug":"how-to-deal-with-mysqli-problems-mysqli_fetch_array():-argument-1-must-be-of-type-mysqli_result-1657384360922"},{"title":"How to iterate over rows in a DataFrame in Pandas","slug":"how-to-iterate-over-rows-in-a-dataframe-in-pandas-1657387358115"},{"title":"How to append text to an existing file in Java?","slug":"how-to-append-text-to-an-existing-file-in-java-1657388492377"},{"title":"Event binding on dynamically created elements?","slug":"event-binding-on-dynamically-created-elements-1657384268057"},{"title":"Deserialize JSON into C# dynamic object?","slug":"deserialize-json-into-c-dynamic-object-1657388568720"},{"title":"How to read a file line-by-line into a list?","slug":"how-to-read-a-file-line-by-line-into-a-list-1657387865894"},{"title":"The difference between bracket [ ] and double bracket [[ ]] for accessing the elements of a list or dataframe","slug":"the-difference-between-bracket-and-double-bracket-for-accessing-the-elements-of-a-list-or-dataframe-1657388451711"},{"title":"Why not use Double or Float to represent currency?","slug":"why-not-use-double-or-float-to-represent-currency-1657387417964"},{"title":"HTTP GET with request body","slug":"http-get-with-request-body-1657387379038"},{"title":"What does ** (double star/asterisk) and * (star/asterisk) do for parameters?","slug":"what-does-**-(double-starasterisk)-and-*-(starasterisk)-do-for-parameters-1657384800967"},{"title":"Why can templates only be implemented in the header file?","slug":"why-can-templates-only-be-implemented-in-the-header-file-1657384341933"},{"title":"Randomize a List<T>","slug":"randomize-a-listlesstgreater-1657388172793"},{"title":"\"Cross origin requests are only supported for HTTP.\" error when loading a local file","slug":"\"cross-origin-requests-are-only-supported-for-http.\"-error-when-loading-a-local-file-1657387942403"},{"title":"Why is setTimeout(fn, 0) sometimes useful?","slug":"why-is-settimeout(fn-0)-sometimes-useful-1657388379869"},{"title":"How do I set, clear, and toggle a single bit?","slug":"how-do-i-set-clear-and-toggle-a-single-bit-1657388227052"},{"title":"AsyncTask Android example","slug":"asynctask-android-example-1657388127898"},{"title":"Which equals operator (== vs ===) should be used in JavaScript comparisons?","slug":"which-equals-operator-(-vs-)-should-be-used-in-javascript-comparisons-1657384663105"},{"title":"What happens if you use the 32-bit int 0x80 Linux ABI in 64-bit code?","slug":"what-happens-if-you-use-the-32-bit-int-0x80-linux-abi-in-64-bit-code-1657388560485"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
