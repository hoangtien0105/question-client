Arrow functions are a short syntax, introduced by ECMAscript 6, that can be used similarly to the way you would use function expressions. In other words, you can often use them in place of expressions like function (foo) {...}. But they have some important differences. For example, they do not bind their own values of this (see below for discussion).\nArrow functions are part of the ECMAscript 6 specification. They are not yet supported in all browsers, but they are partially or fully supported in Node v. 4.0+ and in most modern browsers in use as of 2018. (Ive included a partial list of supporting browsers below).\nYou can read more in the Mozilla documentation on arrow functions.\nFrom the Mozilla documentation:\n\nAn arrow function expression (also known as fat arrow function) has a shorter syntax compared to function expressions and lexically binds the this value (does not bind its own this, arguments, super, or new.target). Arrow functions are always anonymous. These function expressions are best suited for non-method functions and they can not be used as constructors.\n\nA Note on How this Works in Arrow Functions\nOne of the most handy features of an arrow function is buried in the text above:\n\nAn arrow function... lexically binds the this value (does not bind its own this...)\n\nWhat this means in simpler terms is that the arrow function retains the this value from its context and does not have its own this. A traditional function may bind its own this value, depending on how it is defined and called. This can require lots of gymnastics like self = this;, etc., to access or manipulate this from one function inside another function. For more info on this topic, see the explanation and examples in the Mozilla documentation.\nExample Code\nExample (also from the docs):\nvar a = [\n  &quot;We&apos;re up all night &apos;til the sun&quot;,\n  &quot;We&apos;re up all night to get some&quot;,\n  &quot;We&apos;re up all night for good fun&quot;,\n  &quot;We&apos;re up all night to get lucky&quot;\n];\n\n// These two assignments are equivalent:\n\n// Old-school:\nvar a2 = a.map(function(s){ return s.length });\n\n// ECMAscript 6 using arrow functions\nvar a3 = a.map( s =&gt; s.length );\n\n// both a2 and a3 will be equal to [31, 30, 31, 31]\n\n\nNotes on Compatibility\nYou can use arrow functions in Node, but browser support is spotty.\nBrowser support for this functionality has improved quite a bit, but it still is not widespread enough for most browser-based usages. As of December 12, 2017, it is supported in current versions of:\n\nChrome (v. 45+)\nFirefox (v. 22+)\nEdge (v. 12+)\nOpera (v. 32+)\nAndroid Browser (v. 47+)\nOpera Mobile (v. 33+)\nChrome for Android (v. 47+)\nFirefox for Android (v. 44+)\nSafari (v. 10+)\niOS Safari (v. 10.2+)\nSamsung Internet (v. 5+)\nBaidu Browser (v. 7.12+)\n\nNot supported in:\n\nIE (through v. 11)\nOpera Mini (through v. 8.0)\nBlackberry Browser (through v. 10)\nIE Mobile (through v. 11)\nUC Browser for Android (through v. 11.4)\nQQ (through v. 1.2)\n\nYou can find more (and more current) information at CanIUse.com (no affiliation).\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"That&apos;s known as an Arrow Function, part of the ECMAScript 2015 spec...\n\n\n\nvar foo = [&apos;a&apos;, &apos;ab&apos;, &apos;abc&apos;];\n\nvar bar = foo.map(f =&gt; f.length);\n\nconsole.log(bar); // 1,2,3\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\nShorter syntax than the previous:\n\n\n\n// &lt; ES6:\nvar foo = [&apos;a&apos;, &apos;ab&apos;, &apos;abc&apos;];\n\nvar bar = foo.map(function(f) {\n  return f.length;\n});\nconsole.log(bar); // 1,2,3\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\nDEMO\n\nThe other awesome thing is lexical this...

An ArrowFunction that references super\n  is always contained within a non-ArrowFunction and the necessary\n  state to implement super is accessible via the scope that is\n  captured by the function object of the ArrowFunction.\n\nThey are non-constructors.\n\nThat means they have no [[Construct]] internal method, and thus can&apos;t be instantiated, e.g.\n\nvar f = a =&gt; a;\nf(123);  // 123\nnew f(); // TypeError: f is not a constructor\n\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution6","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"I&apos;ve read, this is a symbol of Arrow Functions in ES6\n\nthis \n\nvar a2 = a.map(function(s){ return s.length });\n\n\nusing Arrow Function can be written as\n\nvar a3 = a.map( s =&gt; s.length );\n\n\nMDN Docs\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution7","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Dissatisfied with the other answers.

We didn&apos;t need function, nor return nor .bind(this) nor even braces or parentheses\nA slightly longer example of an arrow function might be\nconst foo = (width, height) =&gt; {\n  const area = width * height;\n  return area;\n};\n\nShowing that if we want multiple arguments to the function we need parentheses and if we want write more than a single expression we need braces and an explicit return.\nIt&apos;s important to understand the .bind part and it&apos;s a big topic. It has to do with what this means in JavaScript.\nALL functions have an implicit parameter called this. How this is set when calling a function depends on how that function is called.\nTake\nfunction foo() { console.log(this); }\n\nIf you call it normally\nfunction foo() { console.log(this); }\nfoo();\n\nthis will be the global object.\nIf you&apos;re in strict mode\n`use strict`;\nfunction foo() { console.log(this); }\nfoo();\n\n// or\n\nfunction foo() {\n   `use strict`;\n   console.log(this);\n }\nfoo();\n\nIt will be undefined\nYou can set this directly using call or apply\nfunction foo(msg) { console.log(msg, this); }\n\nconst obj1 = {abc: 123}\nconst obj2 = {def: 456}\n\nfoo.call(obj1, &apos;hello&apos;);  // prints Hello {abc: 123}\nfoo.apply(obj2, [&apos;hi&apos;]);  // prints Hi {def: 456}\n\nYou can also set this implicitly using the dot operator .\nfunction foo(msg) { console.log(msg, this); }\nconst obj = {\n   abc: 123,\n   bar: foo,\n}\nobj.bar(&apos;Hola&apos;);  // prints Hola {abc:123, bar: f}\n\nA problem comes up when you want to use a function as a callback or a listener. You make class and want to assign a function as the callback that accesses an instance of the class.\nclass ShowName {\n  constructor(name, elem) {\n    this.name = name;\n    elem.addEventListener(&apos;click&apos;, function() {\n       console.log(this.name);  // won&apos;t work\n    }); \n  }\n}\n\nThe code above will not work because when the element fires the event and calls the function the this value will not be the instance of the class.\nOne common way to solve that problem is to use .bind\nclass ShowName {\n  constructor(name, elem) {\n    this.name = name;\n    elem.addEventListener(&apos;click&apos;, function() {\n       console.log(this.name); \n    }.bind(this); // &lt;=========== ADDED! ===========\n  }\n}\n\nBecause the arrow syntax does the same thing we can write\nclass ShowName {\n  constructor(name, elem) {\n    this.name = name;\n    elem.addEventListener(&apos;click&apos;,() =&gt; {\n       console.log(this.name); \n    });\n  }\n}\n\nbind effectively makes a new function. If bind did not exist you could basically make your own like this\nfunction bind(functionToBind, valueToUseForThis) {\n  return function(...args) {\n    functionToBind.call(valueToUseForThis, ...args);\n  };\n}\n\nIn older JavaScript without the spread operator it would be\nfunction bind(functionToBind, valueToUseForThis) {\n  return function() {\n    functionToBind.apply(valueToUseForThis, arguments);\n  };\n}\n\nUnderstanding that code requires an understanding of closures but the short version is bind makes a new function that always calls the original function with the this value that was bound to it.

<h1>What It Is</h1>
<p><strong>This is an arrow function.</strong> Arrow functions are a short syntax, introduced by ECMAscript 6, that can be used similarly to the way you would use function expressions. In other words, you can often use them in place of expressions like <code>function (foo) {...}</code>. But they have some important differences. For example, they do not bind their own values of <code>this</code> (see below for discussion).</p>
<p>Arrow functions are part of the ECMAscript 6 specification. They are not yet supported in all browsers, but they are partially or fully supported <a href="https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/" rel="noreferrer">in Node v. 4.0+</a> and in most modern browsers in use as of 2018. (Ive included a partial list of supporting browsers below).</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/arrow_functions" rel="noreferrer">You can read more in <strong>the Mozilla documentation</strong> on arrow functions</a>.</p>
<p>From the Mozilla documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An arrow function expression (also known as fat arrow function) has a shorter syntax compared to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function" rel="noreferrer">function expressions</a> and lexically binds the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this" rel="noreferrer"><code>this</code></a> value (does not bind its own <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this" rel="noreferrer"><code>this</code></a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments" rel="noreferrer"><code>arguments</code></a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super" rel="noreferrer"><code>super</code></a>, or <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new.target" rel="noreferrer"><code>new.target</code></a>). Arrow functions are always anonymous. These function expressions are best suited for non-method functions and they can not be used as constructors.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>A Note on How <code>this</code> Works in Arrow Functions</h2>
<p>One of the most handy features of an arrow function is buried in the text above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An arrow function... lexically binds the <code>this</code> value (does not bind its own <code>this</code>...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this means in simpler terms is that the arrow function retains the <code>this</code> value from its context and does not have its own <code>this</code>. A traditional function <em>may</em> bind its own <code>this</code> value, depending on how it is defined and called. This can require lots of gymnastics like <code>self = this;</code>, etc., to access or manipulate <code>this</code> from one function inside another function. For more info on this topic, see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#Lexical_this" rel="noreferrer">the explanation and examples in the Mozilla documentation</a>.</p>

<h1>Notes on Compatibility</h1>
<p>You can use arrow functions in Node, but browser support is spotty.</p>
<p>Browser support for this functionality has improved quite a bit, but it still is not widespread enough for most browser-based usages. As of December 12, 2017, it is supported in current versions of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome (v. 45+)</li>
<li>Firefox (v. 22+)</li>
<li>Edge (v. 12+)</li>
<li>Opera (v. 32+)</li>
<li>Android Browser (v. 47+)</li>
<li>Opera Mobile (v. 33+)</li>
<li>Chrome for Android (v. 47+)</li>
<li>Firefox for Android (v. 44+)</li>
<li>Safari (v. 10+)</li>
<li>iOS Safari (v. 10.2+)</li>
<li>Samsung Internet (v. 5+)</li>
<li>Baidu Browser (v. 7.12+)</li>
</ul>
<p>Not supported in:</p>
<ul>
<li>IE (through v. 11)</li>
<li>Opera Mini (through v. 8.0)</li>
<li>Blackberry Browser (through v. 10)</li>

<h1>These are Arrow Functions</h1>
<p>Also known as <strong>Fat Arrow Functions</strong>. They're a clean and consise way to write function expressions, e.g. <code>function() {}</code>.</p>
<p>Arrow Functions can remove the need of <code>function</code>, <code>return</code> and <code>{}</code> when defining functions. They are one-liners, similar to Lambda Expressions in Java or Python.</p>
<h2>Example with no parameters</h2>
<p></p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> queue = [<span class="hljs-string">'Dave'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Sarah'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">'Sharon'</span>];

</div>
<p></p>
<p>If multiple statements need to be made within the same Arrow Function, you need to wrap, in this example, <code>queue[0]</code> in curley brackets <code>{}</code>. In this case the return statement cannot be omitted.</p>
<h2>Example with 1 parameter</h2>
<p></p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">

<p>You can omit <code>{}</code> from the above.</p>
<p>When there is a single parameter, the brackets <code>()</code> around the parameter can be omitted.</p>

<h2>A useful example</h2>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> fruits = [

];
</code></pre>
<p>If we wanted to get the price of every fruit in a single array, in ES5 we could do:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">fruits.<span class="hljs-title function_">map</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">fruit</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> fruit.<span class="hljs-property">price</span>;
}); <span class="hljs-comment">// [2, 3, 1]</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In ES6 with the new Arrow Functions, we can make this more concise:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">fruits.<span class="hljs-title function_">map</span>(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">fruit</span> =&gt;</span> fruit.<span class="hljs-property">price</span>); <span class="hljs-comment">// [2, 3, 1]</span>

<p>As others have said, it's a new syntax to create functions.</p>

<p>However, this kind of functions differ from normal ones:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They bind the <code>this</code> value. As explained by <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-arrow-function-definitions-runtime-semantics-evaluation" rel="noreferrer">the spec</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An <em>ArrowFunction</em> does not define local bindings for <code>arguments</code>,
  <code>super</code>, <code>this</code>, or <code>new.target</code>. Any reference to <code>arguments</code>,
  <code>super</code>, <code>this</code>, or <code>new.target</code> within an <em>ArrowFunction</em> must
  resolve to a binding in a lexically enclosing environment. Typically
  this will be the Function Environment of an immediately enclosing
  function.</p>
  
  <p>Even though an <em>ArrowFunction</em> may contain references to <code>super</code>, the
  function object created in step 4 is not made into a method by
  performing <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-makemethod" rel="noreferrer">MakeMethod</a>. An <em>ArrowFunction</em> that references <code>super</code>
  is always contained within a non-<em>ArrowFunction</em> and the necessary
  state to implement <code>super</code> is accessible via the <em>scope</em> that is
  captured by the function object of the <em>ArrowFunction</em>.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>They are non-constructors.</p>

<p>That means they have no [[Construct]] internal method, and thus can't be instantiated, e.g.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">f</span> = a =&gt; a;
<span class="hljs-title function_">f</span>(<span class="hljs-number">123</span>);  <span class="hljs-comment">// 123</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">f</span>(); <span class="hljs-comment">// TypeError: f is not a constructor</span>

<p>Dissatisfied with the other answers. The top voted answer as of 2019/3/13 is factually wrong.</p>
<p>The short terse version of what <code>=&gt;</code> means is it's a shortcut writing a function <strong>AND</strong> for binding it to the current <code>this</code></p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span> = a =&gt; a * <span class="hljs-number">2</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>Is effectively a shortcut for</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> foo = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">a</span>) { <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> a * <span class="hljs-number">2</span>; }.<span class="hljs-title function_">bind</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>You can see all the things that got shortened. We didn't need <code>function</code>, nor <code>return</code> nor <code>.bind(this)</code> nor even braces or parentheses</p>
<p>A slightly longer example of an arrow function might be</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span> = (<span class="hljs-params">width, height</span>) =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> area = width * height;
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> area;
};
</code></pre>
<p>Showing that if we want multiple arguments to the function we need parentheses and if we want write more than a single expression we need braces and an explicit <code>return</code>.</p>
<p>It's important to understand the <code>.bind</code> part and it's a big topic. It has to do with what <code>this</code> means in JavaScript.</p>
<p><strong>ALL</strong> functions have an implicit parameter called <code>this</code>. How <code>this</code> is set when calling a function depends on how that function is called.</p>
<p>Take</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) { <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>); }

<p>If you call it normally</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) { <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>); }

<span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>();
</code></pre>
<p>It will be <code>undefined</code></p>
<p>You can set <code>this</code> directly using <code>call</code> or <code>apply</code></p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">foo</span>(<span class="hljs-params">msg</span>) { <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(msg, <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>); }

<p>You can also set <code>this</code> implicitly using the dot operator <code>.</code></p>

<p>A problem comes up when you want to use a function as a callback or a listener. You make class and want to assign a function as the callback that accesses an instance of the class.</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">ShowName</span> {

    }); 
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The code above will not work because when the element fires the event and calls the function the <code>this</code> value will not be the instance of the class.</p>
<p>One common way to solve that problem is to use <code>.bind</code></p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">ShowName</span> {
  <span class="hljs-title function_">constructor</span>(<span class="hljs-params">name, elem</span>) {

  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Because the arrow syntax does the same thing we can write</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">ShowName</span> {
  <span class="hljs-title function_">constructor</span>(<span class="hljs-params">name, elem</span>) {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">this</span>.<span class="hljs-property">name</span> = name;
    elem.<span class="hljs-title function_">addEventListener</span>(<span class="hljs-string">'click'</span>,<span class="hljs-function">() =&gt;</span> {

    });
  }
}

<p><code>bind</code> effectively <em>makes a new function</em>. If <code>bind</code> did not exist you could basically make your own like this</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">bind</span>(<span class="hljs-params">functionToBind, valueToUseForThis</span>) {

    functionToBind.<span class="hljs-title function_">call</span>(valueToUseForThis, ...args);
  };

<p>In older JavaScript without the spread operator it would be</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">bind</span>(<span class="hljs-params">functionToBind, valueToUseForThis</span>) {

<p>Understanding that code requires <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures" rel="nofollow noreferrer">an understanding of closures</a> but the short version is <code>bind</code> makes a new function that always calls the original function with the <code>this</code> value that was bound to it. Arrow functions do the same thing since they are a shortcut for <code>bind(this)</code></p>

<p>Arrow functions which is denoted by symbol (=&gt;) helps you to create anonymous functions and methods. That leads to more shorter syntax. For example, below is a simple Add function which returns addition of two numbers.</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">Add</span>(<span class="hljs-params">num1 , num2 </span>){
<span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> num1 + num2;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above function becomes shorter by using Arrow syntax as shown below.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K4eFd.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/K4eFd.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>

<p>Above code has two parts as shown in the above diagram: -</p>

<p>Input:This section specifies the input parameters to the anonymous function.</p>

<p>Logic:This section comes after the symbol =&gt;. This section has the logic of the actual function.</p>

<p><em>Many developers think that arrow function makes your syntax shorter, simpler and thus makes your code readable.</em></p>

<p>If you believe the above sentence, then let me assure you its a myth. If you think for a moment a properly written function with name is much readable than cryptic functions created in one line using an arrow symbol.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The main use of arrow function is to ensure that code runs in the
  callers context.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See the below code in which have a global variable "context" defined , this global variable is accessed inside a function "SomeOtherMethod" which is called from other method "SomeMethod".</p>

<p>This "SomeMethod" has local "context" variable. Now because "SomeOtherMethod" is called from ""SomeMethod" we expect it to display "local context" , but it displays "global context".</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> context = <span class="hljs-variable language_">global</span> context;

<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">SomeOtherMethod</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){

}

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> instance = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">SomeMethod</span>();
</code></pre>

<p>But if replace the call by using Arrow function it will display "local context".</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> context = <span class="hljs-string">"global context"</span>;

    <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">SomeMethod</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>){

<p>As all of the other answers have already said, it's part of ES2015 arrow function syntax. More specifically, it's not an operator, it's a punctuator token that separates the parameters from the body: <code>ArrowFunction : ArrowParameters =&gt; ConciseBody</code>. E.g. <code>(params) =&gt; { /* body */ }</code>.</p>

<p>As others have stated, regular (traditional) functions use <code>this</code> from the object that called the function, <em>(e.g. a button that was clicked)</em>. Instead, arrow functions use <code>this</code> from the object that defines the function.</p>

<p>Consider two almost identical functions:</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript">regular = <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
  <span class="hljs-string">' Identical Part Here;

arrow = () =&gt; {
  '</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Identical</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Part</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Here</span>;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The snippet below demonstrates the fundamental difference between what <code>this</code> represents for each function.  The <strong><em>regular function</em></strong> outputs <code>[object HTMLButtonElement]</code> whereas the <strong><em>arrow function</em></strong> outputs <code>[object Window]</code>. </p>

<h2><code>ES6</code> Arrow functions:</h2>

<p>In javascript the <code>=&gt;</code> is the symbol of an arrow function expression. A arrow function expression does not have its own <code>this</code> binding and therefore cannot be used as a constructor function. for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>If there is <strong>exactly</strong> one argument you can omit the parentheses of the argument.</li>
<li>If you return an expression and do this on the same line you can omit the <code>{}</code> and the <code>return</code> statement</li>

<p>JavaScript arrow functions are roughly the equivalent of lambda functions in python or blocks in Ruby. <strong>These are anonymous functions</strong> with their own special syntax and <strong>operate in the context of their enclosing scope</strong>. This mean they do not have their own "this" but instead access the one from the immediate enclosing function.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/#sec-arrow-function-definitions-runtime-semantics-evaluation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ECMA standard</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An ArrowFunction does not define local bindings for <strong>arguments</strong>,
<strong>super</strong>, <strong>this</strong>, or <strong>new.target</strong>. Any reference to arguments, super, this, or new.target within an ArrowFunction must resolve to a
binding in a lexically enclosing environment. Typically this will be
the Function Environment of an immediately enclosing function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Often you can read "an arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression", this is not a correct. <strong>Arrow function are NOT a shorthand for traditional function</strong>, they behave differently that traditional function.</p>
