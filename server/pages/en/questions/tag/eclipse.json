This\n  will cause your &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; to break. Look\n  out for these erroneous import\n  statements and delete them.*&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While going through the Android sample tutorials, I would often use the &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;O&lt;/kbd&gt; command to &quot;Organize Imports&quot; and generate any missing import statements. Sometimes this would generate the incorrect import statement which would hide the &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; class that is automatically generated when you build.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Each time I had a problem with R not been generated, or even disappeared, this was due to some problem in the XML layout file that prevented the application from being built.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Whenever you get &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;R cannot be resolved&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;then check for the &lt;code&gt;/res&lt;/code&gt; directory and there must be some file that have some error in it and that is preventing the application from being built. For example, it may be a layout file or it may be due to some missing resource is, but you already defined it in the XML file.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any additional, even unused (!) or unreferenced (!) images in a folder like res/drawables-mdpi which do not comply to the file naming conventions (may contain only [a-z0-9_.]), the R.java class might not generate, causing the chain of events all the other posts referred to. Hope it helps!&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;my project have include a r.java.at the beginning ,R.layout.main work good.But,after adding some code it doesn&apos;t work,and the error is R.layout.main can&apos;t resolved.what&apos;s the problem?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look at your imports. Chances are that the line:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;default s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-cpp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; android.R;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;will be there. If that&apos;s the case, remove it, so that your project will resolve R not with the default Android Resources class, but with the one auto-generated from your /res/ folder.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;And another thing which may cause this problem:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I installed the new ADT (v. 22). It stopped creating &lt;code&gt;gen&lt;/code&gt; folder which includes &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt;. The solution was to also install new Android SDK Build Tools from Android SDK Manager.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Solution found &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/android-developers/rCaeT3qckoE&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;What Will said was right&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;R is an automatically generated class that holds the constants used to identify your &amp;gt;resources. If you don&apos;t have an R.java file (it would be gen/eu.mauriziopz.gps/R.java in &amp;gt;Eclipse with the 1.5 SDK) I would recommend closing and reopening your project or going to &amp;gt;Project &amp;gt; Build all (and selecting &quot;Build Automatically&quot; while there as recommended by &amp;gt;Josef). If that doesn&apos;t work than try making a new project, if the problem is recreated than &amp;gt;post here again and we&apos;ll go into more detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but I&apos;ve found out that there was another problem that was causing the first one. The tools in the SDK directory didn&apos;t have the permissions to be executed, so it was like the didn&apos;t exist for Eclipse, thus it didn&apos;t build the &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So modifying the permission and selecting &quot;Build Automatically&quot; solved the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; is a file that the Android Eclipse plugins creates while\nbuilding your application. &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; is created under the &quot;gen&quot;\ndirectory. This file is generated from the information in the &quot;res&quot;\ndirectory. If you run select &quot;Project&quot; -&amp;gt; &quot;Clean...&quot; on the Eclipse\nmenu, it will remove and then regenerate the &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem &quot;R cannot be resolved&quot; happens when you change your\npackage name in the &lt;code&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/code&gt; file. It uses your Android\npackage name to create a subdirectory under the &quot;gen&quot; directory where\nit stores the &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eclipse may have problems executing clean, because it is confused about\nwhere the &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; file is when you have changed the Android package\nname. You can either rename the subdirectory under &lt;code&gt;gen&lt;/code&gt; to match your\nnew package name, or you can change your package name back to the old\nname. Do the clean and then change the package name to the new name\nyou want. This works best if you stop Eclipse from trying to build\nwhile you are changing the package name. Under the &quot;Project&quot; menu\nuncheck the option to &quot;Build Automatically&quot; and also when the\n&quot;Clean...&quot; dialog asks if it should &quot;Start a build immediately&quot;\nuncheck the box so it doesn&apos;t try to build while you are changing the\npackage name. After you have changed the name you can turn &quot;Build\nAutomatically&quot; back on again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Note that if your &lt;code&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/code&gt; file package name does not match\nyour Java package name, Eclipse will end up automatically adding an\n&quot;import &amp;lt;your Android package name&amp;gt;.R;&quot; line in all your &lt;code&gt;.java&lt;/code&gt; files\nthat have any references to R. If you change your &lt;code&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/code&gt;\npackage name, sometimes Eclipse does not update all of these added\nimports. If that happens, use the Eclipse refactoring (&lt;kbd&gt;ALT&lt;/kbd&gt; +\n&lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;R&lt;/kbd&gt;) to change the import statement in one of your Java files to\nyour new &lt;code&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/code&gt; package name. It is best to do this\nwhile you have disabled &quot;Build Automatically&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;R is an automatically generated class that holds the constants used to identify your resources.  If you don&apos;t have an R.java file (it would be gen/eu.mauriziopz.gps/R.java in Eclipse with the 1.5 SDK) I would recommend closing and reopening your project or going to Project &amp;gt; Build all (and selecting &quot;Build Automatically&quot; while there as recommended by Josef).  If that doesn&apos;t work than try making a new project, if the problem is recreated than post here again and we&apos;ll go into more detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Close all files, clean project, restart Eclipse.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;It is worth checking in &lt;code&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/code&gt;. The attribute &lt;code&gt;package&lt;/code&gt; has the correct value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;default s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-go&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;manifest xmlns:android=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;&lt;/span&gt;\n   &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;package&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;your.correct.package.name&quot;&lt;/span&gt;\n   ...\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After you change that, the &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; will be re-generated.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;This error can also be caused by adding an activity to a namespace that is different to the root namespace for your package.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, if &lt;code&gt;com.example.myapp&lt;/code&gt; is the root namespace for your package, you can then add an activity to the &lt;code&gt;com.example.myapp.activities&lt;/code&gt; namespace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This will produce the &quot;R cannot be resolved&quot; error.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To fix the import the R in the default namespace in your activity should be:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;default s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-cpp&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; com.example.myapp.R;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Along with the great suggestions in the previous answers, make sure your Android target is set:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Right-click on your project&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Choose Properties &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Choose Android in the left menu &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tick a box next to the appropriate Project Build Target.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Click Apply and OK&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: A year later I found another cause.  I had a .jpg image in my drawable folder with the same name as a .png image.  Referencing this image in my code must have confused the program and it gave the &quot;R cannot be resolved&quot; error.  &lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Make sure you installed the Android build tool form sdk manager&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;project right click properties-&amp;gt; Java BuildPath select Library and add android-support.jar the follow these step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go to Project-&amp;gt;Properties-&amp;gt;Java Build Path than select Order and export tab. Set android-support .jar library checked and up it into top of the list. And clean and rebuild..It works for most of the cases&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/StAV6.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;I just had this problem for the millionth time and realized what was causing it: I created an XML file with uppercase letters in the name. All your XML filenames in &lt;code&gt;/res&lt;/code&gt; must match &lt;code&gt;[a-z0-9\\\\._]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Simplest solution - Sometimes you just need to save the XML file you were working on to get the autogenerator to kick in.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Save the file (e.g. main.xml) then delete the R.java file and see if the regenerated R.java resolves the R resolve problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Check the XML file names.  Be sure that they&apos;re all in lowercase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also make sure that any image resource names are also all in LOWER CASE. I had a capital letter in the name of my jpg file, and it caused the R unresolved error right across my project.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; is a generated class. If you are using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/eclipse-adt.html&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Android Development Tools (ADT)&lt;/a&gt; it is generated whenever the project is built. You may have &apos;Build Automatically&apos; turned off.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;This error cropped up on my x64 Linux Mint installation. It turned out that the result was a failure in the &lt;code&gt;ADB&lt;/code&gt; binary, because the &lt;code&gt;ia32-libs&lt;/code&gt; package was not installed. Simply running &lt;code&gt;apt-get install ia32-libs&lt;/code&gt; and relaunching Eclipse fixed the error.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your x64 distro does not have ia32-libs, you&apos;ll have to go Multiarch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check #4 and #5 on this post:\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=277883#p277883&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?pid=277883#p277883&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps someone.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;You may need to update/install SDK tools. Relaunch Android SDK Manager again and install a new item: Android SDK Build-tools.one by one delete,fix which one work for you.&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/HAnom.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/HAnom.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;I had this problem as well. It turned out that I had inadvertently deleted the &quot;app_name&quot; string resource from the &lt;code&gt;strings.xml&lt;/code&gt; file, which was causing a silent error. Once I added it back, the R class was generated successfully and everything was back up and running.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;You may need to update SDK tools. Relaunch Android SDK Manager again and install a new item: Android SDK Build-tools. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/iMoT8.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Try to make your new XML layout file name lower case. For example, use &lt;code&gt;my_file.xml&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;myFile.xml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Yet another reason &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; might not get autogenerated is if you have directories like &lt;strong&gt;res/drawable-hdpi&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;res/drawable-mdpi&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;res/drawable-ldpi&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1.6+ seems to be OK with these directories, but 1.5 doesn&apos;t want them. When I removed those directories, &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; started autogenerating for me again.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Often times this is because of the MinSDK version number you supplied when creating the project.  Example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want 2.1 to be the minimum, Android 2.1 is actually API Level 7.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can see what I am talking about when you browse the SDK you downloaded and installed.  Navigate to the place you installed the SDK to (&lt;code&gt;C:\\android-sdk-windows&lt;/code&gt; for example) and open the folder named &quot;platforms&quot;. You will see something like &quot;android-7&quot; listed as a folder, and if you open that there is a &lt;code&gt;source.properties&lt;/code&gt; file that, when opened with a text editor, will show you the corresponding platform version.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you create a project, and you must select a &quot;Build Target&quot; API, the last column in that list named &quot;API Level&quot; shows the number you are looking for when populating the MinSDK setting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is probably one of the most common mistakes that results in the &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt; file not being created under Project &amp;gt; gen &amp;gt; packagename &amp;gt; R.java.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Remove &lt;code&gt;main.out.xml&lt;/code&gt;. I&apos;m new to this and don&apos;t yet know what this file is used for, but removing it cleared the problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;Just go to Android Top menu list. click on &lt;strong&gt;Build&lt;/strong&gt; Menu, in under Build click on &lt;strong&gt;Rebuild Project&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/u255F.png&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/u255F.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;First check is there any error in any xml layout or not, if then resolve it first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise remove junit dependency from project and rebuild the project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ElDnv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ElDnv.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;In case anyone is interested (I might be saving your life here), I had the error, &lt;code&gt;R.xml&lt;/code&gt; cannot be resolved, slightly different on a GLS project. Hmmmm. After looking in &lt;code&gt;R.java&lt;/code&gt;, I found an auto-generated class, &lt;code&gt;XML.java&lt;/code&gt;, (I think) was not there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Solution? It needed a new folder in &lt;code&gt;res&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;res\\xml&lt;/code&gt; and a file called &lt;code&gt;default_values.xml&lt;/code&gt;\nin there. Then all was OK.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just in case you have not got that file, it&apos;s:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;default s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-meta&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;1.0&quot;&lt;/span&gt; encoding=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;utf-8&quot;&lt;/span&gt;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;PreferenceScreen&lt;/span&gt;\n    &lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;xmlns:android&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-string&quot;&gt;&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-tag&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-name&quot;&gt;PreferenceScreen&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;So I have run into this problem multiple times when switching build targets.  Usually doing a Project &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Clean worked for me.  This last time, however, it did not.  Finally I tried to open my default.properties file, located under the root project folder.  I received an error message stating that it was out of sync with the file system.  I actually deleted it and copied a coworkers version which allowed eclipse to rebuild my R file.  I will paste what it looks like below.  It is named &apos;default.properties&apos;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre class=&quot;default s-code-block&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;hljs language-ini&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;# This file is automatically generated by Android Tools.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;# Do not modify this file -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE ERASED!&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;# &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;# This file must be checked in Version Control Systems.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;# &lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;# To customize properties used by the Ant build system use,&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;# &quot;build.properties&quot;, and override values to adapt the script to your&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;# project structure.&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;# Indicates whether an apk should be generated for each density.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;split.density&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-literal&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-comment&quot;&gt;# Project target.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-attr&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;=android-&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-number&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n    ","\n&lt;p&gt;I had the examples of Android 8 and was trying to use Android 7 SDK.
