Facebook engineers had a great talk about it.

Win32 file system interfaces provide streaming access to the data.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\n  FILESTREAM uses the NT system cache for caching file data. This helps reduce any effect that FILESTREAM data might have on Database Engine performance. The SQL Server buffer pool is not used; therefore, this memory is available for query processing.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;File paths in the DB is \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;definitely\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; the way to go - I\u0026apos;ve heard story after story from customers with TB of images that it became a nightmare trying to store any significant amount of images in a DB - the performance hit alone is too much.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In my experience, sometimes the simplest solution is to \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;name the images according to the primary key\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;. So it\u0026apos;s easy to find the image that belongs to a particular record, and vice versa. But at the same time you\u0026apos;re not storing \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;anything\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; about the image in the database.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The trick here is to not become a zealot. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;One thing to note here is that no one in the pro file system camp has listed a particular file system. Does this mean that everything from FAT16 to ZFS handily beats every database?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;No. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The truth is that many databases beat many files systems, even when we\u0026apos;re only talking about raw speed.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The correct course of action is to make the right decision for your precise scenario, and to do that, you\u0026apos;ll need some numbers and some use case estimates.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In places where you MUST guarantee referential integrity and ACID compliance, storing images in the database is required.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You cannot transactionaly guarantee that the image and the meta-data about that image stored in the database refer to the same file. In other words, it is impossible to guarantee that the file on the filesystem is only ever altered at the same time and in the same transaction as the metadata.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;As others have said SQL 2008 comes with a Filestream type that allows you to store a filename or identifier as a pointer in the db and automatically stores the image on your filesystem which is a great scenario.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If you\u0026apos;re on an older database, then I\u0026apos;d say that if you\u0026apos;re storing it as blob data, then you\u0026apos;re really not going to get anything out of the database in the way of searching features, so it\u0026apos;s probably best to store an address on a filesystem, and store the image that way.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;That way you also save space on your filesystem, as you are only going to save the exact amount of space, or even compacted space on the filesystem.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Also, you could decide to save with some structure or elements that allow you to browse the raw images in your filesystem without any db hits, or transfer the files in bulk to another system, hard drive, S3 or another scenario - updating the location in your program, but keep the structure, again without much of a hit trying to bring the images out of your db when trying to increase storage.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Probably, it would also allow you to throw some caching element, based on commonly hit image urls into your web engine/program, so you\u0026apos;re saving yourself there as well.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Small static images (not more than a couple of megs) that are not frequently edited, should be stored in the database. This method has several benefits including easier portability (images are transferred with the database), easier backup/restore (images are backed up with the database) and better scalability (a file system folder with thousands of little thumbnail files sounds like a scalability nightmare to me).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Serving up images from a database is easy, just implement an http handler that serves the byte array returned from the DB server as a binary stream.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Here\u0026apos;s an interesting white paper on the topic.  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://research.microsoft.com/research/pubs/view.aspx?msr_tr_id=MSR-TR-2006-45\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;To BLOB or Not To BLOB: Large Object Storage in a Database or a Filesystem\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The answer is \u0026quot;It depends.\u0026quot;  Certainly it would depend upon the database server and its approach to blob storage.  It also depends on the type of data being stored in blobs, as well as how that data is to be accessed.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Smaller sized files can be efficiently stored and delivered using the database as the storage mechanism.  Larger files would probably be best stored using the file system, especially if they will be modified/updated often.  (blob fragmentation becomes an issue in regards to performance.)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Here\u0026apos;s an additional point to keep in mind.  One of the reasons supporting the use of a database to store the blobs is ACID compliance.  However, the approach that the testers used in the white paper, (Bulk Logged option of SQL Server,) which doubled SQL Server throughput, effectively changed the \u0026apos;D\u0026apos; in ACID to a \u0026apos;d,\u0026apos; as the blob data was not logged with the initial writes for the transaction.   Therefore, if full ACID compliance is an important requirement for your system, halve the SQL Server throughput figures for database writes when comparing file I/O to database blob I/O.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;One thing that I haven\u0026apos;t seen anyone mention yet but is definitely worth noting is that there are issues associated with storing large amounts of images in most filesystems too.  For example if you take the approach mentioned above and name each image file after the primary key, on most filesystems you will run into issues if you try to put all of the images in one big directory once you reach a very large number of images (e.g. in the hundreds of thousands or millions).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Once common solution to this is to hash them out into a balanced tree of subdirectories.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Something nobody has mentioned is that the DB guarantees atomic actions, transactional integrity and deals with concurrency.

This buys you the capability of multiple web servers and fewer sync issues.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I\u0026apos;m not sure how much of a \u0026quot;real world\u0026quot; example this is, but I currently have an application out there that stores details for a trading card game, including the images for the cards. Granted the record count for the database is only 2851 records to date, but given the fact that certain cards have are released multiple times and have alternate artwork, it was actually more efficient sizewise to scan the \u0026quot;primary square\u0026quot; of the artwork and then dynamically generate the border and miscellaneous effects for the card when requested.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The original creator of this image library created a data access class that renders the image based on the request, and it does it quite fast for viewing and individual card.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This also eases deployment/updates when new cards are released, instead of zipping up an entire folder of images and sending those down the pipe and ensuring the proper folder structure is created, I simply update the database and have the user download it again. This currently sizes up to 56MB, which isn\u0026apos;t great, but I\u0026apos;m working on an incremental update feature for future releases. In addition, there is a \u0026quot;no images\u0026quot; version of the application that allows those over dial-up to get the application without the download delay.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This solution has worked great to date since the application itself is targeted as a single instance on the desktop. There is a web site where all of this data is archived for online access, but I would in no way use the same solution for this. I agree the file access would be preferable because it would scale better to the frequency and volume of requests being made for the images.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Hopefully this isn\u0026apos;t too much babble, but I saw the topic and wanted to provide some my insights from a relatively successful small/medium scale application.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;SQL Server 2008 offers a solution that has the best of both worlds : \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc716724.aspx\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;nofollow noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;The filestream data type\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Manage it like a regular table and have the performance of the file system.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;It depends on the number of images you are going to store and also their sizes. I have used databases to store images in the past and my experience has been fairly good. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;IMO, Pros of using database to store images are,\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A. You don\u0026apos;t need FS structure to hold your images\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nB. Database indexes perform better than FS trees when more number of items are to be stored\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nC. Smartly tuned database perform good job at caching the query results\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nD. Backups are simple. It also works well if you have replication set up and content is delivered from a server near to user. In such cases, explicit synchronization is not required.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If your images are going to be small (say \u0026amp;lt; 64k) and the storage engine of your db supports inline (in record) BLOBs, it improves performance further as no indirection is required (Locality of reference is achieved). \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Storing images may be a bad idea when you are dealing with small number of huge sized images. Another problem with storing images in db is that, metadata like creation, modification dates must handled by your application.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I have recently created a PHP/MySQL app which stores PDFs/Word files in a MySQL table (as big as 40MB per file so far).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Pros:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Uploaded files are replicated to backup server along with everything else, no separate backup strategy is needed (peace of mind).\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Setting up the web server is slightly simpler because I don\u0026apos;t need to have an uploads/ folder and tell all my applications where it is.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;I get to use transactions for edits to improve data integrity - I don\u0026apos;t have to worry about orphaned and missing files\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Cons:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;mysqldump now takes a looooong time because there is 500MB of file data in one of the tables.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Overall not very memory/cpu efficient when compared to filesystem\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I\u0026apos;d call my implementation a success, it takes care of backup requirements and simplifies the layout of the project.

So sometimes there are also design considerations that will drive you to a choice.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Consider also, when making this choice, if you have to deal with permission and authentication when accessing binary objects: these requisites normally can be solved in an easier way when data are stored in db.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I once worked on an image processing application. We stored the uploaded images in a directory that was something like /images/[today\u0026apos;s date]/[id number].

If there are no file paths to use, and all images are streamed straight out of the DB, there\u0026apos;s no danger of a user finding files they shouldn\u0026apos;t have access to.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;That seems like it would be better solved with an intermediary script pulling data from a web-inaccessible file store, though.

When the alternative - storing images on file servers and paths in the database is so much easier, why bother?
