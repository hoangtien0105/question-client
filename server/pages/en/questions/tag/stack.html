stack is the memory set aside as scratch space for a thread of execution.  When a function is called, a block is reserved on the top of the stack for local variables and some bookkeeping data.  When that function returns, the block becomes unused and can be used the next time a function is called.  The stack is always reserved in a LIFO (last in first out) order; the most recently reserved block is always the next block to be freed.  This makes it really simple to keep track of the stack; freeing a block from the stack is nothing more than adjusting one pointer.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The heap is memory set aside for dynamic allocation.  Unlike the stack, there\u0026apos;s no enforced pattern to the allocation and deallocation of blocks from the heap; you can allocate a block at any time and free it at any time.  This makes it much more complex to keep track of which parts of the heap are allocated or free at any given time; there are many custom heap allocators available to tune heap performance for different usage patterns.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Each thread gets a stack, while there\u0026apos;s typically only one heap for the application (although it isn\u0026apos;t uncommon to have multiple heaps for different types of allocation).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;To answer your questions directly:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;To what extent are they controlled by the OS or language runtime?\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The OS allocates the stack for each system-level thread when the thread is created.  Typically the OS is called by the language runtime to allocate the heap for the application.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;What is their scope?\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The stack is attached to a thread, so when the thread exits the stack is reclaimed.  The heap is typically allocated at application startup by the runtime, and is reclaimed when the application (technically process) exits.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;What determines the size of each of them?\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The size of the stack is set when a thread is created.  The size of the heap is set on application startup, but can grow as space is needed (the allocator requests more memory from the operating system).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;What makes one faster?\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The stack is faster because the access pattern makes it trivial to allocate and deallocate memory from it (a pointer/integer is simply incremented or decremented), while the heap has much more complex bookkeeping involved in an allocation or deallocation.  Also, each byte in the stack tends to be reused very frequently which means it tends to be mapped to the processor\u0026apos;s cache, making it very fast. Another performance hit for the heap is that the heap, being mostly a global resource, typically has to be multi-threading safe, i.e. each allocation and deallocation needs to be - typically - synchronized with \u0026quot;all\u0026quot; other heap accesses in the program.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A clear demonstration:\n\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/i6k0Z.png\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;sub\u0026gt;Image source: \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://vikashazrati.wordpress.com/2007/10/01/quicktip-java-basics-stack-and-heap/\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;vikashazrati.wordpress.com\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/sub\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Stack:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Stored in computer RAM just like the heap.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Variables created on the stack will go out of scope and are automatically deallocated.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Much faster to allocate in comparison to variables on the heap.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Implemented with an actual stack data structure.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Stores local data, return addresses, used for parameter passing.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Can have a stack overflow when too much of the stack is used (mostly from infinite or too deep recursion, very large allocations).\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Data created on the stack can be used without pointers.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;You would use the stack if you know exactly how much data you need to allocate before compile time and it is not too big.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Usually has a maximum size already determined when your program starts.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Heap:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Stored in computer RAM just like the stack.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;In C++, variables on the heap must be destroyed manually and never fall out of scope.

You can reach in and remove items in any order because there is no clear \u0026apos;top\u0026apos; item.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/kINqo.jpg\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;Heap like a heap of licorice allsorts\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Heap allocation requires maintaining a full record of what memory is allocated and what isn\u0026apos;t, as well as some overhead maintenance to reduce fragmentation, find contiguous memory segments big enough to fit the requested size, and so on.  Memory can be deallocated at any time leaving free space.  Sometimes a memory allocator will perform maintenance tasks such as defragmenting memory by moving allocated memory around, or garbage collecting - identifying at runtime when memory is no longer in scope and deallocating it. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;These images should do a fairly good job of describing the two ways of allocating and freeing memory in a stack and a heap.  Yum!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;To what extent are they controlled by the OS or language runtime?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;As mentioned, heap and stack are general terms, and can be implemented in many ways.  Computer programs typically have a stack called a \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;call stack\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; which stores information relevant to the current function such as a pointer to whichever function it was called from, and any local variables.  Because functions call other functions and then return, the stack grows and shrinks to hold information from the functions further down the call stack.  A program doesn\u0026apos;t really have runtime control over it; it\u0026apos;s determined by the programming language, OS and even the system architecture.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A heap is a general term used for any memory that is allocated dynamically and randomly; i.e. out of order.  The memory is typically allocated by the OS, with the application calling API functions to do this allocation.  There is a fair bit of overhead required in managing dynamically allocated memory, which is usually handled by the runtime code of the programming language or environment used.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;What is their scope?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The call stack is such a low level concept that it doesn\u0026apos;t relate to \u0026apos;scope\u0026apos; in the sense of programming.  If you disassemble some code you\u0026apos;ll see relative pointer style references to portions of the stack, but as far as a higher level language is concerned, the language imposes its own rules of scope.  One important aspect of a stack, however, is that once a function returns, anything local to that function is immediately freed from the stack.  That works the way you\u0026apos;d expect it to work given how your programming languages work.  In a heap, it\u0026apos;s also difficult to define.  The scope is whatever is exposed by the OS, but your programming language probably adds its rules about what a \u0026quot;scope\u0026quot; is in your application.  The processor architecture and the OS use virtual addressing, which the processor translates to physical addresses and there are page faults, etc.  They keep track of what pages belong to which applications.  You never really need to worry about this, though, because you just use whatever method your programming language uses to allocate and free memory, and check for errors (if the allocation/freeing fails for any reason).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;What determines the size of each of them?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Again, it depends on the language, compiler, operating system and architecture.  A stack is usually pre-allocated, because by definition it must be contiguous memory.  The language compiler or the OS determine its size.  You don\u0026apos;t store huge chunks of data on the stack, so it\u0026apos;ll be big enough that it should never be fully used, except in cases of unwanted endless recursion (hence, \u0026quot;stack overflow\u0026quot;) or other unusual programming decisions.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A heap is a general term for anything that can be dynamically allocated.  Depending on which way you look at it, it is constantly changing size.  In modern processors and operating systems the exact way it works is very abstracted anyway, so you don\u0026apos;t normally need to worry much about how it works deep down, except that (in languages where it lets you) you mustn\u0026apos;t use memory that you haven\u0026apos;t allocated yet or memory that you have freed.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;What makes one faster?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The stack is faster because all free memory is always contiguous.  No list needs to be maintained of all the segments of free memory, just a single pointer to the current top of the stack.  Compilers usually store this pointer in a special, fast \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_register\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;register\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; for this purpose.  What\u0026apos;s more, subsequent operations on a stack are usually concentrated within very nearby areas of memory, which at a very low level is good for optimization by the processor on-die caches.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;(I have moved this answer from another question that was more or less a dupe of this one.)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The answer to your question is implementation specific and may vary across compilers and processor architectures. However, here is a simplified explanation.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Both the stack and the heap are memory areas allocated from the underlying operating system (often virtual memory that is mapped to physical memory on demand).\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;In a multi-threaded environment each thread will have its own completely independent stack but they will share the heap. Concurrent access has to be controlled on the heap and is not possible on the stack.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;The heap\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;The heap contains a linked list of used and free blocks. New allocations on the heap (by \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;new\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;malloc\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;) are satisfied by creating a suitable block from one of the free blocks. This requires updating the list of blocks on the heap. This \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;meta information\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; about the blocks on the heap is also stored on the heap often in a small area just in front of every block.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;As the heap grows new blocks are often allocated from lower addresses towards higher addresses. Thus you can think of the heap as a \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;heap\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; of memory blocks that grows in size as memory is allocated. If the heap is too small for an allocation the size can often be increased by acquiring more memory from the underlying operating system.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Allocating and deallocating many small blocks may leave the heap in a state where there are a lot of small free blocks interspersed between the used blocks. A request to allocate a large block may fail because none of the free blocks are large enough to satisfy the allocation request even though the combined size of the free blocks may be large enough. This is called \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;heap fragmentation\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;When a used block that is adjacent to a free block is deallocated the new free block may be merged with the adjacent free block to create a larger free block effectively reducing the fragmentation of the heap.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/0Obi0.png\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;The heap\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;The stack\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;The stack often works in close tandem with a special register on the CPU named the \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;stack pointer\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;. Initially the stack pointer points to the top of the stack (the highest address on the stack).\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;The CPU has special instructions for \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;pushing\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; values onto the stack and \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;popping\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; them off the stack. Each \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;push\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; stores the value at the current location of the stack pointer and decreases the stack pointer. A \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;pop\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; retrieves the value pointed to by the stack pointer and then increases the stack pointer (don\u0026apos;t be confused by the fact that \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;adding\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; a value to the stack \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;decreases\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; the stack pointer and \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;removing\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; a value \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;increases\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; it. Remember that the stack grows to the bottom). The values stored and retrieved are the values of the CPU registers.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;If a function has parameters, these are pushed onto the stack before the call to the function. The code in the function is then able to navigate up the stack from the current stack pointer to locate these values.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;When a function is called the CPU uses special instructions that push the current \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;instruction pointer\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; onto the stack, i.e. the address of the code executing on the stack. The CPU then jumps to the function by setting the instruction pointer to the address of the function called. Later, when the function returns, the old instruction pointer is popped off the stack and execution resumes at the code just after the call to the function.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;When a function is entered, the stack pointer is decreased to allocate more space on the stack for local (automatic) variables. If the function has one local 32 bit variable four bytes are set aside on the stack. When the function returns, the stack pointer is moved back to free the allocated area.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Nesting function calls work like a charm. Each new call will allocate function parameters, the return address and space for local variables and these \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;activation records\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; can be stacked for nested calls and will unwind in the correct way when the functions return.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;As the stack is a limited block of memory, you can cause a \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;stack overflow\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; by calling too many nested functions and/or allocating too much space for local variables. Often the memory area used for the stack is set up in such a way that writing below the bottom (the lowest address) of the stack will trigger a trap or exception in the CPU. This exceptional condition can then be caught by the runtime and converted into some kind of stack overflow exception.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/9UshP.png\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;The stack\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Can a function be allocated on the heap instead of a stack?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;No, activation records for functions (i.e. local or automatic variables) are allocated on the stack that is used not only to store these variables, but also to keep track of nested function calls.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;How the heap is managed is really up to the runtime environment. C uses \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;malloc\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and C++ uses \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;new\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, but many other languages have garbage collection.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;However, the stack is a more low-level feature closely tied to the processor architecture. Growing the heap when there is not enough space isn\u0026apos;t too hard since it can be implemented in the library call that handles the heap. However, growing the stack is often impossible as the stack overflow only is discovered when it is too late; and shutting down the thread of execution is the only viable option.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In the following C# code\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-cs s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-csharp\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-function\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;public\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;void\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Method1\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;()\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n{\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;int\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; i = \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-number\u0026quot;\u0026gt;4\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;;\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;int\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; y = \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-number\u0026quot;\u0026gt;2\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;;\n    class1 cls1 = \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;new\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; class1();\n}\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Here\u0026apos;s how the memory is managed\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/NS0k7.jpg\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;Picture of variables on the stack\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Local Variables\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; that only need to last as long as the function invocation go in the stack.

Some info (such as where to go on return) is also stored there.\nWhen you declare a variable inside your function, that variable is also allocated on the stack. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Deallocating the stack is pretty simple because you always deallocate in the reverse order in which you allocate. Stack stuff is added as you enter functions, the corresponding data is removed as you exit them. This means that you tend to stay within a small region of the stack unless you call lots of functions that call lots of other functions (or create a recursive solution).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;The Heap\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\nThe heap is a generic name for where you put the data that you create on the fly. If you don\u0026apos;t know how many spaceships your program is going to create, you are likely to use the new (or malloc or equivalent) operator to create each spaceship. This allocation is going to stick around for a while, so it is likely we will free things in a different order than we created them. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Thus, the heap is far more complex, because there end up being regions of memory that are unused interleaved with chunks that are - memory gets fragmented. Finding free memory of the size you need is a difficult problem. This is why the heap should be avoided (though it is still often used).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Implementation\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\nImplementation of both the stack and heap is usually down to the runtime / OS. Often games and other applications that are performance critical create their own memory solutions that grab a large chunk of memory from the heap and then dish it out internally to avoid relying on the OS for memory. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This is only practical if your memory usage is quite different from the norm - i.e for games where you load a level in one huge operation and can chuck the whole lot away in another huge operation.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Physical location in memory\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\nThis is less relevant than you think because of a technology called \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Virtual Memory\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; which makes your program think that you have access to a certain address where the physical data is somewhere else (even on the hard disc!). The addresses you get for the stack are in increasing order as your call tree gets deeper. The addresses for the heap are un-predictable (i.e implimentation specific) and frankly not important.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Other answers just avoid explaining what static allocation means. So I will explain the three main forms of allocation and how they usually relate to the heap, stack, and data segment below. I also will show some examples in both C/C++ and Python to help people understand.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026quot;Static\u0026quot; (AKA statically allocated) variables are not allocated on the stack. Do not assume so - many people do only because \u0026quot;static\u0026quot; sounds a lot like \u0026quot;stack\u0026quot;. They actually exist in neither the stack nor the heap. They are part of what\u0026apos;s called the \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_segment\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;data segment\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;However, it is generally better to consider \u0026quot;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;scope\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;lifetime\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026quot; rather than \u0026quot;stack\u0026quot; and \u0026quot;heap\u0026quot;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Scope refers to what parts of the code can access a variable. Generally we think of \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;local scope\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; (can only be accessed by the current function) versus \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;global scope\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; (can be accessed anywhere) although scope can get much more complex.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Lifetime refers to when a variable is allocated and deallocated during program execution. Usually we think of \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;static allocation\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; (variable will persist through the entire duration of the program, making it useful for storing the same information across several function calls) versus \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;automatic allocation\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; (variable only persists during a single call to a function, making it useful for storing information that is only used during your function and can be discarded once you are done) versus \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;dynamic allocation\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; (variables whose duration is defined at runtime, instead of compile time like static or automatic).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Although most compilers and interpreters implement this behavior similarly in terms of using stacks, heaps, etc, a compiler may sometimes break these conventions if it wants as long as behavior is correct. For instance, due to optimization a local variable may only exist in a register or be removed entirely, even though most local variables exist in the stack. As has been pointed out in a few comments, you are free to implement a compiler that doesn\u0026apos;t even use a stack or a heap, but instead some other storage mechanisms (rarely done, since stacks and heaps are great for this).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I will provide some simple annotated C code to illustrate all of this. The best way to learn is to run a program under a debugger and watch the behavior.

Such variables can make our common but informal naming habits very confusing. For instance when we say \u0026quot;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;local\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026quot; we usually mean \u0026quot;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;locally scoped automatically allocated variable\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026quot; and when we say global we usually mean \u0026quot;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;globally scoped statically allocated variable\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026quot;.

Nevertheless, the global var1 has static allocation. This is not intuitive! For this reason, I try to never use the word \u0026quot;static\u0026quot; when describing scope, and instead say something like \u0026quot;file\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;file limited\u0026quot; scope. However many people use the phrase \u0026quot;static\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;static scope\u0026quot; to describe a variable that can only be accessed from one code file. In the context of lifetime, \u0026quot;static\u0026quot; \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;always\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; means the variable is allocated at program start and deallocated when program exits.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Some people think of these concepts as C/C++ specific. They are not.

The heap grows when the memory allocator invokes the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;brk()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;sbrk()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; system call, mapping more pages of physical memory into the process\u0026apos;s virtual address space.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In systems without virtual memory, such as some embedded systems, the same basic layout often applies, except the stack and heap are fixed in size.

When it comes to object variables, these are merely references (pointers) to the actual objects on the heap.\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nEvery time an object is instantiated, a chunk of heap memory is set aside to hold the data (state) of that object. Since objects can contain other objects, some of this data can in fact hold references to those nested objects.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The stack is a portion of memory that can be manipulated via several key assembly language instructions, such as \u0026apos;pop\u0026apos; (remove and return a value from the stack) and \u0026apos;push\u0026apos; (push a value to the stack), but also call (call a subroutine - this pushes the address to return to the stack) and return (return from a subroutine - this pops the address off of the stack and jumps to it).  It\u0026apos;s the region of memory below the stack pointer register, which can be set as needed.  The stack is also used for passing arguments to subroutines, and also for preserving the values in registers before calling subroutines.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The heap is a portion of memory that is given to an application by the operating system, typically through a syscall like malloc.  On modern OSes this memory is a set of pages that only the calling process has access to.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The size of the stack is determined at runtime, and generally does not grow after the program launches.  In a C program, the stack needs to be large enough to hold every variable declared within each function.  The heap will grow dynamically as needed, but the OS is ultimately making the call (it will often grow the heap by more than the value requested by malloc, so that at least some future mallocs won\u0026apos;t need to go back to the kernel to get more memory.  This behavior is often customizable)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Because you\u0026apos;ve allocated the stack before launching the program, you never need to malloc before you can use the stack, so that\u0026apos;s a slight advantage there.  In practice, it\u0026apos;s very hard to predict what will be fast and what will be slow in modern operating systems that have virtual memory subsystems, because how the pages are implemented and where they are stored is an implementation detail.  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I think many other people have given you mostly correct answers on this matter.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;One detail that has been missed, however, is that the \u0026quot;heap\u0026quot; should in fact probably be called the \u0026quot;free store\u0026quot;.  The reason for this distinction is that the original free store was implemented with a data structure known as a \u0026quot;binomial heap.\u0026quot;  For that reason, allocating from early implementations of malloc()/free() was allocation from a heap.  However, in this modern day, most free stores are implemented with very elaborate data structures that are not binomial heaps.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You can do some interesting things with the stack.  For instance, you have functions like \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://everything2.com/title/alloca%2528%2529\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;alloca\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; (assuming you can get past the copious warnings concerning its use), which is a form of malloc that specifically uses the stack, not the heap, for memory.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;That said, stack-based memory errors are some of the worst I\u0026apos;ve experienced.  If you use heap memory, and you overstep the bounds of your allocated block, you have a decent chance of triggering a segment fault.  (Not 100%: your block may be incidentally contiguous with another that you have previously allocated.)  But since variables created on the stack are always contiguous with each other, writing out of bounds can change the value of another variable.  I have learned that whenever I feel that my program has stopped obeying the laws of logic, it is probably buffer overflow.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Simply, the stack is where local variables get created. Also, every time you call a subroutine the program counter (pointer to the next machine instruction) and any important registers, and sometimes the parameters get pushed on the stack. Then any local variables inside the subroutine are pushed onto the stack (and used from there). When the subroutine finishes, that stuff all gets popped back off the stack. The PC and register data gets and put back where it was as it is popped, so your program can go on its merry way.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The heap is the area of memory dynamic memory allocations are made out of (explicit \u0026quot;new\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;allocate\u0026quot; calls).

Every time a function declares a new variable, it is \u0026quot;pushed\u0026quot; onto the stack.

Once a stack variable is freed, that region of memory becomes available for other stack variables.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The advantage of using the stack to store variables, is that memory is managed for you. You don\u0026apos;t have to allocate memory by hand, or free it once you don\u0026apos;t need it any more.

It is a more free-floating region of memory (and is larger). To allocate memory on the heap, you must use malloc() or calloc(), which are built-in C functions. Once you have allocated memory on the heap, you are responsible for using free() to deallocate that memory once you don\u0026apos;t need it any more.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If you fail to do this, your program will have what is known as a memory leak. That is, memory on the heap will still be set aside (and won\u0026apos;t be available to other processes). As we will see in the debugging section, there is a tool called \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valgrind\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Valgrind\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; that can help you detect memory leaks.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Unlike the stack, the heap does not have size restrictions on variable size (apart from the obvious physical limitations of your computer). Heap memory is slightly slower to be read from and written to, because one has to use pointers to access memory on the heap. We will talk about pointers shortly.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Unlike the stack, variables created on the heap are accessible by any function, anywhere in your program.

When a function or a method calls another function which in turns calls another function, etc., the execution of all those functions remains suspended until the very last function returns its value. The stack is always reserved in a LIFO order, the most recently reserved block is always the next block to be freed. This makes it really simple to keep track of the stack, freeing a block from the stack is nothing more than adjusting one pointer.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Variables allocated on the heap have their memory allocated at run time and accessing this memory is a bit slower, but the heap size is only limited by the size of virtual memory. Elements of the heap have no dependencies with each other and can always be accessed randomly at any time. You can allocate a block at any time and free it at any time. This makes it much more complex to keep track of which parts of the heap are allocated or free at any given time.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/KdBPf.png\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/KdBPf.png\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;Enter image description here\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You can use the stack if you know exactly how much data you need to allocate before compile time, and it is not too big.

The trick then is to overlap enough of the code area that you can hook into the code. It\u0026apos;s a little tricky to do and you risk a program crash, but it\u0026apos;s easy and very effective.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The public heap resides in it\u0026apos;s own memory space outside of your program image space.

As far as possible, use the C++ standard library (STL) containers \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;vector\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;map\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;, and \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;list\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; as they are memory and speed efficient and added to make your life easier (you don\u0026apos;t need to worry about memory allocation/deallocation).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;After getting your code to run, if you find it is running unacceptably slow, then go back and refactor your code and see if it can be programmed more efficiently. It may turn out the problem has nothing to do with the stack or heap directly at all (e.g. use an iterative algorithm instead of a recursive one, look at I/O vs. CPU-bound tasks, perhaps add multithreading or multiprocessing).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I say \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;sometimes\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; slower/faster above because the speed of the program might not have anything to do with items being allocated on the stack or heap.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;To what extent are they controlled by the OS or language run-time?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;ANSWER:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;The stack size is determined at compile time by the compiler.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;The heap size varies during runtime.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; (\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;The heap works with the OS during runtime to allocate memory.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;ASIDE:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Below is a little more about control and compile-time vs. runtime operations.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Each computer has a unique \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;instruction set architecture (ISA)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;, which are its hardware commands (e.g. \u0026quot;MOVE\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;JUMP\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;ADD\u0026quot;, etc.).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;An OS is nothing more than a resource manager (controls how/when/ and where to use memory, processors, devices, and information).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The ISA of the OS is called the \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;bare machine\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; and the remaining commands are called the \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;extended machine\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;.

All CPUs have stack registers since the beginning and they had been always here, way of talking, as I know.
