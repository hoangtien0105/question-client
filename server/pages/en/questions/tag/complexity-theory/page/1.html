note, my answer is almost certainly confusing \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Big Oh notation\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; (which is an upper bound) with Big Theta notation \u0026quot;Î˜\u0026quot; (which is a two-side bound). But in my experience, this is actually typical of discussions in non-academic settings. Apologies for any confusion caused.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;BigOh complexity can be visualized with this graph:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/WcBRI.png\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=\u0026quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/WcBRI.png\u0026quot; alt=\u0026quot;Big Oh Analysis\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The simplest definition I can give for Big Oh notation is this:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Big Oh notation is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;There are some important and deliberately chosen words in that sentence:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;relative:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; you can only compare apples to apples.  You can\u0026apos;t compare an algorithm that does arithmetic multiplication to an algorithm that sorts a list of integers.  But a comparison of two algorithms to do arithmetic operations (one multiplication, one addition) will tell you something meaningful;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;representation:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; BigOh (in its simplest form) reduces the comparison between algorithms to a single variable.  That variable is chosen based on observations or assumptions.  For example, sorting algorithms are typically compared based on comparison operations (comparing two nodes to determine their relative ordering).  This assumes that comparison is expensive.  But what if the comparison is cheap but swapping is expensive?  It changes the comparison; and\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;complexity:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; if it takes me one second to sort 10,000 elements, how long will it take me to sort one million?  Complexity in this instance is a relative measure to something else.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Come back and reread the above when you\u0026apos;ve read the rest.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The best example of BigOh I can think of is doing arithmetic.  Take two numbers (123456 and 789012).  The basic arithmetic operations we learned in school were:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;addition;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;subtraction;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;multiplication; and\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;division.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Each of these is an operation or a problem.  A method of solving these is called an \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;algorithm\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The addition is the simplest.  You line the numbers up (to the right) and add the digits in a column writing the last number of that addition in the result.  The \u0026apos;tens\u0026apos; part of that number is carried over to the next column.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Let\u0026apos;s assume that the addition of these numbers is the most expensive operation in this algorithm. It stands to reason that to add these two numbers together we have to add together 6 digits (and possibly carry a 7th). If we add two 100 digit numbers together we have to do 100 additions.  If we add \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;two\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; 10,000 digit numbers we have to do 10,000 additions.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;See the pattern?  The \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;complexity\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; (being the number of operations) is directly proportional to the number of digits \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;n\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; in the larger number.  We call this \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;O(n)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;linear complexity\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Subtraction is similar (except you may need to borrow instead of carry).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Multiplication is different. You line the numbers up, take the first digit in the bottom number and multiply it in turn against each digit in the top number and so on through each digit. So to multiply our two 6 digit numbers we must do 36 multiplications. We may need to do as many as 10 or 11 column adds to get the end result too.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If we have two 100-digit numbers we need to do 10,000 multiplications and 200 adds.  For two one million digit numbers we need to do one trillion (10\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;12\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt;) multiplications and two million adds.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;As the algorithm scales with n-\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;squared\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;, this is \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;O(n\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;2\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt;)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;quadratic complexity\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;. This is a good time to introduce another important concept:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;We only care about the most significant portion of complexity.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The astute may have realized that we could express the number of operations as: n\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;2\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt; + 2n.  But as you saw from our example with two numbers of a million digits apiece, the second term (2n) becomes insignificant (accounting for 0.0002% of the total operations by that stage).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;One can notice that we\u0026apos;ve assumed the worst case scenario here. While multiplying 6 digit numbers, if one of them has 4 digits and the other one has 6 digits, then we only have 24 multiplications. Still, we calculate the worst case scenario for that \u0026apos;n\u0026apos;, i.e when both are 6 digit numbers. Hence Big Oh notation is about the Worst-case scenario of an algorithm.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;The Telephone Book\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The next best example I can think of is the telephone book, normally called the White Pages or similar but it varies from country to country.  But I\u0026apos;m talking about the one that lists people by surname and then initials or first name, possibly address and then telephone numbers.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now if you were instructing a computer to look up the phone number for \u0026quot;John Smith\u0026quot; in a telephone book that contains 1,000,000 names, what would you do?  Ignoring the fact that you could guess how far in the S\u0026apos;s started (let\u0026apos;s assume you can\u0026apos;t), what would you do?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A typical implementation might be to open up to the middle, take the 500,000\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;th\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt; and compare it to \u0026quot;Smith\u0026quot;. If it happens to be \u0026quot;Smith, John\u0026quot;, we just got really lucky.  Far more likely is that \u0026quot;John Smith\u0026quot; will be before or after that name.  If it\u0026apos;s after we then divide the last half of the phone book in half and repeat.  If it\u0026apos;s before then we divide the first half of the phone book in half and repeat.  And so on.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This is called a \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;binary search\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; and is used every day in programming whether you realize it or not.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So if you want to find a name in a phone book of a million names you can actually find any name by doing this at most 20 times.  In comparing search algorithms we decide that this comparison is our \u0026apos;n\u0026apos;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;For a phone book of 3 names it takes 2 comparisons (at most).\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;For 7 it takes at most 3.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;For 15 it takes 4.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;For 1,000,000 it takes 20.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;That is staggeringly good, isn\u0026apos;t it?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In BigOh terms this is \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;O(log n)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;logarithmic complexity\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;.

We usually don\u0026apos;t care too much unless the factor is very large since optimizing is tricky business ( \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/385506/when-is-optimisation-premature\u0026quot;\u0026gt;When is optimisation premature?\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; ); also the mere act of picking an algorithm with a better big-O will often improve performance by orders of magnitude.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Some asymptotically superior algorithms (e.g. a non-comparison \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(N log(log(N)))\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; sort) can have so large a constant factor (e.g. \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;100000*N log(log(N))\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;), or overhead that is relatively large like \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(N log(log(N)))\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; with a hidden \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;+ 100*N\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, that they are rarely worth using even on \u0026quot;big data\u0026quot;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Why O(N) is sometimes the best you can do, i.e. why we need datastructures\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(N)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; algorithms are in some sense the \u0026quot;best\u0026quot; algorithms if you need to read all your data. The \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;very act of reading\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; a bunch of data is an \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(N)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; operation. Loading it into memory is usually \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(N)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; (or faster if you have hardware support, or no time at all if you\u0026apos;ve already read the data). However, if you touch or even \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;look\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; at every piece of data (or even every other piece of data), your algorithm will take \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(N)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; time to perform this looking. No matter how long your actual algorithm takes, it will be at least \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(N)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; because it spent that time looking at all the data.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The same can be said for the \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;very act of writing\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;. All algorithms which print out N things will take N time because the output is at least that long (e.g. printing out all permutations (ways to rearrange) a set of N playing cards is factorial: \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(N!)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; (which is why in those cases, good programs will ensure an iteration uses O(1) memory and doesn\u0026apos;t print or store every intermediate step)).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This motivates the use of \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;data structures\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;: a data structure requires reading the data only once (usually \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(N)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; time), plus some arbitrary amount of preprocessing (e.g. \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(N)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(N log(N))\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(NÂ²)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;) which we try to keep small. Thereafter, modifying the data structure (insertions/deletions/ etc.) and making queries on the data take very little time, such as \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(1)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(log(N))\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. You then proceed to make a large number of queries! In general, the more work you\u0026apos;re willing to do ahead of time, the less work you\u0026apos;ll have to do later on.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;For example, say you had the latitude and longitude coordinates of millions of road segments and wanted to find all street intersections.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Naive method: If you had the coordinates of a street intersection, and wanted to examine nearby streets, you would have to go through the millions of segments each time, and check each one for adjacency.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;If you only needed to do this once, it would not be a problem to have to do the naive method of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(N)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; work only once, but if you want to do it many times (in this case, \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;N\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; times, once for each segment), we\u0026apos;d have to do \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(NÂ²)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; work, or 1000000Â²=1000000000000 operations.

Thereafter, it only takes constant time on average to look up something by its key (in this case, our key is the latitude and longitude coordinates, rounded into a grid; we search the adjacent gridspaces of which there are only 9, which is a constant).\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Our task went from an infeasible \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(NÂ²)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to a manageable \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(N)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, and all we had to do was pay a minor cost to make a hash table.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;analogy\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;: The analogy in this particular case is a jigsaw puzzle: We created a data structure that exploits some property of the data. If our road segments are like puzzle pieces, we group them by matching color and pattern. We then exploit this to avoid doing extra work later (comparing puzzle pieces of like color to each other, not to every other single puzzle piece).\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The moral of the story: a data structure lets us speed up operations. Even more, advanced data structures can let you combine, delay, or even ignore operations in incredibly clever ways. Different problems would have different analogies, but they\u0026apos;d all involve organizing the data in a way that exploits some structure we care about, or which we\u0026apos;ve artificially imposed on it for bookkeeping. We do work ahead of time (basically planning and organizing), and now repeated tasks are much much easier!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;hr\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Practical example: visualizing orders of growth while coding\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Asymptotic notation is, at its core, quite separate from programming.

Why do I say \u0026quot;a multiplicative factor\u0026quot;?--because loops and functions (almost by definition) have multiplicative running time: the number of iterations, times work done in the loop (or for functions: the number of times you call the function, times work done in the function).

You can drastically speed up some algorithms by using caching, making them cache-oblivious, avoiding bottlenecks by working with RAM instead of disk, using parallelization, or doing work ahead of time -- these techniques are often \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;independent\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; of the order-of-growth \u0026quot;big-O\u0026quot; notation, though you will often see the number of cores in the big-O notation of parallel algorithms.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Also keep in mind that due to hidden constraints of your program, you might not really care about asymptotic behavior. You may be working with a bounded number of values, for example:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;If you\u0026apos;re sorting something like 5 elements, you don\u0026apos;t want to use the speedy \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(N log(N))\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; quicksort; you want to use insertion sort, which happens to perform well on small inputs. These situations often come up in divide-and-conquer algorithms, where you split up the problem into smaller and smaller subproblems, such as recursive sorting, fast Fourier transforms, or matrix multiplication.\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;If some values are effectively bounded due to some hidden fact (e.g. the average human name is softly bounded at perhaps 40 letters, and human age is softly bounded at around 150).

We don\u0026apos;t really consider this as part of the resource bounds, because we think of the scaling in terms of machine resources (e.g. per clock cycle), not per real second. However, there are similar things which can \u0026apos;secretly\u0026apos; affect performance, such as whether you are running under emulation, or whether the compiler optimized code or not. These might make some basic operations take longer (even relative to each other), or even speed up or slow down some operations asymptotically (even relative to each other). The effect may be small or large between different implementation and/or environment. Do you switch languages or machines to eke out that little extra work? That depends on a hundred other reasons (necessity, skills, coworkers, programmer productivity, the monetary value of your time, familiarity, workarounds, why not assembly or GPU, etc...), which may be more important than performance.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The above issues, like the effect of the choice of which programming language is used, are almost never considered as part of the constant factor (nor should they be); yet one should be aware of them because \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;sometimes\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; (though rarely) they may affect things. For example in cpython, the native priority queue implementation is asymptotically non-optimal (\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(log(N))\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; rather than \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(1)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; for your choice of insertion or find-min); do you use another implementation? Probably not, since the C implementation is probably faster, and there are probably other similar issues elsewhere.

Imaging you want to search for an Item in an Array. You would have to look on Each element and as \u0026quot;Are you the correct element/item?\u0026quot; in the worst case, the item is at the last index, which means that it took as much time as there are items in the list, so to be generic, we say \u0026quot;oh hey, n is a fair given amount of values!\u0026quot;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So then you might understand what \u0026quot;n\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;2\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt;\u0026quot; means, but to be even more specific, play with the thought you have a simple, the simpliest of the sorting algorithms; bubblesort.

For each item, you look at all items once more, for comparing, this is also \u0026quot;n\u0026quot;, so for every item, you look \u0026quot;n\u0026quot; times meaning n*n = n\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;2\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I hope this is as simple as you want it.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;But remember, Big O is just a way to experss yourself in the manner of time and space.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Big O describes the fundamental scaling nature of an algorithm.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;There is a lot of information that Big O does not tell you about a given algorithm. It cuts to the bone and gives only information about the scaling nature of an algorithm, specifically how the resource use (think time or memory) of an algorithm scales in response to the \u0026quot;input size\u0026quot;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Consider the difference between a steam engine and a rocket. They are not merely different varieties of the same thing (as, say, a Prius engine vs. a Lamborghini engine) but they are dramatically different kinds of propulsion systems, at their core. A steam engine may be faster than a toy rocket, but no steam piston engine will be able to achieve the speeds of an orbital launch vehicle. This is because these systems have different scaling characteristics with regards to the relation of fuel required (\u0026quot;resource usage\u0026quot;) to reach a given speed (\u0026quot;input size\u0026quot;).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Why is this so important? Because software deals with problems that may differ in size by factors up to a trillion. Consider that for a moment. The ratio between the speed necessary to travel to the Moon and human walking speed is less than 10,000:1, and that is absolutely tiny compared to the range in input sizes software may face. And because software may face an astronomical range in input sizes there is the potential for the Big O complexity of an algorithm, it\u0026apos;s fundamental scaling nature, to trump any implementation details.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Consider the canonical sorting example. Bubble-sort is O(n\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;2\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt;) while merge-sort is O(n log n). Let\u0026apos;s say you have two sorting applications, application A which uses bubble-sort and application B which uses merge-sort, and let\u0026apos;s say that for input sizes of around 30 elements application A is 1,000x faster than application B at sorting. If you never have to sort much more than 30 elements then it\u0026apos;s obvious that you should prefer application A, as it is much faster at these input sizes. However, if you find that you may have to sort ten million items then what you\u0026apos;d expect is that application B actually ends up being thousands of times faster than application A in this case, entirely due to the way each algorithm scales.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Here is the plain English bestiary I tend to use when explaining the common varieties of Big-O\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In all cases, prefer algorithms higher up on the list to those lower on the list.  However, the cost of moving to a more expensive complexity class varies significantly.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;O(1):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;No growth.  Regardless of how big as the problem is, you can solve it in the same amount of time.  This is somewhat analogous to broadcasting where it takes the same amount of energy to broadcast over a given distance, regardless of the number of people that lie within the broadcast range.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;O(log \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;n\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This complexity is the same as \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;O(1)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; except that it\u0026apos;s just a little bit worse.  For all practical purposes, you can consider this as a very large constant scaling.  The difference in work between processing 1 thousand and 1 billion items is only a factor six.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;O(\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;n\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The cost of solving the problem is proportional to the size of the problem.  If your problem doubles in size, then the cost of the solution doubles.  Since most problems have to be scanned into the computer in some way, as data entry, disk reads, or network traffic, this is generally an affordable scaling factor.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;O(\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;n\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; log \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;n\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This complexity is very similar to \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;O(\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;n\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;.  For all practical purposes, the two are equivalent.  This level of complexity would generally still be considered scalable.

For example, bounding the size of keys reduces sorting from \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;O(\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;n\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; log \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;n\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; to \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;O(\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;n\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;)\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;O(\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;n\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;2\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt;):\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Grows as a square, where \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;n\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; is the length of the side of a square.

So do I.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So to talk of big O, I will use words that have just one beat in them.  One sound per word.  Small words are quick.  You know these words, and so do I.  We will use words with one sound.  They are small.  I am sure you will know all of the words we will use!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now, lets you and me talk of work. Most of the time, I do not like work.  Do you like work?  It may be the case that you do, but I am sure I do not.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I do not like to go to work.  I do not like to spend time at work.  If I had my way, I would like just to play, and do fun things.  Do you feel the same as I do?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now at times, I do have to go to work.  It is sad, but true.  So, when I am at work, I have a rule: I try to do less work.  As near to no work as I can.  Then I go play!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So here is the big news: the big O can help me not to do work!  I can play more of the time, if I know big O.  Less work, more play!  That is what big O helps me do.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now I have some work.  I have this list: one, two, three, four, five, six.  I must add all things in this list.  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Wow, I hate work.  But oh well, I have to do this.  So here I go.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;One plus two is three plus three is six... and four is... I dont know.  I got lost.  It is too hard for me to do in my head.  I dont much care for this kind of work.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So let\u0026apos;s not do the work.  Let\u0026apos;s you and me just think how hard it is.  How much work would I have to do, to add six numbers?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Well, lets see.  I must add one and two, and then add that to three, and then add that to four All in all, I count six adds.  I have to do six adds to solve this.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Here comes big O, to tell us just how hard this math is.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Big O says: we must do six adds to solve this.  One add, for each thing from one to six.  Six small bits of work... each bit of work is one add.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Well, I will not do the work to add them now.  But I know how hard it would be.  It would be six adds.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Oh no, now I have more work.  Sheesh.  Who makes this kind of stuff?!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now they ask me to add from one to ten!  Why would I do that?  I did not want to add one to six.  To add from one to ten well that would be even more hard!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;How much more hard would it be?  How much more work would I have to do?  Do I need more or less steps?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Well, I guess I would have to do ten adds one for each thing from one to ten.  Ten is more than six.  I would have to work that much more to add from one to ten, than one to six!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I do not want to add right now.  I just want to think on how hard it might be to add that much.  And, I hope, to play as soon as I can.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;To add from one to six, that is some work.  But do you see, to add from one to ten, that is more work?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Big O is your friend and mine.  Big O helps us think on how much work we have to do, so we can plan.  And, if we are friends with big O, he can help us choose work that is not so hard!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now we must do new work.  Oh, no.  I dont like this work thing at all.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The new work is: add all things from one to n.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Wait!  What is n?  Did I miss that?  How can I add from one to n if you dont tell me what n is?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Well, I dont know what n is.  I was not told.  Were you?  No?   Oh well.  So we cant do the work.  Whew.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;But though we will not do the work now, we can guess how hard it would be, if we knew n.  We would have to add up n things, right?  Of course!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now here comes big O, and he will tell us how hard this work is.  He says: to add all things from one to N, one by one, is O(n).  To add all these things, [I know I must add n times.][1]  That is big O!  He tells us how hard it is to do some type of work.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;To me, I think of big O like a big, slow, boss man.  He thinks on work, but he does not do it.  He might say, \u0026quot;That work is quick.\u0026quot;  Or, he might say, \u0026quot;That work is so slow and hard!\u0026quot;  But he does not do the work.  He just looks at the work, and then he tells us how much time it might take.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I care lots for big O.  Why?  I do not like to work!  No one likes to work.  That is why we all love big O!  He tells us how fast we can work.  He helps us think of how hard work is.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Uh oh, more work.  Now, lets not do the work.  But, lets make a plan to do it, step by step.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;They gave us a deck of ten cards.  They are all mixed up: seven, four, two, six not straight at all.  And now... our job is to sort them.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Ergh.  That sounds like a lot of work!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;How can we sort this deck?  I have a plan.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I will look at each pair of cards, pair by pair, through the deck, from first to last.  If the first card in one pair is big and the next card in that pair is small, I swap them.  Else, I go to the next pair, and so on and so on... and soon, the deck is done.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When the deck is done, I ask: did I swap cards in that pass?  If so, I must do it all once more, from the top.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;At some point, at some time, there will be no swaps, and our sort of the deck would be done.  So much work!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Well, how much work would that be, to sort the cards with those rules?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I have ten cards.  And, most of the time -- that is, if I dont have lots of luck -- I must go through the whole deck up to ten times, with up to ten card swaps each time through the deck.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Big O, help me!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Big O comes in and says: for a deck of n cards, to sort it this way will be done in O(N squared) time.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Why does he say n squared?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Well, you know n squared is n times n.  Now, I get it: n cards checked, up to what might be n times through the deck.  That is two loops, each with n steps.  That is n squared much work to be done.  A lot of work, for sure!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now when big O says it will take O(n squared) work, he does not mean n squared adds, on the nose.  It might be some small bit less, for some case.  But in the worst case, it will be near n squared steps of work to sort the deck.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now here is where big O is our friend.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Big O points out this: as n gets big, when we sort cards, the job gets MUCH MUCH MORE HARD than the old just-add-these-things job.  How do we know this?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Well, if n gets real big, we do not care what we might add to n or n squared.  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;For big n, n squared is more large than n.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Big O tells us that to sort things is more hard than to add things.  O(n squared) is more than O(n) for big n.  That means: if n gets real big, to sort a mixed deck of n things MUST take more time, than to just add n mixed things.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Big O does not solve the work for us.  Big O tells us how hard the work is.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I have a deck of cards.  I did sort them.  You helped.  Thanks.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Is there a more fast way to sort the cards?  Can big O help us?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Yes, there is a more fast way!  It takes some time to learn, but it works... and it works quite fast.  You can try it too, but take your time with each step and do not lose your place.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In this new way to sort a deck, we do not check pairs of cards the way we did a while ago.  Here are your new rules to sort this deck:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;One: I choose one card in the part of the deck we work on now.  You can choose one for me if you like.  (The first time we do this, the part of the deck we work on now is the whole deck, of course.)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Two: I splay the deck on that card you chose.  What is this splay; how do I splay?  Well, I go from the start card down, one by one, and I look for a card that is more high than the splay card.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Three: I go from the end card up, and I look for a card that is more low than the splay card.  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Once I have found these two cards, I swap them, and go on to look for more cards to swap.  That is, I go back to step Two, and splay on the card you chose some more.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;At some point, this loop (from Two to Three) will end.  It ends when both halves of this search meet at the splay card.  Then, we have just splayed the deck with the card you chose in step One.  Now, all the cards near the start are more low than the splay card; and the cards near the end are more high than the splay card.  Cool trick!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Four (and this is the fun part): I have two small decks now, one more low than the splay card, and one more high.  Now I go to step one, on each small deck!  That is to say, I start from step One on the first small deck, and when that work is done, I start from step One on the next small deck.  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I break up the deck in parts, and sort each part, more small and more small, and at some time I have no more work to do.  Now this may seem slow, with all the rules.  But trust me, it is not slow at all.  It is much less work than the first way to sort things!\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;What is this sort called?  It is called Quick Sort!  That sort was made by a man called \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare\u0026quot;\u0026gt;C. A. R. Hoare\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; and he called it Quick Sort.

This removes all constant factors so that the running time can be estimated in relation to N as N approaches infinity. In general you can think of it like this:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;statement;\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Is constant. The running time of the statement will not change in relation to N\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;for ( i = 0; i \u0026amp;lt; N; i++ )\n  statement;\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Is linear. The running time of the loop is directly proportional to N. When N doubles, so does the running time.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;for ( i = 0; i \u0026amp;lt; N; i++ ) \n{\nfor ( j = 0; j \u0026amp;lt; N; j++ )\n  statement;\n}\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Is quadratic. The running time of the two loops is proportional to the square of N. When N doubles, the running time increases by N * N.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;while ( low \u0026amp;lt;= high ) \n{\n mid = ( low + high ) / 2;\n if ( target \u0026amp;lt; list[mid] )\n high = mid - 1;\n else if ( target \u0026amp;gt; list[mid] )\n  low = mid + 1;\nelse break;\n}\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Is logarithmic. The running time of the algorithm is proportional to the number of times N can be divided by 2. This is because the algorithm divides the working area in half with each iteration.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;void quicksort ( int list[], int left, int right )\n{\n  int pivot = partition ( list, left, right );\n  quicksort ( list, left, pivot - 1 );\n  quicksort ( list, pivot + 1, right );\n}\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Is N * log ( N ). The running time consists of N loops (iterative or recursive) that are logarithmic, thus the algorithm is a combination of linear and logarithmic.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In general, doing something with every item in one dimension is linear, doing something with every item in two dimensions is quadratic, and dividing the working area in half is logarithmic. There are other Big O measures such as cubic, exponential, and square root, but they\u0026apos;re not nearly as common. Big O notation is described as O (  ) where  is the measure. The quicksort algorithm would be described as O ( N * log ( N ) ).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Note: None of this has taken into account best, average, and worst case measures. Each would have its own Big O notation. Also note that this is a VERY simplistic explanation. Big O is the most common, but it\u0026apos;s also more complex that I\u0026apos;ve shown. There are also other notations such as big omega, little o, and big theta.

It works\n  by selecting the middle element of the data set, essentially the\n  median, and compares it against a target value. If the values match it\n  will return success. If the target value is higher than the value of\n  the probe element it will take the upper half of the data set and\n  perform the same operation against it. Likewise, if the target value\n  is lower than the value of the probe element it will perform the\n  operation against the lower half. It will continue to halve the data\n  set with each iteration until the value has been found or until it can\n  no longer split the data set.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n  \n  \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This type of algorithm is described as O(log N). The iterative halving\n  of data sets described in the binary search example produces a growth\n  curve that peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size\n  of the data sets increase e.g. an input data set containing 10 items\n  takes one second to complete, a data set containing 100 items takes\n  two seconds, and a data set containing 1000 items will take three\n  seconds. Doubling the size of the input data set has little effect on\n  its growth as after a single iteration of the algorithm the data set\n  will be halved and therefore on a par with an input data set half the\n  size. This makes algorithms like binary search extremely efficient\n  when dealing with large data sets.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This is a very simplified explanation, but I hope it covers most important details.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Let\u0026apos;s say your algorithm dealing with the problem depends on some \u0026apos;factors\u0026apos;, for example let\u0026apos;s make it N and X.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Depending on N and X, your algorithm will require some operations, for example in the WORST case it\u0026apos;s \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;3(N^2) + log(X)\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; operations.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Since Big-O doesn\u0026apos;t care too much about constant factor (aka 3), the Big-O of your algorithm is \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;O(N^2 + log(X))\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.
