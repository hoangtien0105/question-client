This is an example of a single shared resource that has to be managed.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;It\u0026apos;s rare that you need a singleton. The reason they\u0026apos;re bad is that they feel like a \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_variable\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;global\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; and they\u0026apos;re a fully paid up member of the GoF \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Design Patterns\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; book.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When you think you need a global, you\u0026apos;re probably making a terrible design mistake.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Some coding snobs look down on them as just a glorified global. In the same way that many people hate the \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;goto\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; statement there are others that hate the idea of ever using a \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;global\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;. I have seen several developers go to extraordinary lengths to avoid a \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;global\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; because they considered using one as an admission of failure. Strange but true.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In practice the \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;Singleton\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; pattern is just a programming technique that is a useful part of your toolkit of concepts. From time to time you might find it is the ideal solution and so use it. But using it just so you can boast about using a \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;design pattern\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; is just as stupid as refusing to ever use it because it is just a \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;global\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Misko Hevery, from Google, has some interesting articles on exactly this topic...\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://testing.googleblog.com/2008/08/by-miko-hevery-so-you-join-new-project.html\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Singletons are Pathological Liars\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; has a unit testing example that illustrates how singletons can make it difficult to figure out dependency chains and start or test an application. It is a fairly extreme example of abuse, but the point that he makes is still valid:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Singletons are nothing more than global state. Global state makes it so your objects can secretly get hold of things which are not declared in their APIs, and, as a result, Singletons make your APIs into pathological liars.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://testing.googleblog.com/2008/08/where-have-all-singletons-gone.html\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Where have all the Singletons Gone\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; makes the point that dependency injection has made it easy to get instances to constructors that require them, which alleviates the underlying need behind the bad, global Singletons decried in the first article.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I think the confusion is caused by the fact that people don\u0026apos;t know the real application of the Singleton pattern. I can\u0026apos;t stress this enough. Singleton is \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;not\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; a pattern to wrap globals. Singleton pattern should only be used to guarantee that \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;one and only one instance of a given class\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; exists during run time. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;People think Singleton is evil because they are using it for globals. It is because of this confusion that Singleton is looked down upon. Please, don\u0026apos;t confuse Singletons and globals. If used for the purpose it was intended for, you will gain extreme benefits from the Singleton pattern.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;One rather bad thing about singletons is that you can\u0026apos;t extend them very easily. You basically have to build in some kind of \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;decorator pattern\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; or some such thing if you want to change their behavior. Also, if one day you want to have multiple ways of doing that one thing, it can be rather painful to change, depending on how you lay out your code.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;One thing to note, if you DO use singletons, try to pass them in to whoever needs them rather than have them access it directly... Otherwise if you ever choose to have multiple ways of doing the thing that singleton does, it will be rather difficult to change as each class embeds a dependency if it accesses the singleton directly.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So basically:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-java s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-java\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;public\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;MyConstructor\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-params\u0026quot;\u0026gt;(Singleton singleton)\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;this\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;.singleton = singleton;\n}\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;rather than:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-java s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-java\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;public\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;MyConstructor\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-params\u0026quot;\u0026gt;()\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-built_in\u0026quot;\u0026gt;this\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;.singleton = Singleton.getInstance();\n}\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I believe this sort of pattern is called \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;dependency injection\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; and is generally considered a good thing.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Like any pattern though... Think about it and consider if its use in the given situation is inappropriate or not... Rules are made to be broken usually, and \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;patterns\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; should not be applied willy nilly without thought.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The singleton pattern is not a problem in itself. The problem is that the pattern is often used by people developing software with object-oriented tools without having a solid grasp of OO concepts. When singletons are introduced in this context they tend to grow into unmanageable classes that contain helper methods for every little use.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Singletons are also a problem from a testing perspective.

A defeat in monopoly is hard to swallow because, monopoly is about money, if you lose you have to painstakingly watch the rest of the players finish the game, and losses are usually swift and crushing. So, the rules usually get twisted at some point to serve the self-interest of some of the players at the expense of the others.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So you\u0026apos;re playing monopoly with friends Bob, Joe, and Ed. You\u0026apos;re swiftly building your empire and consuming market share at an exponential rate. Your opponents are weakening and you start to smell blood (figuratively). Your buddy Bob put all of his money into gridlocking as many low-value properties as possible but his isn\u0026apos;t receiving a high return on investment the way he expected. Bob, as a stroke of bad luck, lands on your Boardwalk and is excised from the game.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now the game goes from friendly dice-rolling to serious business. Bob has been made the example of failure and Joe and Ed don\u0026apos;t want to end up like \u0026apos;that guy\u0026apos;. So, being the leading player you, all of a sudden, become the enemy. Joe and Ed start practicing under-the-table trades, behind-the-back money injections, undervalued house-swapping and generally anything to weaken you as a player until one of them rises to the top. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Then, instead of one of them winning, the process starts all over. All of a sudden, a finite set of rules becomes a moving target and the game degenerates into the type of social interactions that would make up the foundation of every high-rated reality TV show since Survivor. Why, because the rules are changing and there\u0026apos;s no consensus on how/why/what they\u0026apos;re supposed to represent, and more importantly, there\u0026apos;s no one person making the decisions. Every player in the game, at that point, is making his/her own rules and chaos ensues until two of the players are too tired to keep up the charade and slowly give up.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So, if a rulebook for a game accurately represented a singleton, the monopoly rulebook would be an example of abuse. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;How does this apply to programming?\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Aside from all of the obvious thread-safety and synchronization issues that mutable singletons present... If you have one set of data, that is capable of being read/manipulated by multiple different sources concurrently and exists during the lifetime of the application execution, it\u0026apos;s probably a good time to step back and ask \u0026quot;am I using the right type of data structure here\u0026quot;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Personally, I have seen a programmer abuse a singleton by using it as some sort of twisted cross-thread database store within an application. Having worked on the code directly, I can attest that it was a slow (because of all the thread locks needed to make it thread-safe) and a nightmare to work on (because of the unpredictable/intermittent nature of synchronization bugs), and nearly impossible to test under \u0026apos;production\u0026apos; conditions. Sure, a system could have been developed using polling/signaling to overcome some of the performance issues but that wouldn\u0026apos;t solve the issues with testing and, why bother when a \u0026apos;real\u0026apos; database can already accomplish the same functionality in a much more robust/scalable manner.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;A Singleton is \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;only\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; an option if you need what a singleton provides.

Many of the foundational components of languages are singletons (classes, functions, namespaces and even operators), as are components in other aspects of computing (localhost, default route, virtual filesystem, etc.), and it is not by accident. While they cause trouble and frustration from time to time, they also can make a lot of things work a LOT better.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The two biggest screw ups I see are: treating it like a global \u0026amp;amp; failing to define the Singleton closure.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Everyone talks about Singleton\u0026apos;s as globals, because they basically are. However, much (sadly, not all) of the badness in a global comes not intrinsically from being global, but how you use it. Same goes for Singletons. Actually more so as \u0026quot;single instance\u0026quot; really doesn\u0026apos;t need to mean \u0026quot;globally accessible\u0026quot;. It is more a natural byproduct, and given all the bad that we know comes from it, we shouldn\u0026apos;t be in such a hurry to exploit global accessibility. Once programmers see a Singleton they seem to always access it directly through its instance method. Instead, you should navigate to it just like you would any other object. Most code shouldn\u0026apos;t even be aware it is dealing with a Singleton (loose coupling, right?). If only a small bit of code accesses the object like it is a global, a lot of harm is undone. I recommend enforcing it by restricting access to the instance function.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The Singleton context is also really important. The defining characteristic of a Singleton is that there is \u0026quot;only one\u0026quot;, but the truth is it is \u0026quot;only one\u0026quot; within some kind of context/namespace. They are usually one of: one per thread, process, IP address or cluster, but can also be one per processor, machine, language namespace/class loader/whatever, subnet, Internet, etc.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The other, less common, mistake is to ignore the Singleton lifestyle. Just because there is only one doesn\u0026apos;t mean a Singleton is some omnipotent \u0026quot;always was and always will be\u0026quot;, nor is it generally desirable (objects without a begin and end violate all kinds of useful assumptions in code, and should be employed only in the most desperate of circumstances.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If you avoid those mistakes, Singletons can still be a PITA, bit it is ready to see a lot of the worst problems are significantly mitigated. Imagine a Java Singleton, that is explicitly defined as once per classloader (which means it needs a thread safety policy), with defined creation and destruction methods and a life cycle that dictates when and how they get invoked, and whose \u0026quot;instance\u0026quot; method has package protection so it is generally accessed through other, non-global objects. Still a potential source of trouble, but certainly much less trouble.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Sadly, rather than teaching good examples of how to do Singletons.
