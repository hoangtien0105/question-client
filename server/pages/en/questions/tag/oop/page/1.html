are some wonderful answers on here to this questions that get into all sorts of great detail about interfaces and loosely coupling code, inversion of control and so on.  There are some fairly heady discussions, so I\u0026apos;d like to take the opportunity to break things down a bit for understanding why an interface is useful.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When I first started getting exposed to interfaces, I too was confused about their relevance.  I didn\u0026apos;t understand why you needed them.  If we\u0026apos;re using a language like Java or C#, we already have inheritance and I viewed interfaces as a \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;weaker\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; form of inheritance and thought, \u0026quot;why bother?\u0026quot;  In a sense I was right, you can think of interfaces as sort of a weak form of inheritance, but beyond that I finally understood their use as a language construct by thinking of them as a means of classifying common traits or behaviors that were exhibited by potentially many non-related classes of objects.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;For example -- say you have a SIM game and have the following classes:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-java s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-java\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;class\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title class_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;HouseFly\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; inherits Insect {\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;void\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;FlyAroundYourHead\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-params\u0026quot;\u0026gt;()\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{}\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;void\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;LandOnThings\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-params\u0026quot;\u0026gt;()\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{}\n}\n\n\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;class\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title class_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Telemarketer\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; inherits Person {\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;void\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;CallDuringDinner\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-params\u0026quot;\u0026gt;()\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{}\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;void\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;ContinueTalkingWhenYouSayNo\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-params\u0026quot;\u0026gt;()\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{}\n}\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Clearly, these two objects have nothing in common in terms of direct inheritance.  But, you could say they are both annoying.  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Let\u0026apos;s say our game needs to have some sort of random \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;thing\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; that annoys the game player when they eat dinner.  This could be a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;HouseFly\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; or a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Telemarketer\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; or both -- but how do you allow for both with a single function?  And how do you ask each different type of object to \u0026quot;do their annoying thing\u0026quot; in the same way?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The key to realize is that both a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Telemarketer\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;HouseFly\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; share a common loosely interpreted behavior even though they are nothing alike in terms of modeling them.  So, let\u0026apos;s make an interface that both can implement:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-java s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-java\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;interface\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title class_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;IPest\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;void\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;BeAnnoying\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-params\u0026quot;\u0026gt;()\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;;\n}\n\n\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;class\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title class_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;HouseFly\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; inherits Insect \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;implements\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title class_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;IPest\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;void\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;FlyAroundYourHead\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-params\u0026quot;\u0026gt;()\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{}\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;void\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;LandOnThings\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-params\u0026quot;\u0026gt;()\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{}\n\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;void\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;BeAnnoying\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-params\u0026quot;\u0026gt;()\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {\n        FlyAroundYourHead();\n        LandOnThings();\n    }\n}\n\n\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;class\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title class_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Telemarketer\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; inherits Person \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;implements\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title class_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;IPest\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;void\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;CallDuringDinner\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-params\u0026quot;\u0026gt;()\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{}\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;void\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;ContinueTalkingWhenYouSayNo\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-params\u0026quot;\u0026gt;()\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{}\n\n    \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;void\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-title function_\u0026quot;\u0026gt;BeAnnoying\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-params\u0026quot;\u0026gt;()\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {\n        CallDuringDinner();\n        ContinueTalkingWhenYouSayNo();\n    }\n}\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We now have two classes that can each be annoying in their own way.

This means that in our little world, a member of the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;pests\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; array could actually be a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Telemarketer\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; object or a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;HouseFly\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; object.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ServeDinner\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; method is called when dinner is served and our people in the dining room are supposed to eat.  In our little game, that\u0026apos;s when our pests do their work -- each pest is instructed to be annoying by way of the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;IPest\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; interface.  In this way, we can easily have both \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Telemarketers\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;HouseFlys\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; be annoying in each of their own ways -- we care only that we have something in the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;DiningRoom\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; object that is a pest, we don\u0026apos;t really care what it is and they could have nothing in common with other.  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This very contrived pseudo-code example (that dragged on a lot longer than I anticipated) is simply meant to illustrate the kind of thing that finally turned the light on for me in terms of when we might use an interface.  I apologize in advance for the silliness of the example, but hope that it helps in your understanding.  And, to be sure, the other posted answers you\u0026apos;ve received here really cover the gamut of the use of interfaces today in design patterns and development methodologies.  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The specific example I used to give to students is that they should write\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;List myList = new ArrayList(); // programming to the List interface\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;instead of\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ArrayList myList = new ArrayList(); // this is bad\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;These look exactly the same in a short program, but if you go on to use \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;myList\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; 100 times in your program you can start to see a difference.  The first declaration ensures that you only call methods on \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;myList\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; that are defined by the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;List\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; interface (so no \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ArrayList\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; specific methods).  If you\u0026apos;ve programmed to the interface this way, later on you can decide that you really need\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;List myList = new TreeList();\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;and you only have to change your code in that one spot.  You already know that the rest of your code doesn\u0026apos;t do anything that will be broken by changing the \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;implementation\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; because you programmed to the \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;interface\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The benefits are even more obvious (I think) when you\u0026apos;re talking about method parameters and return values.  Take this for example:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;public ArrayList doSomething(HashMap map);\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;That method declaration ties you to two concrete implementations (\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ArrayList\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;HashMap\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;). As soon as that method is called from other code, any changes to those types probably mean you\u0026apos;re going to have to change the calling code as well. It would be better to program to the interfaces.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;public List doSomething(Map map);\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now it doesn\u0026apos;t matter what kind of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;List\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; you return, or what kind of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Map\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is passed in as a parameter. Changes that you make inside the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;doSomething\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; method won\u0026apos;t force you to change the calling code.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Programming to an interface is saying, \u0026quot;I need this functionality and I don\u0026apos;t care where it comes from.\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Consider (in Java), the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;List\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; interface versus the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ArrayList\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;LinkedList\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; concrete classes. If all I care about is that I have a data structure containing multiple data items that I should access via iteration, I\u0026apos;d pick a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;List\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; (and that\u0026apos;s 99% of the time). If I know that I need constant-time insert/delete from either end of the list, I might pick the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;LinkedList\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; concrete implementation (or more likely, use the \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/queue.html\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Queue\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; interface). If I know I need random access by index, I\u0026apos;d pick the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ArrayList\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; concrete class.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Programming to an interface has absolutely nothing to do with abstract interfaces like we see in Java or .NET. It isn\u0026apos;t even an OOP concept.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;What it means is don\u0026apos;t go messing around with the internals of an object or data structure. Use the Abstract Program Interface, or API, to interact with your data. In Java or C# that means using public properties and methods instead of raw field access. For C that means using functions instead of raw pointers.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;EDIT:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; And with databases it means using views and stored procedures instead of direct table access.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Using interfaces is a key factor in making your code easily testable in addition to removing unnecessary couplings between your classes.  By creating an interface that defines the operations on your class, you allow classes that want to use that functionality the ability to use it without depending on your implementing class directly.  If later on you decide to change and use a different implementation, you need only change the part of the code where the implementation is instantiated.  The rest of the code need not change because it depends on the interface, not the implementing class.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This is very useful in creating unit tests.  In the class under test you have it depend on the interface and inject an instance of the interface into the class (or a factory that allows it to build instances of the interface as needed) via the constructor or a property settor.  The class uses the provided (or created) interface in its methods.  When you go to write your tests, you can mock or fake the interface and provide an interface that responds with data configured in your unit test.  You can do this because your class under test deals only with the interface, not your concrete implementation.  Any class implementing the interface, including your mock or fake class, will do.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;EDIT:\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; Below is a link to an article where Erich Gamma discusses his quote, \u0026quot;Program to an interface, not an implementation.\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://www.artima.com/lejava/articles/designprinciples.html\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;http://www.artima.com/lejava/articles/designprinciples.html\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You should look into Inversion of Control:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;nofollow noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Martin Fowler: Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection pattern\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_Control\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;nofollow noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Wikipedia: Inversion of Control\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In such a scenario, you wouldn\u0026apos;t write this:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;IInterface classRef = new ObjectWhatever();\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You would write something like this:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;IInterface classRef = container.Resolve\u0026amp;lt;IInterface\u0026amp;gt;();\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This would go into a rule-based setup in the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;container\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; object, and construct the actual object for you, which could be ObjectWhatever. The important thing is that you could replace this rule with something that used another type of object altogether, and your code would still work.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If we leave IoC off the table, you can write code that knows that it can talk to an object \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;that does something specific\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;, but not which type of object or how it does it.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This would come in handy when passing parameters.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;As for your parenthesized question \u0026quot;Also, how could you write a method that takes in an object that implements an Interface? Is that possible?\u0026quot;, in C# you would simply use the interface type for the parameter type, like this:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;public void DoSomethingToAnObject(IInterface whatever) { ... }\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This plugs right into the \u0026quot;talk to an object that does something specific.\u0026quot; The method defined above knows what to expect from the object, that it implements everything in IInterface, but it doesn\u0026apos;t care which type of object it is, only that it adheres to the contract, which is what an interface is.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;For instance, you\u0026apos;re probably familiar with calculators and have probably used quite a few in your days, but most of the time they\u0026apos;re all different. You, on the other hand, knows how a standard calculator should work, so you\u0026apos;re able to use them all, even if you can\u0026apos;t use the specific features that each calculator has that none of the other has.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This is the beauty of interfaces. You can write a piece of code, that knows that it will get objects passed to it that it can expect certain behavior from. It doesn\u0026apos;t care one hoot what kind of object it is, only that it supports the behavior needed.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Let me give you a concrete example.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We have a custom-built translation system for windows forms. This system loops through controls on a form and translate text in each. The system knows how to handle basic controls, like the-type-of-control-that-has-a-Text-property, and similar basic stuff, but for anything basic, it falls short.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Now, since controls inherit from pre-defined classes that we have no control over, we could do one of three things:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ol\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Build support for our translation system to detect specifically which type of control it is working with, and translate the correct bits (maintenance nightmare)\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Build support into base classes (impossible, since all the controls inherit from different pre-defined classes)\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Add interface support\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;/ol\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So we did nr. 3. All our controls implement ILocalizable, which is an interface that gives us one method, the ability to translate \u0026quot;itself\u0026quot; into a container of translation text/rules. As such, the form doesn\u0026apos;t need to know which kind of control it has found, only that it implements the specific interface, and knows that there is a method where it can call to localize the control.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Code to the Interface Not the Implementation has NOTHING to do with Java, nor its Interface construct.\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This concept was brought to prominence in the Patterns / Gang of Four books but was most probably around well before that. \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;The concept certainly existed well before Java ever existed.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The Java Interface construct was created to aid in this idea (among other things), and people have become too focused on the construct as the centre of the meaning rather than the original intent. However, it is the reason we have public and private methods and attributes in Java, C++, C#, etc.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;It means just interact with an object or system\u0026apos;s public interface. Don\u0026apos;t worry or even anticipate how it does what it does internally. Don\u0026apos;t worry about how it is implemented. In object-oriented code, it is why we have public vs. private methods/attributes. We are intended to use the public methods because the private methods are there only for use internally, within the class. They make up the implementation of the class and can be changed as required without changing the public interface. Assume that regarding functionality, a method on a class will perform the same operation with the same expected result every time you call it with the same parameters. It allows the author to change how the class works, its implementation, without breaking how people interact with it.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;And you can program to the interface, not the implementation without ever using an Interface construct.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; You can program to the interface not the implementation in C++, which does not have an Interface construct. You can integrate two massive enterprise systems much more robustly as long as they interact through public interfaces (contracts) rather than calling methods on objects internal to the systems. The interfaces are expected to always react the same expected way given the same input parameters; if implemented to the interface and not the implementation. The concept works in many places.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Shake the thought that Java Interfaces have anything what-so-ever to do with the concept of \u0026apos;Program to the Interface, Not the Implementation\u0026apos;. They can help apply the concept, but they are \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;not\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; the concept. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;It sounds like you understand how interfaces work but are unsure of when to use them and what advantages they offer. Here are a few examples of when an interface would make sense:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;// if I want to add search capabilities to my application and support multiple search\n// engines such as Google, Yahoo, Live, etc.\n\ninterface ISearchProvider\n{\n    string Search(string keywords);\n}\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;then I could create GoogleSearchProvider, YahooSearchProvider, LiveSearchProvider, etc.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;// if I want to support multiple downloads using different protocols\n// HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, etc.\ninterface IUrlDownload\n{\n    void Download(string url)\n}\n\n// how about an image loader for different kinds of images JPG, GIF, PNG, etc.\ninterface IImageLoader\n{\n    Bitmap LoadImage(string filename)\n}\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;then create JpegImageLoader, GifImageLoader, PngImageLoader, etc.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Most add-ins and plugin systems work off interfaces.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Another popular use is for the Repository pattern. Say I want to load a list of zip codes from different sources\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;interface IZipCodeRepository\n{\n    IList\u0026amp;lt;ZipCode\u0026amp;gt; GetZipCodes(string state);\n}\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;then I could create an XMLZipCodeRepository, SQLZipCodeRepository, CSVZipCodeRepository, etc. For my web applications, I often create XML repositories early on so I can get something up and running before the SQL Database is ready. Once the database is ready I write an SQLRepository to replace the XML version. The rest of my code remains unchanged since it runs solely off of interfaces.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Methods can accept interfaces such as:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;PrintZipCodes(IZipCodeRepository zipCodeRepository, string state)\n{\n    foreach (ZipCode zipCode in zipCodeRepository.GetZipCodes(state))\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(zipCode.ToString());\n    }\n}\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;It makes your code a lot more extensible and easier to maintain when you have sets of similar classes.  I am a junior programmer, so I am no expert, but I just finished a project that required something similar.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I work on client side software that talks to a server running a medical device.  We are developing a new version of this device that has some new components that the customer must configure at times.  There are two types of new components, and they are different, but they are also very similar.  Basically, I had to create two config forms, two lists classes, two of everything.  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I decided that it would be best to create an abstract base class for each control type that would hold almost all of the real logic, and then derived types to take care of the differences between the two components.  However, the base classes would not have been able to perform operations on these components if I had to worry about types all of the time (well, they could have, but there would have been an \u0026quot;if\u0026quot; statement or switch in every method).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I defined a simple interface for these components and all of the base classes talk to this interface.

Take for instance a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;List\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.

You only code as to definition of List or what \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;List\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; means in reality.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You could use any type of implementation internally say an \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;array\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; implementation. But suppose you wish to change the implementation for some reason say a bug or performance.

JDBC defines a set of interfaces but says nothing about the implementation.  Your applications can be written against this set of interfaces.

A method which makes something \u0026apos;move\u0026apos; and any object (Person, Car, Cat) that implements the movement interface could be passed in and told to move. Without the method every knowing the type of class it is. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Imagine you have a product called \u0026apos;Zebra\u0026apos; that can be extended by plugins.

It loads all those DLLs and uses reflection to find any classes that implement \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;IZebraPlugin\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, and then calls the methods of that interface to communicate with the plugins. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This makes it completely independent of any specific plugin class - it doesn\u0026apos;t care what the classes are. It only cares that they fulfill the interface specification. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Interfaces are a way of defining points of extensibility like this. Code that talks to an interface is more loosely coupled - in fact it is not coupled at all to any other specific code. It can inter-operate with plugins written years later by people who have never met the original developer.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You could instead use a base class with virtual functions - all plugins would be derived from the base class. But this is much more limiting because a class can only have one base class, whereas it can implement any number of interfaces.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    ","\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;C++ explanation.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Think of an interface as your classes public methods.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You then could create a template that \u0026apos;depends\u0026apos; on these public methods in order to carry out it\u0026apos;s own function (it makes function calls defined in the classes public interface). Lets say this template is a container, like a Vector class, and the interface it depends on is a search algorithm.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Any algorithm class that defines the functions/interface Vector makes calls to will satisfy the \u0026apos;contract\u0026apos; (as someone explained in the original reply).

Readability allows others (and your future self) to understand the code with minimal effort. This is why readability leverages abstractions.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;An abstraction is, by definition, simpler than its implementation. An abstraction omits detail in order to convey the essence or purpose of a thing, but nothing more.\nBecause abstractions are simpler, I can fit a lot more of them in my head at one time, compared to implementations.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;As a programmer (in any language) I walk around with a general idea of a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;List\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; in my head at all times. In particular, a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;List\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; allows random access, duplicate elements, and maintains order. When I see a declaration like this: \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;List myList = new ArrayList()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; I think, \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;cool\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;, this is a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;List\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; that\u0026apos;s being used in the (basic) way that I understand; and I don\u0026apos;t have to think any more about it.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;On the other hand, I do not carry around the specific implementation details of \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ArrayList\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; in my head. So when I see, \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ArrayList myList = new ArrayList()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;. I think, \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;uh-oh\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;, this \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ArrayList\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; must be used in a way that isn\u0026apos;t covered by the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;List\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; interface. Now I have to track down all the usages of this \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ArrayList\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to understand why, because otherwise I won\u0026apos;t be able to fully understand this code. It gets even more confusing when I discover that 100% of the usages of this \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ArrayList\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;do\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; conform to the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;List\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; interface. Then I\u0026apos;m left wondering... was there some code relying on \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;ArrayList\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; implementation details that got deleted? Was the programmer who instantiated it just incompetent? Is this application locked into that specific implementation in some way at runtime? A way that I don\u0026apos;t understand?\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;I\u0026apos;m now confused and uncertain about this application, and all we\u0026apos;re talking about is a simple \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;List\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;.

Then my knowledge of the business domain is insufficient to understand the purpose of the code.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;So even when I need a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;List\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; strictly within a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;private\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; method (nothing that would break other applications if it changed, and I could easily find/replace every usage in my IDE) it still benefits readability to program to an abstraction.

So the tests look more like integration tests (having to make a complete \u0026apos;framework\u0026apos; of classes since all was tied together).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Fear of interfaces\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\nSo I decided to use interfaces. My fear was that I had to implement all functionality everywhere (in all used classes) multiple times. In some way this is true, however, by using inheritance it can be reduced a lot.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Combination of interfaces and inheritance\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\nI found out the combination is very good to be used. I give a very simple example.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;public interface IPricable\n{\n    int Price { get; }\n}\n\npublic interface ICar : IPricable\n\npublic abstract class Article\n{\n    public int Price { get { return ... } }\n}\n\npublic class Car : Article, ICar\n{\n    // Price does not need to be defined here\n}\n\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;This way copying code is not necessary, while still having the benefit of using a car as interface (ICar).\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n    "]},"randomTags":[{"name":"replace","slug":"replace"},{"name":"fetch-api","slug":"fetch-api"},{"name":"class","slug":"class"},{"name":"pygame","slug":"pygame"},{"name":"tostring","slug":"tostring"},{"name":"array-difference","slug":"array-difference"},{"name":"printing","slug":"printing"},{"name":"r-faq","slug":"r-faq"},{"name":"getelementsbyclassname","slug":"getelementsbyclassname"},{"name":"pecs","slug":"pecs"},{"name":"event-loop","slug":"event-loop"},{"name":"row-height","slug":"row-height"},{"name":"awk","slug":"awk"},{"name":"unity3d","slug":"unity3d"},{"name":"grouping","slug":"grouping"},{"name":"xmlhttprequest","slug":"xmlhttprequest"},{"name":"css-position","slug":"css-position"},{"name":"projection","slug":"projection"},{"name":"spl","slug":"spl"},{"name":"python-2.7","slug":"python-2.7"}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/questions/tag/[slug]/page/[page]","query":{"slug":"oop","page":"1"},"buildId":"DSpI0pSdXueTMCIVyw0q4","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"locale":"en","locales":["en"],"defaultLocale":"en","scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
