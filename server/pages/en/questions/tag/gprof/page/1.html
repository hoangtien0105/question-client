critiques.\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;There\u0026apos;s a simple observation about programs. In a given execution, every instruction is responsible for some fraction of the overall time (especially \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;call\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; instructions), in the sense that if it were not there, the time would not be spent. During that time, the instruction is on the stack **. When that is understood, you can see that -  \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;gprof\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; embodies certain myths about performance, such as:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;ol\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;that program counter sampling is useful.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nIt is only useful if you have an unnecessary hotspot bottleneck such as a bubble sort of a big array of scalar values. As soon as you, for example, change it into a sort using string-compare, it is still a bottleneck, but program counter sampling will not see it because now the hotspot is in string-compare. On the other hand if it were to sample the \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;extended\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; program counter (the call stack), the point at which the string-compare is called, the sort loop, is clearly displayed. \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;In fact, \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;gprof\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; was an attempt to remedy the limitations of pc-only sampling.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;that timing functions is more important than capturing time-consuming lines of code.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nThe reason for that myth is that \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;gprof\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; was not able to capture stack samples, so instead it times functions, counts their invocations, and tries to capture the call graph. However, once a costly function is identified, you still need to look inside it for the lines that are responsible for the time. If there were stack samples you would not need to look, those lines would be on the samples. (A typical function might have 100 - 1000 instructions. A function \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;call\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; is 1 instruction, so something that locates costly calls is 2-3 orders of magnitude more precise.)\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;that the call graph is important.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nWhat you need to know about a program is not \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;where\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; it spends its time, but \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;why\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;. When it is spending time in a function, every line of code on the stack gives one link in the chain of reasoning of why it is there. If you can only see part of the stack, you can only see part of the reason why, so you can\u0026apos;t tell for sure if that time is actually necessary.\nWhat does the call graph tell you? Each arc tells you that some function A was in the process of calling some function B for some fraction of the time. Even if A has only one such line of code calling B, that line only gives a small part of the reason why. If you are lucky enough, maybe that line has a poor reason. Usually, you need to see multiple simultaneous lines to find a poor reason if it is there. If A calls B in more than one place, then it tells you even less.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;that recursion is a tricky confusing issue.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nThat is only because \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;gprof\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; and other profilers perceive a need to generate a call-graph and then attribute times to the nodes. If one has samples of the stack, the time-cost of each line of code that appears on samples is a very simple number - the fraction of samples it is on. If there is recursion, then a given line can appear more than once on a sample. \n\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;No matter.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; Suppose samples are taken every N ms, and the line appears on F% of them (singly or not). If that line can be made to take no time (such as by deleting it or branching around it), then those samples would \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;disappear\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;, and the time would be reduced by F%.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;that accuracy of time measurement (and therefore a large number of samples) is important.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nThink about it for a second. If a line of code is on 3 samples out of five, then if you could shoot it out like a light bulb, that is roughly 60% less time that would be used. Now, you know that if you had taken a different 5 samples, you might have only seen it 2 times, or as many as 4. So that 60% measurement is more like a general range from 40% to 80%. If it were only 40%, would you say the problem is not worth fixing? So what\u0026apos;s the point of time accuracy, when what you really want is to \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;find the problems\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;?\n500 or 5000 samples would have measured the problem with greater precision, but would not have found it any more accurately.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;that counting of statement or function invocations is useful.\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nSuppose you know a function has been called 1000 times. Can you tell from that what fraction of time it costs? You also need to know how long it takes to run, on average, multiply it by the count, and divide by the total time. The average invocation time could vary from nanoseconds to seconds, so the count alone doesn\u0026apos;t tell much. If there are stack samples, the cost of a routine or of any statement is just the fraction of samples it is on. That fraction of time is what could in principle be saved overall if the routine or statement could be made to take no time, so that is what has the most direct relationship to performance.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;that samples need not be taken when blocked\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nThe reasons for this myth are twofold: 1) that PC sampling is meaningless when the program is waiting, and 2) the preoccupation with accuracy of timing. However, for (1) the program may very well be waiting for something that it asked for, such as file I/O, which you \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;need to know\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;, and which stack samples reveal. (Obviously you want to exclude samples while waiting for user input.) For (2) if the program is waiting simply because of competition with other processes, that presumably happens in a fairly random way while it\u0026apos;s running.\nSo while the program may be taking longer, that will not have a large effect on the statistic that matters, the percentage of time that statements are on the stack.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;that \u0026quot;self time\u0026quot; matters\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nSelf time only makes sense if you are measuring at the function level, not line level, and you think you need help in discerning if the function time goes into purely local computation versus in called routines. If summarizing at the line level, a line represents self time if it is at the end of the stack, otherwise it represents inclusive time. Either way, what it costs is the percentage of stack samples it is on, so that locates it for you in either case.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;that samples have to be taken at high frequency\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nThis comes from the idea that a performance problem may be fast-acting, and that samples have to be frequent in order to hit it. But, if the problem is costing, 20%, say, out of a total running time of 10 sec (or whatever), then each sample in that total time will have a 20% chance of hitting it, no matter if the problem occurs in a single piece like this\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;.....XXXXXXXX...........................\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; (20 samples, 4 hits)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nor in many small pieces like this\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;X...X...X.X..X.........X.....X....X.....\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;code\u0026gt;.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^.^\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; (20 samples, 3 hits)\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\nEither way, the number of hits will average about 1 in 5, no matter how many samples are taken, or how few.

Now the only thing executed is \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;, which executes in 1/32 of the time used by the original program.
