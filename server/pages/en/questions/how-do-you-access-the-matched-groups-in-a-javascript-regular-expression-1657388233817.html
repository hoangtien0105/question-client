What am I doing wrong?

I&#x27;ve discovered that there was nothing wrong with the regular expression code above: the actual string which I was testing against was this:
&quot;date format_%A&quot;

Reporting that &quot;%A&quot; is undefined seems a very strange behaviour, but it is not directly related to this question, so I&#x27;ve opened a new one, Why is a matched substring returning &quot;undefined&quot; in JavaScript?.

The issue was that console.log takes its parameters like a printf statement, and since the string I was logging (&quot;%A&quot;) had a special value, it was trying to find the value of the next parameter.

This lead to the proposal of the String.prototype.matchAll method. This new method is expected to ship in the ECMAScript 2020 specification. It gives us a clean API and solves multiple problems. It has been started to land on major browsers and JS engines as Chrome 73+ / Node 12+ and Firefox 67+.\nThe method returns an iterator and is used as follows:\n\n\nconst string = &quot;something format_abc&quot;;\nconst regexp = /(?:^|\\s)format_(.*?)(?:\\s|$)/g;\nconst matches = string.matchAll(regexp);\n    \nfor (const match of matches) {\n  console.log(match);\n  console.log(match.index)\n}\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\nAs it returns an iterator, we can say it&apos;s lazy, this is useful when handling particularly large numbers of capturing groups, or very large strings. But if you need, the result can be easily transformed into an Array by using the spread syntax or the Array.from method:\nfunction getFirstGroup(regexp, str) {\n  const array = [...str.matchAll(regexp)];\n  return array.map(m =&gt; m[1]);\n}\n\n// or:\nfunction getFirstGroup(regexp, str) {\n  return Array.from(str.matchAll(regexp), m =&gt; m[1]);\n}\n\nIn the meantime, while this proposal gets more wide support, you can use the official shim package.\nAlso, the internal workings of the method are simple. An equivalent implementation using a generator function would be as follows:\nfunction* matchAll(str, regexp) {\n  const flags = regexp.global ? regexp.flags : regexp.flags + &quot;g&quot;;\n  const re = new RegExp(regexp, flags);\n  let match;\n  while (match = re.exec(str)) {\n    yield match;\n  }\n}\n\nA copy of the original regexp is created; this is to avoid side-effects due to the mutation of the lastIndex property when going through the multple matches.\nAlso, we need to ensure the regexp has the global flag to avoid an infinite loop.\nI&apos;m also happy to see that even this StackOverflow question was referenced in the discussions of the proposal.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution1","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Heres a method you can use to get the nth capturing group for each match:\n\n\n\nfunction getMatches(string, regex, index) {\n  index || (index = 1); // default to the first capturing group\n  var matches = [];\n  var match;\n  while (match = regex.exec(string)) {\n    matches.push(match[index]);\n  }\n  return matches;\n}\n\n\n// Example :\nvar myString = &apos;something format_abc something format_def something format_ghi&apos;;\nvar myRegEx = /(?:^|\\s)format_(.*?)(?:\\s|$)/g;\n\n// Get an array containing the first capturing group for every match\nvar matches = getMatches(myString, myRegEx, 1);\n\n// Log results\ndocument.write(matches.length + &apos; matches found: &apos; + JSON.stringify(matches))\nconsole.log(matches);\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution2","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"\n\nvar myString = &quot;something format_abc&quot;;\nvar arr = myString.match(/\\bformat_(.*?)\\b/);\nconsole.log(arr[0] + &quot; &quot; + arr[1]);\n Run code snippetHide resultsExpand snippet\n\n\n\nThe \\b isn&apos;t exactly the same thing.

These are all instances of your pattern inside the input string.\nMatched groups indicate all groups to catch, defined in the RegEx pattern. (The patterns inside parentheses, like so: /format_(.*?)/g, where (.*?) would be a matched group.) These reside within matched patterns.\n\n\nDescription\n\nTo get access to the matched groups, in each of the matched patterns, you need a function or something similar to iterate over the match. There are a number of ways you can do this, as many of the other answers show. Most other answers use a while loop to iterate over all matched patterns, but I think we all know the potential dangers with that approach. It is necessary to match against a new RegExp() instead of just the pattern itself, which only got mentioned in a comment. This is because the .exec() method behaves similar to a generator function  it stops every time there is a match, but keeps its .lastIndex to continue from there on the next .exec() call.\n\nCode examples\n\nBelow is an example of a function searchString which returns an Array of all matched patterns, where each match is an Array with all the containing matched groups. Instead of using a while loop, I have provided examples using both the Array.prototype.map() function as well as a more performant way  using a plain for-loop.\n\nConcise versions (less code, more syntactic sugar)\n\nThese are less performant since they basically implement a forEach-loop instead of the faster for-loop.\n\n// Concise ES6/ES2015 syntax\nconst searchString = \n    (string, pattern) =&gt; \n        string\n        .match(new RegExp(pattern.source, pattern.flags))\n        .map(match =&gt; \n            new RegExp(pattern.source, pattern.flags)\n            .exec(match));\n\n// Or if you will, with ES5 syntax\nfunction searchString(string, pattern) {\n    return string\n        .match(new RegExp(pattern.source, pattern.flags))\n        .map(match =&gt;\n            new RegExp(pattern.source, pattern.flags)\n            .exec(match));\n}\n\nlet string = &quot;something format_abc&quot;,\n    pattern = /(?:^|\\s)format_(.*?)(?:\\s|$)/;\n\nlet result = searchString(string, pattern);\n// [[&quot; format_abc&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;], null]\n// The trailing `null` disappears if you add the `global` flag\n\n\nPerformant versions (more code, less syntactic sugar)\n\n// Performant ES6/ES2015 syntax\nconst searchString = (string, pattern) =&gt; {\n    let result = [];\n\n    const matches = string.match(new RegExp(pattern.source, pattern.flags));\n\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; matches.length; i++) {\n        result.push(new RegExp(pattern.source, pattern.flags).exec(matches[i]));\n    }\n\n    return result;\n};\n\n// Same thing, but with ES5 syntax\nfunction searchString(string, pattern) {\n    var result = [];\n\n    var matches = string.match(new RegExp(pattern.source, pattern.flags));\n\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; matches.length; i++) {\n        result.push(new RegExp(pattern.source, pattern.flags).exec(matches[i]));\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}\n\nlet string = &quot;something format_abc&quot;,\n    pattern = /(?:^|\\s)format_(.*?)(?:\\s|$)/;\n\nlet result = searchString(string, pattern);\n// [[&quot; format_abc&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;], null]\n// The trailing `null` disappears if you add the `global` flag\n\n\nI have yet to compare these alternatives to the ones previously mentioned in the other answers, but I doubt this approach is less performant and less fail-safe than the others.\n    ","url":"/questions/[slug]#solution7","@type":"Answer","upvoteCount":0},{"text":"Your syntax probably isn&apos;t the best to keep.

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
<hr>
<p>I've discovered that there was nothing wrong with the regular expression code above: the actual string which I was testing against was this:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-string">"date format_%A"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Reporting that "%A" is undefined seems a very strange behaviour, but it is not directly related to this question, so I've opened a new one, <em><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/432826/why-is-a-matched-substring-returning-undefined-in-javascript">Why is a matched substring returning "undefined" in JavaScript?</a></em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The issue was that <code>console.log</code> takes its parameters like a <code>printf</code> statement, and since the string I was logging (<code>"%A"</code>) had a special value, it was trying to find the value of the next parameter.</p>

<h2>Edit: 2019-09-10</h2>
<p>As you can see the way to iterate over multiple matches was not very intuitive. This lead to the proposal of the <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-string-matchall" rel="noreferrer"><code>String.prototype.matchAll</code></a> method. This new method is expected to ship in the <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-string.prototype.matchall" rel="noreferrer">ECMAScript 2020 specification</a>. It gives us a clean API and solves multiple problems. It has been started to land on major browsers and JS engines as <a href="https://v8.dev/features/string-matchall" rel="noreferrer">Chrome 73+ / Node 12+</a> and Firefox 67+.</p>
<p>The method returns an iterator and is used as follows:</p>

<p>As it returns an iterator, we can say it's lazy, this is useful when handling particularly large numbers of capturing groups, or very large strings. But if you need, the result can be easily transformed into an Array by using the <em>spread syntax</em> or the <code>Array.from</code> method:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">getFirstGroup</span>(<span class="hljs-params">regexp, str</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> array = [...str.<span class="hljs-title function_">matchAll</span>(regexp)];
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> array.<span class="hljs-title function_">map</span>(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">m</span> =&gt;</span> m[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]);
}

<span class="hljs-comment">// or:</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">getFirstGroup</span>(<span class="hljs-params">regexp, str</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Array</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">from</span>(str.<span class="hljs-title function_">matchAll</span>(regexp), <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">m</span> =&gt;</span> m[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>]);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the meantime, while this proposal gets more wide support, you can use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/string.prototype.matchall" rel="noreferrer">official shim package</a>.</p>
<p>Also, the internal workings of the method are simple. An equivalent implementation using a generator function would be as follows:</p>
<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>* <span class="hljs-title function_">matchAll</span>(<span class="hljs-params">str, regexp</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> flags = regexp.<span class="hljs-property">global</span> ? regexp.<span class="hljs-property">flags</span> : regexp.<span class="hljs-property">flags</span> + <span class="hljs-string">"g"</span>;
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> re = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">RegExp</span>(regexp, flags);
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> match;
  <span class="hljs-keyword">while</span> (match = re.<span class="hljs-title function_">exec</span>(str)) {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">yield</span> match;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>A copy of the original regexp is created; this is to avoid side-effects due to the mutation of the <code>lastIndex</code> property when going through the multple matches.</p>
<p>Also, we need to ensure the regexp has the <em>global</em> flag to avoid an infinite loop.</p>
<p>I'm also happy to see that even this StackOverflow question was referenced in the <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-string-matchall#previous-discussions" rel="noreferrer">discussions of the proposal</a>.</p>

<p>In regards to the multi-match parentheses examples above, I was looking for an answer here after not getting what I wanted from:</p>

<p>After looking at the slightly convoluted function calls with while and .push() above, it dawned on me that the problem can be solved very elegantly with mystring.replace() instead (the replacing is NOT the point, and isn't even done, the CLEAN, built-in recursive function call option for the second parameter is!):</p>

<pre class="lang-js s-code-block"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> yourstring = <span class="hljs-string">'something format_abc something format_def something format_ghi'</span>;

<blockquote>
  <p>With <code>matchAll</code> available, you can avoid the <code>while</code> loop and <code>exec</code> with <code>/g</code>...

<h2>Terminology used in this answer:</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Match</strong> indicates the result of running your RegEx pattern against your string like so: <code>someString.match(regexPattern)</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Matched patterns</strong> indicate all matched portions of the input string, which all reside inside the <strong>match</strong> array. These are all instances of your pattern inside the input string.</li>
<li><strong>Matched groups</strong> indicate all groups to catch, defined in the RegEx pattern. (The patterns inside parentheses, like so: <code>/format_(.*?)/g</code>, where <code>(.*?)</code> would be a matched group.) These reside within <strong>matched patterns</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>To get access to the <em>matched groups</em>, in each of the <em>matched patterns</em>, you need a function or something similar to iterate over the <em>match</em>. There are a number of ways you can do this, as many of the other answers show. Most other answers use a while loop to iterate over all <em>matched patterns</em>, but I think we all know the potential dangers with that approach. It is necessary to match against a <code>new RegExp()</code> instead of just the pattern itself, which only got mentioned in a comment. This is because the <code>.exec()</code> method behaves similar to a <em>generator function</em>  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/exec#Description" rel="noreferrer">it stops every time there is a match</a>, but keeps its <code>.lastIndex</code> to continue from there on the next <code>.exec()</code> call.</p>

<h2>Code examples</h2>

<p>Below is an example of a function <code>searchString</code> which returns an <code>Array</code> of all <em>matched patterns</em>, where each <code>match</code> is an <code>Array</code> with all the containing <em>matched groups</em>. Instead of using a while loop, I have provided examples using both the <code>Array.prototype.map()</code> function as well as a more performant way  using a plain <code>for</code>-loop.</p>

<h3>Concise versions (less code, more syntactic sugar)</h3>

<p>These are less performant since they basically implement a <code>forEach</code>-loop instead of the faster <code>for</code>-loop.</p>

<p>Your syntax probably isn't the best to keep. FF/Gecko defines RegExp as an extension of Function.<br>
(FF2 went as far as <code>typeof(/pattern/) == 'function'</code>)</p>

<p>It seems this is specific to FF -- IE, Opera, and Chrome all throw exceptions for it.</p>

<p>Instead, use either method previously mentioned by others: <code>RegExp#exec</code> or <code>String#match</code>.<br>

Most other answers use a while loop to iterate over all \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;matched patterns\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;, but I think we all know the potential dangers with that approach. It is necessary to match against a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;new RegExp()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; instead of just the pattern itself, which only got mentioned in a comment. This is because the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;.exec()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; method behaves similar to a \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;generator function\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/exec#Description\u0026quot; rel=\u0026quot;noreferrer\u0026quot;\u0026gt;it stops every time there is a match\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, but keeps its \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;.lastIndex\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; to continue from there on the next \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;.exec()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; call.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Code examples\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Below is an example of a function \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;searchString\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; which returns an \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Array\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; of all \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;matched patterns\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;, where each \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;match\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; is an \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Array\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; with all the containing \u0026lt;em\u0026gt;matched groups\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;. Instead of using a while loop, I have provided examples using both the \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Array.prototype.map()\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; function as well as a more performant way  using a plain \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;for\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;-loop.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Concise versions (less code, more syntactic sugar)\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;These are less performant since they basically implement a \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;forEach\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;-loop instead of the faster \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;for\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt;-loop.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\n\n\u0026lt;pre class=\u0026quot;lang-js s-code-block\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;code class=\u0026quot;hljs language-javascript\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-comment\u0026quot;\u0026gt;// Concise ES6/ES2015 syntax\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;\n\u0026lt;span class=\u0026quot;hljs-keyword\u0026quot;\u0026gt;const\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;
